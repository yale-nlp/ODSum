She's got something terrific in her guts and only\n   \n  her ice-cold lady engineer can coax it out of her!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1948.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of the\nTellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in the\nviscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with a\njaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\n  \n \n  Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\n  \n \n  The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  loomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the\nfat spaceship.\n  \n \n  \"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\"\n  \n \n  Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014\"Cob\" to his friends\u2014nodded in\nagreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship\nwith the poison personality.\" Cob was the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  Executive,\nand he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs\non the\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  . She generally sent them Earthside with nervous\nbreakdowns in half that time.\n  \n \n  \"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen\nthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I\nthought....\"\n  \n \n  \"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski.\n  \n \n  Cob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n  \n \n  \"The same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\n  \n \n  Strike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n  \n \n  \"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n  \n \n  \"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n  \n \n  \"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  because I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n  \n \n  \"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\n  \n \n  Cob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me again. The\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\n  \n \n  Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n  \n \n  \"Canalopolis?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded.\n  \n \n  \"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n  \n \n  \"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  nether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\n  \n \n  Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Cob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\n  \n \n  Cob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname. Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Old Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The\nthermometer stood at 135\u00b0 and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia\nGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's\nweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....\n  \n \n  And then it happened.\n  \n \n  Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the\nscrambler. It was a distress signal from the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  . The\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.\nRadiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.\nThe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly\ntrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering\npower of the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's\ndeathgrip on the battleship.\n  \n \n  A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,\nbut they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that\neven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  away from a fiery end.\n  \n \n  Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the\nflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n  \n \n  \"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\n  \n \n  She read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is\n   \n   it\n   \n  ! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\n  \n \n  He returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\n  \n \n  Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n  \n \n  \"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\n  \n \n  There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I\n   \n   know\n   \n  we can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained! I can take her in\nand save those ships!\" Her expression turned to one of disgust. \"Or are\nyou afraid?\"\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. But are you so\ncertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...\nit'll be the last. For all of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can do it,\" said Ivy Hendricks simply.\n  \n \n  Strike turned to Cob. \"What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter in\nhere?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley shrugged. \"If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.\"\n  \n \n  Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon.\nAnd me so young and pretty.\"\n  \n \n  Strike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\"\n  \n \n  \"Evans here,\" came the reply.\n  \n \n  \"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  and hold it. We'll home on\ntheir carrier wave. They're in trouble and we're going after them. Plot\nthe course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Strike turned to Cob. \"Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve the\nblack-gang in the tube rooms. It's going to get hotter than the hinges\nof hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir!\" Cob saluted and was gone.\n  \n \n  Strike returned to the squawk-box. \"Radar!\"\n  \n \n  \"Graham here,\" replied Celia from her station.\n  \n \n  \"Get a radar fix on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and hold it. Send your dope up to\nEvans and tell him to send us a range estimate.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain,\" the girl replied crisply.\n  \n \n  \"Gun deck!\"\n  \n \n  \"Gun deck here, sir,\" came a feminine voice.\n  \n \n  \"Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spool\nof cable. Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir!\" The girl switched off.\n  \n \n  \"And now you, Miss Hendricks.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain?\" Her voice was low.\n  \n \n  \"Take over Control ... and Ivy....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't kill us off.\" He smiled down at her.\n  \n \n  She nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. Smoothly\nshe turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....\n  \n<doc-sep>When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n  \n \n  \"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\n  \n \n  Peterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n  \n \n  \"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\n   \n   might\n   \n  be able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\n  \n \n  The nurse came out of the door.\n  \n \n  \"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n  \n \n  \"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eight days, in\n   \n   that\n   \n  ship.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n  \n \n  \"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n  \n \n  \"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\n  \n \n  She didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\n  \n \n  Peterson opened his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\n  \n \n  Patti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\n  \n \n  Roberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n  \n \n  \"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\n  \n \n  The Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n  \n \n  \"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n  \n \n  \"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\n  \n \n  Abruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n  \n \n  \"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\n  \n \n  Roberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kane stalked into the room at that moment, his face red with anger.\n\"\n   \n   Do you know where we are?\n   \n  \" he demanded. \"When those damned aliens\ngot me in that room, they explained what this is all about. We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n  \n \n  \"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n  \n \n  \"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\n  \n \n  He flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\n   \n   like rabbits in a snare!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n  \n \n  \"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Six months. We'll be bottled up in this crate for six whole damned\nmonths! And when we get there, we'll be prisoners!\"\n  \n \n  Marie's hypnotic spell was fading and once more her face showed the\nterror inside her.\n  \n \n  \"Don't feel so bad,\" I told Kane. \"It could be worse. It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race. We'll have our wives with us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll dissect us!\" Marie gasped.\n  \n \n  Verana scoffed. \"A race intelligent enough to build a ship like this? A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\n   \n   have to\n   \n  dissect us in order to\nstudy us. They'll have more advanced methods.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we can reach the ship's controls somehow,\" Kane said excitedly.\n\"We've got to try to change the ship's course and get back to the\nMoon!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible. Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\n  \n<doc-sep>Chip stared at his friend bewilderedly for a moment. Then he grinned.\n\"Hey\u2014I must be getting slightly whacky in my old age. I stand here\nwith an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I\nthought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a\nmyth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in\nthe middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks,\nwarbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.\"\n  \n \n  He grunted. \"A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this\nalleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad\nstory.\" He started to sing. \"'\n   \n   Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten\n   \n  \u2014'\"\n  \n \n  The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him.\n  \n \n  \"It's not funny, Chip. You've described the Lorelei exactly. That's\nhow she got her name. An incredibly beautiful woman who wantonly lures\nspace-mariners to their death.\n  \n \n  \"The only difference is that her 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in\nthe Belt\u2014and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising\nher vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since\nthen, no less than a dozen spacecraft\u2014freighters, liners, even one\nPatrolship\u2014have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been\nbrutally murdered, their cargos stolen.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Chip shrewdly. \"How do you know about her\nif the crews have been murdered?\"\n  \n \n  \"She has a habit of locking the controls,\" explained Haldane, \"and\nsetting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her\nhideout\u2014wherever it is\u2014for empty hulks. One of these ships was\nsalvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her\npirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He\ndescribed her. His description goes perfectly with less accurate\nglimpses seen over the visiphones of several score spacecraft!\"\n  \n \n  Chip said soberly, \"So it's no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I\nthought you were pulling my leg. Where do\n   \n   I\n   \n  come into this mess,\nthough?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ekalastron!\" grunted Johnny succinctly. \"A jackpot prize for any\ncorsair! And you\n   \n   advertised\n   \n  a cargo of it over the etherwaves! The\nLorelei will be waiting for you with her tongue hanging out. The only\nthing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you\ncan get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes. It was a light Syd Palmer\nwould have groaned to see\u2014for it usually presaged trouble. It was a\nbright, hard, reckless light.\n  \n \n  \"Hold your jets, Johnny!\" drawled Chip. \"Aren't you forgetting one\nthing? In a couple more hours, I can face the Lorelei and her whole\nmob\u2014and be damned to them! She can't touch the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  , because\nit's being plated right now!\"\n  \n \n  Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance.\n  \n \n  \"By thunder, you're right! Her shells will ricochet off the\n   \n   Chickadee's\n   \n  hull like hail off a tin roof. Chip, are you in any hurry\nto reach Earth? I thought not. What do you say we go after the Lorelei\n   \n   together\n   \n  ! I'll swear you in as a Deputy Patrolman; we'll take the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a deal!\" declared Chip promptly. \"You got any idea where this\nLorelei's hangout is?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's why I'm here on Danae. I got a tip that one of the Lorelei's\nmen put in here for supplies. I hoped maybe I could single him\nout somehow, follow him when he jetted for his base, and in that\nway\u2014\n   \n   Chip! Look out!\n   \n  \"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Stryakalski III, AKA Strike, is charged with commanding a run-down and faulty vessel, the Aphrodite. Aphrodite was the brain-child of Harlan Hendricks, an engineer who ushered in new technology ten years back. All three of his creations failed spectacularly, resulting in death and a failed career. The Aphrodite was the only ship to survive, and she is now used for hauling mail back and forth between Venus and Mars.\nStrike and Cob, the Aphrodite\u2019s only executive to last more than six months, recount Strike\u2019s great failures and how he ended up here. He used to fly the Ganymede, but was removed after he left his position to rescue colonists who didn\u2019t need rescuing. Strike was no longer trustworthy in Admiral Gorman\u2019s eyes, so he banished him to the Aphrodite. \nThe circuit that caused the initial demise of Aphrodite was sealed off. After meeting some members of his crew, Strike orders a conference for all personnel and calls in an Engineering Officer, one I.V. Hendricks. \nAfter Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks arrives--not I.V.--Strike immediately insults her by degrading the ship\u2019s designer, Harlan Hendricks. As it turns out, Hendricks is his daughter, and she vows to prove him wrong and all those who doubted her father. \nDespite their initial conflict, Strike and Hendricks\u2019 relationship soon evolves from resentment to respect. During this time, Strike\u2019s confidence in the Aphrodite plummets as she suffers from mechanical issues. \nThe Aphrodite starts to heat up as they get closer to the sun. The refrigeration units could not handle the heat, causing discomfort among the crew. As they get closer, a radar contact reveals that two dreadnaughts, the Lachesis and the Atropos, are doing routine patrolling. Nothing to worry about, except the Atropos had Admiral Gorman on board, hated by Strike and Hendricks.\nStrike and Hendricks make a joke about Gorman falling into the sun. As the temperature steadily climbs, the crew members overheat and begin fighting, resulting in a black eye. A distress signal came through from the Lachesis: the Atropos, with Gorman on board, was tumbling into the sun. The Lachesis was attempting to rescue them with an unbreakable cord, but they too were being pulled in. \nHendricks had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat, the one her father designed, and claimed it could help them rescue the ships. After some tension, Strike agrees and they race down to the sun to pick up the drifting dreadnaughts. \nStrike puts Hendricks in charge, but soon the heat overtakes her, and she is unable to continue. Strike takes over, attaches the Aphrodite to the Lachesis with a cord, and turns on the surge-circuit. They blast themselves out of there, rescuing the two ships and Admiral Gorman at the same time. \nCob and Strike are awarded Spatial Cross awards, while Hendricks is promoted to an engineering position at the Bureau of Ships. The story ends with Cob and Strike flipping through the pages of an address book until they land on Canalopolis, Mars. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Strike joins the crew of the Aphrodite after he has made several poor decisions while he was the captain of another spaceship. He is essentially being punished by his boss, Gorman, and put somewhere where he can do little harm. His job is to deliver the mail from Venus to Mars, so it\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\nWhen he meets the Officer of the Deck, Celia Graham, he immediately becomes uncomfortable. He does not like to work with women in space, although it\u2019s a pretty common occurrence. He holds a captain\u2019s meeting the first day on the job, and he waits to meet his Engineering Officer, I.V. Hendricks. He makes a rude comment about how the man is late for his first meeting, but actually, the female Ivy has already shown up. \n\nAfter meeting Ivy formally, he makes a comment about how the ship Aphrodite was built by an imbecile. Ivy immediately tells him that he\u2019s wrong, and she knows this because the designer of the ship was none other than her own father. \n\nHis first week as captain on the new ship goes very poorly. Several repairs need to be done to Aphrodite, they run  behind schedule, and the new crew members have a tough time getting a handle on Aphrodite\u2019s intricacies. \n\nThe heat index in the ship begins to rise, and the crew members can no longer wear their uniforms without fainting. Suddenly a distress call comes in, and it\u2019s coming from the Atropos, a ship Captained by Gorman, and the Lachesis. The crew members hesitate to take the oldest and most outdated machinery on a rescue trip. Strike has been in trouble for refusing to follow commands before, and he knows it\u2019s a risky move. However, Ivy insists that she knows how to pilot the Aphrodite, and she can save the crew members on the Atropos and the Lachesis from death. They are quickly tumbling towards the sun, and they will perish if someone doesn\u2019t do something quickly. \n\nIvy takes control of the ship, and the heat on the Aphrodite continues to rise steadily. Eventually, she faints from pure heat exhaustion, and she tells Strike that he must take over. He does, and he manages to essentially lasso the other two ships, and with just the right amount of power, he pulls them back into orbit. \n\nAt a bar, after the whole ordeal, Cob pokes fun at Strike for staying on the Aphrodite. He then admits that he actually respects Strike\u2019s loyalty to the ship that saved his reputation. Cob asks about Strike\u2019s relationship with Ivy, but Strike tells him that she has taken her dad\u2019s former job, so she no longer works with him. Strike takes the moment to look up her info, presumably to restart the relationship. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The narrative follows commander Strike as he begins his command of the spaceship Aphrodite. Strike comes from a long line of military greats but himself is prone to poor professional decision making.\n\nAs he takes command, the mission is a simple mail run. However, in the course of their journey, they receive word of two ships in dire need of rescue. Strike and his engineering officer, Ivy Hendricks, decide to use the ships extremely risky surge-circuit to aid the ships.\n\nThe rescue is a success and the crew is hailed for its bravery in saving the doomed vessels. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts in a muddy swamp on Venus, where Strike, a Brevet Lieutenant Commander, is encountering his new ship, the Aphrodite, for the first time. Here on Venusport Base, he is introduced to the executive officer of the ship, a man who goes by Cob. Strike comes from a line of servicemen who were all well respected, but he himself has more of a reputation for causing trouble by saying the wrong things or deviating from mission plans. His reputation preceded him, as Cob had specific questions about some of these events. The Aphrodite was incredibly impressive when it was designed, but did not live up to its expectations. It had been refitted, and the new mission that Strike was to lead was a mail run between Venus and Mars. As he entered the ship, Strike began to meet his new crew, including Celia Graham, his Radar Officer. Strike is not used to women being on ships and is decidedly uncomfortable with the idea. As he is briefing the officers who were already present, Strike is surprised when he meets his new engineering officer, Ivy Hendricks. Ivy is the daughter of the man who designed the ship, and she is cold to Strike at first, as he is to her. However, her expertise in engineering generally, the ship specifically, and other skills as well as piloting, meant that Strike warmed up to her as their mission went on. As the ship was flying towards Mars on their route, the crew picked up a distress signal from the Lachesis, which was trying to pull the Atropos away from the gravitational pull of the sun after it was damaged in an equipment malfunction. The Admiral who had put Strike in charge of the Aphrodite was on the Atropos, and Ivy dislikes him even more than Strike does, but they know they have to try to save the crews. Strike is hesitant, but Ivy has a plan and insists that they try. She has spent all of her free time tinkering with the circuits, and takes charge. She turned the Aphrodite towards the ships in danger, and sends out a cable to connect the Aphrodite to those ships. After they are all connected, the ships continue to spin towards the sun, which causes Ivy to pass out, leaving Strike in charge. He manages to pull the ships into line and send the Aphrodite in the right direction before passing out himself. The Aphrodite has the power to pull everyone away from the Sun\u2019s gravity, but the acceleration knocks everyone out on all three ships. In the end, it was a successful rescue mission of multiple crews. Strike and Cob find themselves in an officer\u2019s club at the end of the story, discussing Ivy\u2019s new job, and Strike acknowledges that Cob is right about the Aphrodite having grown on him, and plans to stay its captain."

Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood.

He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n  \n \n  \"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\n  \n \n  She read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is\n   \n   it\n   \n  ! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\n  \n \n  He returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\n  \n \n  Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n  \n \n  \"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\n  \n \n  There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I\n   \n   know\n   \n  we can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained!

But are you so\ncertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...\nit'll be the last.

It's good enough for me.\"\n  \n \n  Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon.\nAnd me so young and pretty.\"\n  \n \n  Strike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\"\n  \n \n  \"Evans here,\" came the reply.\n  \n \n  \"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  and hold it.

Smoothly\nshe turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....\n  \n<doc-sep>Lashed together with a length of unbreakable beryllium steel cable,\nthe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  fell helplessly toward the sun. The\nfrantic flame that lashed out from the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  tube was fading, her\nfission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms.\nStill she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she\nsave her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles\nof the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences\nthat spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for\nthe trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins,\nthe gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning\nto melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plants\non the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men were\ndying.\n  \n \n  Swiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In her\nflying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in\nthe darkened viewport.\n  \n \n  The temperature stood at 140\u00b0 and the air was bitter with the smell\nof hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with\nperspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped\nfor breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her with\napprehension.\n  \n \n  Carefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube on\nthe gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . It plunged\nstraight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up against\nthe hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly,\na robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure.\nLike cosmic replicas of the ancient South American \"bolas,\" the three\nspacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge\ntogether.\n  \n \n \n \n   They were diving into the sun.\n   \n \n \n \n  The heat in the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  bridge was unbearable. The thermometer\nshowed 145\u00b0 and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by\ncomparison.\n  \n \n  Ivy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came\nout of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field\nof vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit\nrheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious,\nbut too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument\npanel.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ivy!\n   \n  \" Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... the\nshow ... after ... all.\"\n  \n \n  Strike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the\ncontrol panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on\nthe surge-circuit.\n  \n \n  Slowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep within\nold Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into the\ncircuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the\ntube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships in\nspace slowed. Stopped. With painful deliberation, they swung into line.\n  \n \n  More power. The whine changed to a shriek. A banshee wail.\n  \n \n  Cob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. \"Strike, Celia's\nfainted down here. We can't take much more of this heat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're trying, Cob!\" shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. The\ngauges showed the accumulators full. \"\n   \n   Now!\n   \n  \" He spun the rheostat to\nthe stops, and black space burst over his brain....\n  \n \n  The last thing he remembered was a voice. It sounded like Bayne's. And\nit was shouting. \"We're moving 'em! We're pulling away! We're....\" And\nthat was all.\n  \n \n  The space-tug\n   \n   Scylla\n   \n  found them.\n  \n \n  The three ships ...\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , and old Aphrodisiac ...\nlashed together and drifting in space. Every man and woman aboard out\ncold from the acceleration, and\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  tanks bone dry. But they\nwere a safe 80,000,000 miles from Sol....\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command.

Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>A week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  had burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n  \n \n  For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n  \n \n  At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102\u00b0F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n  \n \n  Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath\nwas Celia Graham's notation that the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  carried none other than\nSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.\n  \n \n  Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into\nHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.\n  \n \n  And she agreed.\n  \n<doc-sep>  Jinx Ship To The Rescue\n  \n \n  By ALFRED COPPEL, JR.\n  \n \n  Stand by for\n   \n   T.R.S.

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\n  \n \n  Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\n  \n \n  The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  loomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\nto greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n  \n \n  \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n  \n \n  He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n  \n \n  And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\nthe sun like a great silver bullet.\n  \n \n  \"What...?\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n  \n \n  The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\nthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\nstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look\ncheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n  \n \n  \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\njoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n  \n \n  Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\nhappiness.\n  \n \n  \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\nwas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n  \n \n  I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel,\n   \n   Major\n   \n  .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\nfinality.\n  \n \n  I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd\nbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\npointing the stun gun at my middle.\n  \n \n  \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\nhave.\"\n  \n \n  Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\nsmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\ngoing to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\nit'll rain tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\nthis. Another of those funny Terran games.\n  \n \n  \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\nshould thank you, really.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\nwhen you decided to cork off.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n  \n \n  \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\nnudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\nsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n  \n \n  Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\naudible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\nlittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\nunimportant drama.\n  \n \n  I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n  \n \n  \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n  \n \n  \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\nunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\ngame, the fun?\n  \n \n  \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\nnever any trouble before you took command.\"\n  \n \n  \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n  \n \n  Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\nsay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\nOr maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n  \n \n  \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n  \n \n  \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\nsavages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\nThe perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the\ncolonel in puzzlement.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks is the daughter of Harlan Hendricks, a formerly respected engineer. He created the surge-circuit, an innovation in interstellar astrogation, and he was awarded a Legion of Merit. He designed three famous ships: the Artemis, the Andromeda, and the Aphrodite, the prototype. Despite being hailed as the latest and greatest in technology, all three ships either exploded or failed. \nAccording to Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks, their failures were due to the lack of education on board. She claimed that her father asked for the crew members to be trained in surge-circuit technology, so they could use it properly and correctly. That wish was not granted and after all three ships failed, his reputation and career were doomed. Admiral Gorman pulled the plug on his career and therefore became the target of all Lieutenant Hendricks\u2019 hate. \nWith a bone to pick, Lieutenant Hendricks, a knowledgeable engineer herself, comes aboard the Aphrodite to serve as her engineer and occasional pilot. She wants to prove to the world that her father\u2019s creation was genius and deserving of praise. \nAlthough they started off on the wrong foot, Lieutenant Hendricks and Strike, her commander, develop a friendship and appreciation for each other. They bond over their deep hatred of Admiral Gorman and the joy of piloting a ship. She soon proves herself to Strike, and he begins to trust her. Their relationship walks the fine line between friendship and romance. \nAs the Aphrodite is attempting to rescue the fallen dreadnaughts, Lieutenant Hendricks comes up with the solution. Due to her constant tinkering on the ship, she had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat and made it ready to use. Initially, no one trusts her, seeing as the last time it was used people died. But Strike\u2019s trust in her is strong and true, so he approves the use of the surge-circuit. Hendricks pilots the ship, but soon becomes too overheated and comes close to fainting. Strike takes over piloting and eventually activates the surge-circuit. It works and they are able to rescue the two ships, one of which had Admiral Gorman, her sworn enemy, onboard. \nLieutenant Hendricks receives a major promotion; she is now an engineer at the Bureau of Ships. She proved them wrong, and restored her father\u2019s legacy and good name. The story ends with their romance left in the air, but Hendricks has much to be proud of. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\nLieutenant Ivy Hendricks is the new Engineering Officer on Aphrodite. Strike and Cob assume that Ivy is a man before she arrives because they are sexist and because her name is listed as I.V. in the orders. Ivy is actually the daughter of the man who designed the award-winning craft.\n\nShe is cold and unfriendly towards Strike after she meets him, and that\u2019s probably because he makes a rude comment about the ship which her father created. After a couple weeks of working together, the two begin to get along very well. Strike admires Ivy\u2019s piloting skills and her depth of knowledge about the Aphrodite. \n\nThe two also bond over their shared hatred of Strike\u2019s former boss, Gorman. Strike feels as though he has ruined his career, and Ivy thinks that Gorman torpedoed her father\u2019s career. Ivy wants nothing more than to prove that Gorman is an idiot. \n\nHowever, when Gorman\u2019s ship is hurtling towards the sun and he and his crew members are about to die, Ivy sees that it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to show Gorman just how wrong he was about the ship her father designed. It\u2019s a very dangerous mission, but Ivy is steadfast in her decision and she\u2019s deeply courageous. She pilots the ship for most of the rescue mission, but eventually faints from the extreme heat. She tells Strike that he needs to take over, and he does a great job. \n\nIvy is then promoted, and she moves to Canalopolis, Mars. She now outranks her former Captain, Strike. \n",

She is fiercely protective of her father's legacy and resents Admiral Gorman for the way he treated him.\n\nHendricks and Strike, form an alliance of sorts after his initial surprise of seeing a woman assigned to this officer's role. When news arrives that two ships are in danger of falling into the sun, Ivy lobbies to use her father's technology to save the ship. Strike agrees to her plan although the risks are high. The Aphrodite eventually saves the ships although Ivy faints in the process from the heat and command has to be taken over by Strike.\n\nThe successful mission results in a promotion for Ivy as she works as a designer in the Bureau of Ships like her father.",
        "Summary_4": "Ivy Hendricks is the new engineering officer on the Aphrodite, having been transferred from the Antigone. She is a tall woman with dark hair and contrasting pale blue eyes, who has a very wide range of experience in ship operations and engineering. Her father, Harlan Hendricks, was the man who designed the Aphrodite, so she knows the ship needs a lot of specific training. At first, the captain did not expect her to be a woman, and managed to imply that many people found her father incompetent. Although she seemed cold at first, as she reacted to the situation, she and the captain eventually got along fairly well, as he learned to appreciate her wide skill set that ranged from engineering to piloting. Ivy and Strike also had a common enemy in the higher ranks: Space Admiral Gorman. Once Spike trusted her he appreciated that Ivy spent a lot of spare time working on the old circuits, so she knew the ship like the back of her hand. When the Aphrodite found the Lachesis and the Atropos when following up on a distress signal, Ivy new the ship well enough to be able to formulate a plan to save everyone. She piloted the Aphrodite carefully, using cables shot with a rocket to connect the three ships together, but the spinning of the ships in the heat inside meant that she passed out and had to leave Strike to take over for her. Her plan was successful; she was promoted, and instead of returning to the Aphrodite she started a design job with the Bureau of Ships."

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship.

When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n  \n \n  For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n  \n \n  At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102\u00b0F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n  \n \n  Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath\nwas Celia Graham's notation that the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  carried none other than\nSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.\n  \n \n  Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into\nHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.\n  \n \n  And she agreed.\n  \n<doc-sep>Old Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The\nthermometer stood at 135\u00b0 and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia\nGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's\nweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....\n  \n \n  And then it happened.\n  \n \n  Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the\nscrambler. It was a distress signal from the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  . The\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.\nRadiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.\nThe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly\ntrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering\npower of the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's\ndeathgrip on the battleship.\n  \n \n  A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,\nbut they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that\neven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  away from a fiery end.\n  \n \n  Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the\nflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n  \n \n  \"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\n  \n \n  She read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is\n   \n   it\n   \n  ! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\n  \n \n  He returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\n  \n \n  Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n  \n \n  \"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\n  \n \n  There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I\n   \n   know\n   \n  we can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained! I can take her in\nand save those ships!\" Her expression turned to one of disgust. \"Or are\nyou afraid?\"\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. But are you so\ncertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...\nit'll be the last. For all of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can do it,\" said Ivy Hendricks simply.\n  \n \n  Strike turned to Cob. \"What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter in\nhere?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley shrugged. \"If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.\"\n  \n \n  Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon.\nAnd me so young and pretty.\"\n  \n \n  Strike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\"\n  \n \n  \"Evans here,\" came the reply.\n  \n \n  \"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  and hold it.

She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\n  \n \n  Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n  \n \n  \"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles\nof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,\nwe have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant.

Lieutenant\n   \n   I-vy\n   \n  Hendricks?\"\n  \n \n  Strike looked blankly at the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley.\n  \n \n  \"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find\nto say.\n  \n \n  The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her\nvoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your\npermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I\n   \n   may\n   \n  be able to\nconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem\nto think ... a senile incompetent.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ...\nMiss ... but why should you be so....\"\n  \n \n  The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan\nHendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command.

Cob\nleaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the\nSpatial Cross on Strike's chest. Then he inspected his own and nodded\nwith tipsy satisfaction. He stared out at the Martian night beyond the\nbroad windows and back again at Strike. His frown was puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" said Strike, setting down his glass. \"What's on your mind,\nCob? Something's eating you.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded very slowly. He took a long pull at his highball. \"I\nunderstand that you goofballed your chances of getting the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  back when Gorman spoke his piece to you....\"\n  \n \n  \"All I said to him....\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. I know what you said ... and it won't bear repeating. But\nyou're not fooling me. You've fallen for old Lover-Girl and you don't\nwant to leave her. Ver-ry commendable. Loyal! Stout fellah! But what\nabout Ivy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ivy?\"\n  \n \n  Cob looked away. \"I thought that you and she ... well, I thought that\nwhen we got back ... well....\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a\ndesigning job.\"\n  \n \n  Cob waved an expressive arm in the air. \"But dammit, man, I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  . Ivy's a nice girl ... but....\" He paused and\nsighed. \"Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well....\"\nHe shrugged. \"Who wants a wife that ranks you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never thought of that,\" mused Cob. For a long while he was silent;\nthen he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to\nthe pages marked \"Canalopolis, Mars.\"\n  \n \n  And he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut\nStrykalski III was doing the same.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>  ACID BATH\n  \n \n  By VASELEOS GARSON\n  \n \n \n \n    The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments\nin his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid.

        "Summary_1": "Strike is a member of a famous, well-behaved, and well-trained service family. His father and grandfather served in World War II and the Atomic War, respectively. Both earned medals for their heroic service. Strike, however, did not follow in his family\u2019s footsteps. \n\tWith a tendency to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, Strike often offended those around him and garnered a negative reputation. After being put in charge of the Ganymede, he soon lost his position after abandoning his station to rescue colonists who were not in danger. As well, he accused a Martian Ambassador of being a spy at a respectable ball. Admiral Gorman soon demoted him, and he became the commander of the Aphrodite. \n\tAt first, Strike was not a fan. He sees her as ugly, fat, and cantankerous. He misses the Ganymede, a shiny and new rocketship, and views the Aphrodite as less-than. \n\tWithin the first week of flying her, the Aphrodite had a burned steering tube, which made it necessary to go into free-fall as the damage control party made repairs. Strike\u2019s faith in Lover-Girl continued to plummet. \n\tHowever, after Lieutenant Hendricks, the resident engineer, got her hands on the Aphrodite, Strike\u2019s opinion started to change. Her knowledge of the ship, engineering, and piloting helped him gain confidence in both her abilities and those of Aphrodite.\nNear the end of the story, the Aphrodite is tasked with rescuing two ships that are falling into the sun. Previously Lieutenant Hendricks had fixed up the surge-circuit rheostat, and so she offered it up as the only solution. Strike agrees to try it, which shows his faith and trust in the Aphrodite. Luckily, all things go to plan, and the Aphrodite, with Strike piloting, is able to save the two ships and Admiral Gorman. \nAfter Strike won a medal himself, finally following in the family footsteps, he is offered his old position back on the Ganymede. He refuses, and instead returns to old Lover-Girl. He has grown fond of her over the course of their adventure, and they develop a partnership. ",
        "Summary_2": "Strike is completely unimpressed by the rocket ship Aphrodite. He comments that she looks like a pregnant carp, and he knows that he\u2019s been assigned captain of the ship because he messed up terribly on his other missions. \n\nAphrodite was built 10 years ago, and now she is completely outdated and a laughing stock compared to the other spaceships in the fleet.  She was designed by Harlan Hendricks, and the engineer received a Legion of Merit award for her design. \n\nStrike\u2019s mission is to fly Aphrodite to take the mail from Venusport to Canalopolis, Mars. It\u2019s boring and straightforward.\n\nWhen a disaster occurs and two other ships, the Atropos and the Lachesis, are in serious danger of getting too close to the sun, Strike agrees to take the old girl on a rescue mission. He is convinced by Ivy, since she knows the ship better than anyone else and she believes in her. \n\nAlthough Ivy takes Aphrodite most of the way there, its Strike who finishes the mission and saves his former boss, Gorman, and many other people from certain death. Aphrodite is the entire reason that Strike is able to mend his terrible reputation and he wins back respect from Gorman. Although they got off to a rocky start, Strike finds it impossible to leave his best girl, even when he is offered a job on another ship. He is loyal to the ship that made him a hero. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Strike is assigned to be commander of the spaceship Aphrodite. The ship is assigned as a mail carrier for the inner part of the solar system. The Aphrodite is a dilapidated design with an awful reputation. Strike ended up with the Aphrodite as a result of a series of poor professional decisions that resulted in him getting command of the more prestigious ship Ganymede taken away from him.\n\nHis initial impression of the Aphrodite softens to a grudging respect after the successful mission to save the Atropos and Lachesis. Although he presumably is in line to command the Ganymede again, another faux pas resulting in Strike continuing to command the Aphrodite.   ",
        "Summary_4": "At the beginning of the story, Strike is very reluctant to accept Aphrodite, because being in charge of the ship means a demotion for him. His perception of the ship at the beginning of the story is colored by this history, and his first impression of the ship is not a positive one, even from the outside. Besides the actual construction of the ship, the technology that ran it was not something he showed much faith in. The first week that he was in charge after leaving Venus, it seemed things were going drastically wrong. When one important piece of equipment burnt out, the ship went into freefall, requiring a lot of repair work from the engineers, and anyone in charge of navigation was handed more work because of this as well. The ship was really put to the test when the Aphrodite responded to the distress call from the Lachesis, whose crew was trying to keep the Atropos from falling into the sun. Because Ivy knew the Aphrodite so well, and had been working on the circuits, it turned out the Aphrodite was the perfect ship to save the day. She could not see the rescue all the way through to the end, because she passed out early, but Strike was conscious a little bit longer and took over until he also passed out. After this unexpected rescue mission, Cob, the Executive Officer, noted that Strike has a newfound appreciation for the ship, and has no intention of leaving. Strike is dedicated to his new mission, even though at the beginning of the story he wanted nothing more than to pilot something the same rank as his old ship."

        "Summary_1": "Jinx Ship to the Rescue by Alfred Coppel, Jr. takes place in space, but more specifically in the Aphrodite. \n\tIt starts in the muddy Venusport Base on Venus. Venusport is famous for its warm, slimy, and green rain that falls for 480 hours of every day. A fog rolls in and degrades visibility. \n\tDespite starting on Venusport Base, the characters actually spend most of their time onboard the Aphrodite, a Tellurian Rocket Ship. The Aphrodite had a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built into her frame. She was bulky, fat, and ugly, and occasionally had some technical and mechanical struggles as well. \n\tAlthough her frame may not be appealing, she soon becomes victorious as she gains the trust of Strike and other members of his crew and saves two fallen dreadnaughts. With her surge-circuit rheostat rebuilt, the Aphrodite is finally able to accomplish what she was always meant to. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts on the planet of Venus. Venus has days that are 720 hours long, and rain is common. The rain is hot, slimy, and green, and it makes the already wet swamplands even more mushy. Fog is common on Venus.\n\nThe middle of the story takes place on the old and outdated ship, Aphrodite. She gives the crew members a lot of trouble on their first mission. She is in dire need of repairs, she\u2019s slow, and it\u2019s impossible to control her temperature. The crew members are unable to wear their uniforms because the temperature is over 100 degrees. \n\nAphrodite\u2019s mission is simple. She needs to take the mail from Venus to Mars, and it\u2019s the only thing she can be trusted to do successfully. So it\u2019s very impressive when she ends up being the hero of the day and manages to rescue two other ships that are headed towards the sun. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The narrative is set in the early 21st century primarily aboard the spaceship Aphrodite. The ship's mission is to deliver mail in the inner part of the solar system.\n\nThe ships route takes them around the sun and as a result the ambient temperature inside the ship begins to rise to intolerable levels due to proximity to the sun. Because of the heat, the coed crew is allowed to operate with very little clothing. Aphrodite is a ship of an outdated design that gives it a lack of comfort and subjects it to numerous small problems that make its operation frustrating.",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts at a spaceport on Venus, where it has been raining for hundreds of hours straight. The rain has stopped by the time the story starts, but it is left a lot of mud in the swampy marshes. It was nearing the end of the day, and the fog was enveloping the surroundings as it grew darker outside. It was hot and sticky at Venusport Base, but after Strike left the service on his mission in the Aphrodite, it would only grow hotter on board. The ship itself, where most of the story takes place, is an older, refitted, bulky type of ship. There were only two others like it, and their designer had been awarded a Legion of Merit for the three. However, this is the only one still in use, as the others were destroyed in a much earlier mission. Strike\u2019s disappointment in the ship seems to mirror the sentiment. Inside the ship, there are many systems of pipes connected the control panels, and the captain had to navigate carefully so that he didn\u2019t hit his head on the bulkhead. While in space, as the ship flew closer and closer to the sun, the interior of the ship grew hotter and hotter. The crew opted to wear as little clothing as possible in an attempt to handle the heat. When the Aphrodite received the distress call from the Lachesis, the ships were close enough to the sun to be affected by its gravitational pull. After the close call near the sun, once everyone regained consciousness, the story ends at an officer\u2019s club on Mars. It was a formal environment, and the Aphrodite\u2019s captain and executive officer planned the rest of their route from there."

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\n  \n \n  Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\n  \n \n  The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  loomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the\nfat spaceship.\n  \n \n  \"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\"\n  \n \n  Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014\"Cob\" to his friends\u2014nodded in\nagreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship\nwith the poison personality.\" Cob was the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  Executive,\nand he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs\non the\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  . She generally sent them Earthside with nervous\nbreakdowns in half that time.\n  \n \n  \"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen\nthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I\nthought....\"\n  \n \n  \"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski.\n  \n \n  Cob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n  \n \n  \"The same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\n  \n \n  Strike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n  \n \n  \"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n  \n \n  \"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n  \n \n  \"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  because I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n  \n \n  \"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\n  \n \n  Cob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me again. The\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\n  \n \n  Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n  \n \n  \"Canalopolis?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded.\n  \n \n  \"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n  \n \n  \"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  nether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\n  \n \n  Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Cob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\n  \n \n  Cob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  had burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n  \n \n  For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n  \n \n  At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102\u00b0F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n  \n \n  Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath\nwas Celia Graham's notation that the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  carried none other than\nSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.\n  \n \n  Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into\nHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.\n  \n \n  And she agreed.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Old Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The\nthermometer stood at 135\u00b0 and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia\nGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's\nweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....\n  \n \n  And then it happened.\n  \n \n  Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the\nscrambler. It was a distress signal from the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  . The\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.\nRadiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.\nThe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly\ntrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering\npower of the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's\ndeathgrip on the battleship.\n  \n \n  A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,\nbut they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that\neven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  away from a fiery end.\n  \n \n  Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the\nflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n  \n \n  \"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\n  \n \n  She read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is\n   \n   it\n   \n  ! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\n  \n \n  He returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\n  \n \n  Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n  \n \n  \"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\n  \n \n  There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I\n   \n   know\n   \n  we can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained! I can take her in\nand save those ships!\" Her expression turned to one of disgust. \"Or are\nyou afraid?\"\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, Ivy, I haven't enough sense to be afraid. But are you so\ncertain that we can pull this off? If I make a mistake this time ...\nit'll be the last. For all of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can do it,\" said Ivy Hendricks simply.\n  \n \n  Strike turned to Cob. \"What do you say, Cob? Shall we make it hotter in\nhere?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley shrugged. \"If you say so, Strike. It's good enough for me.\"\n  \n \n  Celia Graham left the bridge shaking her head. \"We'll all be dead soon.\nAnd me so young and pretty.\"\n  \n \n  Strike turned to the squawk-box. \"Evans!\"\n  \n \n  \"Evans here,\" came the reply.\n  \n \n  \"Have Sparks get a DF fix on the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  and hold it. We'll home on\ntheir carrier wave. They're in trouble and we're going after them. Plot\nthe course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Strike turned to Cob. \"Have the gun-crews stand by to relieve the\nblack-gang in the tube rooms. It's going to get hotter than the hinges\nof hell down there and we'll have to shorten shifts.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir!\" Cob saluted and was gone.\n  \n \n  Strike returned to the squawk-box. \"Radar!\"\n  \n \n  \"Graham here,\" replied Celia from her station.\n  \n \n  \"Get a radar fix on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and hold it. Send your dope up to\nEvans and tell him to send us a range estimate.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain,\" the girl replied crisply.\n  \n \n  \"Gun deck!\"\n  \n \n  \"Gun deck here, sir,\" came a feminine voice.\n  \n \n  \"Have number two starboard torpedo tube loaded with a fish and a spool\nof cable. Be ready to let fly on short notice ... any range.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir!\" The girl switched off.\n  \n \n  \"And now you, Miss Hendricks.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain?\" Her voice was low.\n  \n \n  \"Take over Control ... and Ivy....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't kill us off.\" He smiled down at her.\n  \n \n  She nodded silently and took her place at the control panel. Smoothly\nshe turned old Aphrodisiac's nose sunward....\n  \n<doc-sep>The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinking\npinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tiny\nfigure crawling along the hull. His spacesuit trapped and amplified\nbreathing and heartbeats into a roaring chaos that was an invitation\nto blind panic, and all the while there was consciousness of the\ninsidiously deadly Sigma radiations.\n  \n \n  Barry found the debris of the meteorite, an ugly shining splotch\nagainst the dull superceramic tube, readied his power chisel, started\ncutting. Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task\nrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on\nthe events that had brought him here.\n  \n \n  First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigma\nfor the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield was\nperfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been\ninherently poor.\n  \n \n  Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But men\nhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that\nhad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.\n  \n \n  Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been\nwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round\ntrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.\n  \n \n  But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government\nand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled\nto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by\nspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien\nconditions.\n  \n \n  On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to\nwhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.\nThat one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with\ncolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.\n  \n \n  Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the\nexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,\nhe had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus\nColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form\nwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to study\nnative Venusian materials.\n  \n \n  Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n  \n \n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n  \n \n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n  \n \n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n  \n \n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n  \n \n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n  \n \n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n  \n \n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n  \n \n  Then it was done.\n  \n \n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations.\n  \n<doc-sep>  IMAGE OF SPLENDOR\n  \n \n  By LU KELLA\n  \n \n \n   From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,\n    \n   it was a hell of a world for men ... and\n    \n   Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly particularly.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\"\n  \n \n  \"On my way, sir!\"\n  \n \n  At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman\nO'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already\nthrowing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble\nwhipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\nthe universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\nchance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\nthrobbing rumble changed tone.\n  \n \n  Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.\n\"Well, Mr. O'Rielly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\nBurner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn't you lock them controls before\nblast-off?\"\n  \n \n  \"If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,\" O'Rielly\nanswered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\nregistered before blast-off\u2014wouldn't it, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know yet, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\n  \n \n  The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\nthis ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a\nhundred years, so the instructors\u2014brisk females all\u2014had told O'Rielly\nin pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\nhad moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\nEarth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\nthrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\naboard gone in a churning cloud.\n  \n \n  Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\nthe thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any\nmore? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\nroom. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\nand a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner\nChief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\nofficers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch\nroom. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\nBy now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\ninquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\n  \n \n  Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\nmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly\nsaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\nsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\nhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\nthat way.\n  \n \n  She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\neither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\nO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\nof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I\ncouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.\nSo I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\nnaturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned\nresetting the control.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The other officers of the\n   \n   T.R.S. Aphrodite\n   \n  were in conference with\nthe Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flying\nbridge. She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale\nblue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\n  \n \n  Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n  \n \n  \"... and that's about the story.

        "Summary_1": "Strike is a member of an esteemed service family on Venus; seven generations of well-behaved and well-trained operators. Unfortunately, Strike struggles to carry on the family tradition, and is known for misspeaking and offending those around him. By trusting his gut, he wound up failing his higher-ups and crew several times. All this culminated in an eventual mistrust of Strike, which led to him being charged with the Aphrodite. \n\tHis deep hatred of Space Admiral Gordon is passionate, but not without reason. Gordon is the one who demoted him to the Aphrodite. At the start, Strike is checking out his new vessel and notes how ugly the ship is. After examining the ship and it\u2019s crew, it is revealed that Strike is uncomfortable around women and believes they don\u2019t belong on a spaceship. \n\tIn order to start flying, he calls in an expert engineer to come aboard and travel with them. Thinking I.V. Hendricks is a man, he is excited to have them onboard. But when Ivy Hendricks shows up, a female engineer and the daughter of the Aphrodite\u2019s creator, his world is soon turned upside down. \n\tHis initial negative reaction to her is soon displaced by begrudging appreciation and eventually trust and friendship. Hendricks proves his previous theories about women wrong, and Strike is forced to accept that perhaps women do belong on a spaceship. She especially impresses him with her total knowledge of spaceship engineering and the Aphrodite in general. And it helped that she hated Admiral Gorman just as much as Strike, if not more. \n\tWhile flying by the sun to deliver mail, the Aphrodite receives a distress call from two ships: the Lachesis and the Atropos, the latter of which carried Admiral Gorman onboard. After the Aphrodite reached orbit, the Lachesis reached out and reported the Atropos was falling into the sun, due to a burst chamber. They couldn\u2019t move those onboard over thanks to all the radiation, so the Lachesis was attempting to pull the Atropos back using an unbreakable cord. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \n\tSince Ivy Hendricks had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat--the feature that crashed the original Aphrodite--, they were able to save the Lachesis and the Atropos and regain some of their dignity and former glory. \n\tStrike is awarded the Spatial Cross, as well as Cob, his friend and longtime executive of the Aphrodite. Strike was asked to return to the Ganymede, a beautiful sleek ship, but allegedly said the wrong thing to Gorman, and was instead sent back to the Aphrodite. Cob believes he did it on purpose, as Strike had grown quite fond of Lover-Girl. \n\tIvy has gone to the Bureau of Ships to engineer vessels, a great upgrade from her previous job. Cob pressures Strike to reach out to her, but he refuses. However, it ends on a hopeful note, with the potential for romance between Strike and Hendricks, and even more adventures on the clunky Aphrodite. ",
        "Summary_2": "Strike\u2019s real name is Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III. After serving on the Ganymede, he is put in charge of the Aphrodite. He comes from many generations of officers. However, he doesn\u2019t feel like he fits the mold of his grandfather and great-grandfather and so on. His boss, Gorman, disagreed with several decisions he made in the past and sent him to work on the Aphrodite, the unimpressive spaceship.\n\nStrike does not like working with women in space, so he is disappointed when two of his crew members are powerful and successful females. He learns his lesson after working with Ivy Hendricks for a few weeks. She impresses him with her piloting skills and her knowledge of the ship that her father designed. \n\nStrike is skeptical at first when Ivy wants to take Aphrodite to rescue two ships whose crew members are in grave danger. He knows that the mistakes he made before got him on the Aphrodite, and there\u2019s a big chance that he\u2019ll be fired for trying to save the day, or worse, the mission could end in death for him and all of his crew members. He has feelings for Ivy, and her intense passion convinces him that she\u2019s right, Aphrodite can handle the mission and they can save those peoples\u2019 lives.\n\nIvy pilots the ship almost the entire route, but she is unable to finish the job when she passes out from the intense heat. Captain Strike takes over and saves the crews on the Atropos and the Lachesis. He is hailed as a hero, and he repairs his terrible reputation with the selfless act. He decides not to leave the Aphrodite. He wants to be loyal to the ship that worked so hard for him. He does decide to give Ivy a call. Even though she outranks him, he has to admit that he has a crush on her. ",
        "Summary_3": "Strike is the commander of the Aphrodite. He was originally the commander of the prestigious Ganymede. However a number of decisions made out of bravado as well as some unprofessional comments lost him that command.\n\nNow in command of a dilapidated ship, Strike comes to terms with his job. He commands a crew including a large number of women which makes him somewhat uncomfortable. His engineering officer Ivy Hendricks in particular seems to be of romantic interest to Strike.\n\nStrike ends up teaming with Ivy to save two ships from falling into the sun earning him a small promotion but an ill-advised comment prevents him from leaving the Aphrodite, perhaps to the satisfaction of Strike himself.",
        "Summary_4": "Strike is a highly decorated lieutenant commander in the Navy, who comes from a long line of ship operators. Although he has run many successful missions, he has a reputation of causing trouble\u2014his new Executive Officer, Cob, has heard a number of stories that he asks Strike for details about. Strike has lost command of the ship that he had been captaining, and is sent by Admiral Gorman to captain a mail route on the Aphrodite. He is extremely hesitant to have any positive feelings about the experience, from the ship itself, to the inclusion of women on its crew. Not only is this not the type of ship he is used to, he is never served with women on board. He has to navigate adapting to the new situation while adapting to the new job. Through the first week of his assignment, the ship and its crew grow on him. He comes to trust Ivy Hendricks, the Engineering Officer, and he lets her take charge to try to save the other ships when they respond to a distress call. Eventually, she passes out, and has to leave Strike in charge of getting the ships to safety. Eventually,  Strike passes out just like everyone else, from the ship\u2019s acceleration to break the sun\u2019s gravity. At the end of the story, it is clear that his increased appreciation for the ship means he plans on staying, to the delight of his Executive Officer. Cob alludes to Strike having feelings for Ivy, but he says that although she is nice, he has no interest in being with a woman with a higher ranked title than he has. "

        "Query": "What is Syme Rector's goal in Doorway to Kal-Jmar and how does he plan to achieve it?",
        "Article": "He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory\u2014and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection\u2014and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n  \n<doc-sep>  Doorway to Kal-Jmar\n  \n \n  By Stuart Fleming\n  \n \n  Two men had died before Syme Rector's guns\n   \n  to give him the key to the ancient city of\n   \n  Kal-Jmar\u2014a city of untold wealth, and of\n   \n  robots that made desires instant commands.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes\nimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.\nThen he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,\nand took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.\n  \n \n  Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the\ntranslucent Dome\u2014a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the\nstars shone dimly.\n  \n \n  Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he\nhad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n  \n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw\u2014the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n  \n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n  \n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n  \n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n  \n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then\u2014\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear\u2014but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n  \n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n  \n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself\u2014that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity\u2014that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n  \n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n<doc-sep>Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew\u2014they wouldn't have tried to stop us if\u2014Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field\u2014doors\u2014set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest\u2014as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then\u2014\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But\u2014he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n  \n<doc-sep>The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n<doc-sep>The tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n  \n \n  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n  \n \n  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\n  \n \n \n \n  Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n  \n \n  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened\u2014one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n  \n \n  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n  \n \n  The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n  \n \n  He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n  \n \n  He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

Rector shoots him in the chest, steals his wallet, and throws his body over the parapet. However, a hook on the patrolman\u2019s uniform catches Rector, pulling Rector over the parapet. He manages to unhook himself, and just as he estimates he can hold on one minute longer, a man comes and pulls him up. The man is Harold Tate, and he invites Rector to have a drink with him. As they get drunk, Tate confides to Rector that he needs a guide to take him to Kal-Jmar; he has discovered a way to enter the dome surrounding the city. \n\nThe two men set out on their journey and follow a gully they reach. While they are in the lower part, Tate sees something overhead, and a boulder crashes down just to the left of their sand car. A horde of Martians surrounds them and forces the two men to go with them. The leader reveals that the Martians are telepathic and have no need for a spoken language. The Martians want nothing to do with the humans because there is nothing to gain from the humans. The leader tells the men the history of the two species of Martians but says they will kill the men.\n\nWhen the leader pulls his gun on Tate, Rector launches himself against the leader and wrestles away his gun. He shoots the leader and the other Martians as he dodges their shots. The two men then begin walking toward Kal-Jmar and reach the city. Tate uses his device to create a hole in the dome but realizes it isn\u2019t strong enough. Then he thinks of using it where a door would have been, and it works. Rector shoots Tate, and just before he dies, Tate warns him, \u201cYou\u2019ll be--sorry.\u201d Rector takes the device and enters the city, noting all the treasures he can steal. He realizes he is hungry and takes two food tablets, but they don\u2019t satisfy him. Then a lifelike robot that is a feeding machine enters and approaches Rector. Rector is startled and opens his mouth, and the robot shoots a feeding tube into Rector\u2019s throat and pours xopa juice into him. The juice is poisonous to humans, and Rector dies immediately. The doorway to Kal-Jmar closes.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Syme Rector is one of the most well-known outlaws in the galaxy. After crashing on Mars, he is desperate for a spaceman\u2019s identity card so he can remain in place just a little while longer. He follows a young man until he can murder him with his energy pistol. But as the body falls, so does Syme, who was hooked onto the man\u2019s clothing. He hangs off the ledge of the building as disattaches himself from the boy. His body falls to the group, just as Harold Tate, physicist, rescues Syme. \nWith his victim\u2019s wallet in hand, Syme takes Tate to the bar and orders drinks for the both of them. Tate drunkenly reveals his greatest invention and desire to go to Kal-Jmar to test it out. Syme agrees to take him to the city, with the hopes of glory and money in return. On their journey across Mars, they run into the native Martians and are captured. These terrifying creatures take them deep down into the caverns, where some oxygen is present. Since the Martians are going to kill them, they are able to reveal some of their secrest. They tell them the story of the downfall of Kal-Jmar, show off their telepathic abilities, and more. Syme is able to escape and kill all the Martians, rescuing Tate who was of no help. \nThey continue their journey, now on foot, even though Syme was injured in the fight. Once they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate sets up his equipment. His first try fails, due to the enormity of the force field. His battery power is limited though, and he only has a few more tries left. He figures out that there must be areas where the force field is weaker, doorways in the dome. Tate locates one and they use his invention on it. It works, and the doorway opens. As they move to enter it, Syme reminds Tate to gather his equipment. As he does this, Syme pulls out his gun and shoots Tate in the chest. He steals his equipment and steps through the rapidly closing doorway. \nNow in the great city of Kal-Jmar, he takes his time and explores. The architecture was magnificent and decadent, a true treasure. He imagines all the money he can make off of sealing the artifacts and materials here. \nHe enters a building and discovers oxygen is present. He takes off his spacesuit and breathes in the fresh air. He takes two food tablets to ease his hunger, but it\u2019s not enough. A telepathic Martian robot emerges, still operable thanks to its companions. Its job is to detect hunger and then feed those who need it. After detecting Syme\u2019s hunger, it thrusts a feeding tube down his throat and feeds him poisonous lichen. Syme collapses and dies, leaving Kal-Jmar unexplored and undiscovered.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Syme Rector is an outlaw looking for safe passage out of the Martian city of Lillis after the crash landing of his ship. He stalks and kills a boy in order to gain access to his identification and attempt to leave the planet and avoid the authorities.\n\nHe meets Harold Tate who is looking for a guide to take him to the ancient city of Kal-Jmar. Syme agrees to take Tate to his proposed location. On the way they meet Martians who they engage and defeat.\n\nOnce they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate is able to open a door to the city. Syme betrays Tate, killing him. However Syme is himself killed when a robot inside the city mistakes him for a hungry Martian and forcibly feeds him poisonous food.",
        "Summary_4": "Syme Rector crashes his spaceship in Mare Cimmerium and gets through the translucent dome. He needs to disguise himself as an authority figure to enter the city, and he will need a spaceman\u2019s identity card to do that.\n\nRector worries that the Triplanet Patrol will soon realize that he is an intruder. He follows a young patrolman and shoots him with a flame in the chest. He then takes his identification card and throws his body over the balcony. However, he unknowingly attaches the boy\u2019s clothing to his own, and he begins falling over the railing along with the corpse. He lands on a roof and manages to unhook himself from his victim. \n\nHarold Tate comes along and helps Rector get back to safety. The two earth men grab an alcoholic beverage and discuss some secret plans. Tate wants to visit Kal-Jmar, an ancient Martian city. He believes he has discovered a way to penetrate a dome there that houses the Martians\u2019 incredible machinery, equipment, and records. Rector agrees to go with him. \n\nThe men travel in a sand car and are quickly attacked by a horde of Martians who throw a boulder at them and wreck their car. They surround the vehicle, armed with spears and guns. Syme and Rector go with the Martians underground into a cavern. \n\nThere, they learn that the Martians speak English, and they are also telepathic. The leader informs them that he has to murder them. First, however, he will tell them anything they want to know. The leader reveals that he and the other Martians are not a separate species from the ancients as a popular theory stated. However, they are also not the ancestors of the ancients. The two groups of Martians lived alongside each other for many years, but when Mars\u2019 atmosphere changed quickly, the other group was unable to adapt. \n\nRector\u2019s rage suddenly bubbles up, and he attacks the lead Martian before the thought even crosses his mind. He is able to pull the Martian\u2019s gun out of his hand and he hits him over the head with it. In an incredible rage, Rector takes down every last enemy. \n\nWithout their car, the two men trudge through the sand towards the famous dome. Tate takes out his invention, and after a few tries, it begins working. A hole in the dome opens, and Rector takes out his gun and kills Tate. Rector grabs the machine and goes into the dome. He immediately sets his eyes on platinum, ornaments, machines, books, and records. In his mind, he makes big plans to steal as much as he can carry and sell it immediately. He will come back for bigger items later. \n\nHe sees a robot rolling silently around the room, and Rector realizes that the robot is there to feed the Martians. Before he can even process the realization, the robot approaches Rector and shoves a liquid poisonous fungus down his throat. The dome\u2019s door closes, and Rector dies. "

        "Query": "Where does the story \"Doorway to Kal-Jmar\" take place?",
        "Article": "Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n<doc-sep>He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory\u2014and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew\u2014they wouldn't have tried to stop us if\u2014Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field\u2014doors\u2014set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest\u2014as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then\u2014\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But\u2014he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>My eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What happened?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Before we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\n  \n \n  The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\n  \n \n  The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\n  \n \n  Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n  \n \n  \"Miller!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\n  \n \n  I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\n  \n \n  Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n  \n \n  \"Miller, get help!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\n  \n \n  I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\n  \n \n  Static grated against my ear drums.\n  \n \n \n   Static!\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n<doc-sep>We slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\n  \n \n  A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n  \n \n  \"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\n  \n \n  We waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\n   \n   must\n   \n  be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\n  \n \n  Briefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n  \n \n  \"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n  \n \n  \"Do you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's.\"\n  \n \n  I helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\n  \n \n  Miller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\n  \n \n  For a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\n  \n \n  The next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\n   \n   Something\n   \n  pushed me!\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  He had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n  \n \n  ... and struck an invisible solid wall.\n  \n<doc-sep>He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and\nnow, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading\nmachine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\n  \n \n  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean\n   \n   through\n   \n  the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened\nit. It's only a door.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" said Rikud.\n  \n \n  \"You will what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"\n  \n \n  A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?\nThere's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of\nbreath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,\nand Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other\nend of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,\nRikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\n  \n \n  He missed the beginning, but then:\n  \n \n \n   \u2014therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this\ndoor. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the\nrigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may\nhave discarded it for something better\u2014who knows? But if you have\nnot, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship\nis a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is\nhuman-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not\npermit it\u2014within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and\nto avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be\npermitted through this door\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing\nwords. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting\nthan that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another\nvoice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.\n  \n \n  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle\nhumming, punctuated by a\n   \n   throb-throb-throb\n   \n  which sounded not unlike\nthe booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't\nblast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's\neyes\u2014he blinked and looked again, but it was still there\u2014cogs and\ngears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because\nthey shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\n  \n \n  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but\nno one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\n  \n \n  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might\nexist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one\nopened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\n  \n \n  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The\nviewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,\nalthough it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography\nwas different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had\nthought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way\noff in the distance.\n  \n \n  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his\nhand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new\nviewport. He began to turn the handle.\n  \n \n  Then he trembled.\n  \n \n  What would he do out in the garden?\n  \n \n  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly\nthought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud\ncouldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt\ndry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.\n  \n \n  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back\nthrough the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally\nthrough the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\n  \n \n  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did\nnot dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and\nsweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the\ngarden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could\nwalk and then might find himself in the garden.\n  \n \n  It was so big.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The setting of the story is on Mars. It begins in the city of Lillis, which is covered with a translucent steelite dome and is guarded by the Triplanet Patrol. One outstanding feature of the city is its Founders\u2019 Tower, which is the tallest building in Lillis. On the top level, there is an observation deck that looks out over the city. Outside the city is an area called the Mare Cimmerium. The planet has red dust and supports some life, specifically lichens and tumble-grass. It has mountains, canyons, gullies, and deserts.\n\nThe ancient city of Kal-Jmar features prominently in the story. It is an ancient city of the Martian race that was very advanced but is now abandoned. There are machines, records, and other objects left behind, and all are perfectly preserved inside a bubble-like dome that is formed by a force field. Humans have tried to enter the dome using explosives, diamond drills, and even tunnels under the city, but nothing they have tried has penetrated the dome. When Mars was first being conquered, humans tried to get into the city, but their efforts resulted in bloody battles with the current Martians, so eventually, the Mars Protectorate forbade any Earthmen from going near Kal-Jmar. The city has elaborate architecture and features a pair of twin towers. When Rector enters the city, he notices there is no dust, and the air is breathable. Doors open and close automatically. The room Rector enters has platinum ornaments set in the walls and the furniture. \n\nAs Tate and Rector travel toward Kal-Jmar in their sand car outside of Lillis, they note that Mars has a deceptively low horizon. The surface contains a series of dunes, channels, and gullies that they have to cross. The gully they follow is extremely deep and steep, and from the bottom, they can only see a small section of the sky. \n\nWhen the Martians take Tate and Rector to their cavern, it is approximately nine kilometers below the gully they were in. There is a sense of moisture in the tunnel they take to the Martians\u2019 cavern. In the cavern, the walls are covered with a phosphorescent glowing fungus, and there is air, although not enough for the humans to use. Some of the Martians eat the fungus. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Although the beginning of the story takes place on Venus, it quickly transitions to Mars. Specifically, the long-lost city of Kal-Jmar. \nWith a protective sphere, Kal-Jmar is impenetrable and the myth and folklore surrounding it are grandiose. Kal-Jmar is only one city on Mars (the last ancient city), where the rest of the Martians live. Many Terrestrials tried to access the city, to view the historic artifacts and glorious treasures, but each attempt only lead to infighting on Mars. Soon, the Mars Protectorate forbade Earthmen to travel on Mars, as well as perform any experiments on Kal-Jmar. \nThis city is rich with well-preserved artifacts and snippets of history that many vyed to get their hands on. This story surrounds the mysteries of this city as well as the desire and need to plunder it.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on Mars in the future. The planet has been colonized by humans to the extent that cities such as Lillis are covered with immense domes to protect from the harsh Martian environment.\n\nThe characters in the story head to the ancient Martian domed city of Kal-Jmar. They head across the parched Martian landscape and eventually head down a gully which is filled with moisture and even a phosphorescent type of fungus. Kal-Jmar is filled with treasures but otherwise abandoned.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Mars. There are parts of Mars that have been colonized by earth men, like the city of Lillis, and parts that the current-day Martians still control. One of those areas is Kal-Jmar, an ancient city that earth men know very little about. When Tate and Rector first come across the city, they immediately notice its fantastic architecture. Although it\u2019s in a state of decay, it\u2019s obvious that the ancient city was once beautiful. \n\nThe dome at Kal-Jmar is particularly fantastic. For many years, earth men have tried to figure out how to break through its forcefield. However, the dome is impervious to bombs, and even diamonds cannot break its shell. Inside the dome are all of the relics of the ancient Martian civilization. Records, machines, books, and precious metals are all hidden away behind its walls. \n\nSeveral thousand years before the story starts, the environment on Mars changed. The ancient Martians were unable to adapt and survive, but the current-day Martians understood the changes they needed to make to survive in the new climate. The Martians survive on elements that are plentiful in the area in which they live, like fungus, sand, and lichens. \n"

        "Query": "What happens to physicist Harold Tate in the story Doorway to Kal-Jmar and what is the plot about?",
        "Article": "Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n<doc-sep>Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew\u2014they wouldn't have tried to stop us if\u2014Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field\u2014doors\u2014set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest\u2014as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then\u2014\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But\u2014he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n  \n<doc-sep>He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory\u2014and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection\u2014and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n  \n<doc-sep>The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n<doc-sep>It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n  \n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n  \n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n  \n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why\u2014\" he\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.\n  \n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n  \n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.\"\n  \n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared.

        "Summary_1": "Harold Tate is a physicist who has developed a way to create an opening in the force field dome covering the ancient city of Kal-Jmar. Other humans have tried to enter, but none have succeeded. They have not been able to breach the force field, and efforts to do so led to bloody uprisings of current Martians, so the Mars Protectorate has forbidden any Earthmen to go there. Tate happens to be on the observation deck of the Founders\u2019 Tower when Syme Rector is trying to pull himself back over the parapet after getting pulled over it by the patrolman\u2019s body that he threw over the side. Tate invites Rector to have a drink with him, and when he is drunk, he tells Rector he trusts him because he has an honest face. Tate asks Rector to be his guide to Kal-Jmar and tells him about the device he invented. Tate sees the boulder that the Martians lob toward their sand car when they are in the gully and saves their lives by using a steering level to flip the car around and out of the main path of the boulder.\n\nWhen the Martians take the two men to their subterranean cavern and reveal that they can speak Terrestrial, Tate asks the leader many questions about the Martians. When the leader of the Martians starts to shoot him, Rector saves Tate by hitting the Martian, wrestling his gun away, and shooting the rest of the Martians while Tate cowers against the wall. When they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate uses his device to open the force field, but then Rector shoots him. As he is dying, Tate warns Rector that he will be sorry.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Harold Tate is an incredibly smart physicist who discovered the Kal-Jmar solution. More specifically, how to break through the impenetrable forcefield surrounding it. \nA relatively shy man, he is first introduced in the story by saving Syme\u2019s life. He pulls him up off the ledge, and then they run off and get the drink together. There, roused by culcha, he reveals his huge secret to the man he just saved. \nAfter showing him his invention, Syme agrees to guide him to Kal-Jmar. Tate had never been to Mars before, so he desperately needed someone to take him around. \nHis knowledge of the Martian race, when it comes to the scientific side, rivals that of Syme\u2019s, who\u2019d possibly run into them before. However, he is scared of the Martians and their unpredictability. \nAfter they are captured by the Martians, the leader announces their imminent death. While Syme orchestrates their escape by killing all the Martians with an energy gun, Tate stays glued to the wall. His cowardice annoys Syme, who was injured in the fight. \nIn the end, after they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate can open a door in the force field using his ingenus invention. The first time failed, but after careful consideration, he was able to succeed the second time. Once he had opened the field, Syme betrayed him and shot him in the chest with his energy gun.\n",

Traveling with Syme, he encounters a Martian resistance to his journey which they are able to overcome. Using technology of his own design, Tate is able to open a door in the outer door to Kal-Jmar. Immediately after this he is  shot and killed by Syme. He warns Syme that he is walking into a dangerous situation but he is ignored.",
        "Summary_4": "Harold Tate comes to Rector\u2019s rescue when he desperately needs help. Rector kills a patrolman and throws his body over a bannister. When Rector finds himself injured and unable to climb over the bar, Tate lends him a hand and asks very few questions. The two men get a drink together at a cafe nearby. Tate confesses that he trusts Rector right away due to his honest face, and he asks Rector to be his guide on Mars. \n\nMore specifically, Tate tells Rector that he wants to go to Kal-Jmar, an ancient Martian city that earth men are forbidden from visiting. Tate is a physicist, and he believes he has solved the riddle of the city\u2019s dome. It is an incredible force field that can withstand explosives and diamond drills. Tate believes he invented a machine that will force open the wall of the dome. \n\nWhen the two men are attacked by many Martians on their voyage to Kal-Jmar, Tate does nothing to help Rector defend them. He slumps in the corner and hopes to stay alive without attacking a single alien. Although he is very intelligent, he is not brave when he needs to be. \n\nThe men finally make it to Kal-Jmar, and Tate gets his incredible invention to work after a few tries. He creates an opening in the mysterious dome. Rector quickly kills him before he can even enter the magnificent space, and his only warning is \u201cyou'll be sorry.\u201d\n"

        "Query": "What equipment and provisions are essential for Syme Rector's survival in the tale \"Doorway to Kal-Jmar\"?",
        "Article": "He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory\u2014and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection\u2014and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n  \n<doc-sep>  Doorway to Kal-Jmar\n  \n \n  By Stuart Fleming\n  \n \n  Two men had died before Syme Rector's guns\n   \n  to give him the key to the ancient city of\n   \n  Kal-Jmar\u2014a city of untold wealth, and of\n   \n  robots that made desires instant commands.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes\nimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.\nThen he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,\nand took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.\n  \n \n  Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the\ntranslucent Dome\u2014a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the\nstars shone dimly.\n  \n \n  Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he\nhad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n  \n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw\u2014the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n  \n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n  \n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n  \n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n  \n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then\u2014\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear\u2014but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n  \n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n  \n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself\u2014that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity\u2014that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n  \n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew\u2014they wouldn't have tried to stop us if\u2014Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field\u2014doors\u2014set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest\u2014as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then\u2014\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But\u2014he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n  \n<doc-sep>The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think they'll\u2014\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\n   \n   whooshed\n   \n  into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n  \n \n  The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n  \n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully\u2014a tunnel, now\u2014getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n  \n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n  \n \n  \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\n   \n   Kalis methra\n   \n  ,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\n   \n   seltin guna getal.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n  \n \n  Syme swore amazedly.\n  \n \n  \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n  \n \n  \"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  \"But how\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\n  \n \n  He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\n  \n \n  Tate looked interested. \"But why this\u2014this gigantic masquerade?\"\n  \n \n  \"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\n  \n \n  Tate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you\u2014had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Tate thought again. \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\"\n  \n",

In the sand car, Rector relies on the car\u2019s metal arm and thick wire cable to travel down into the gully. He has harpoon guns that he and Tate can use later if they need to climb back out of the gully. After Rector battles with the Martians and shoots them, he uses a tube of sealing liquid that he carries in his emergency kit to seal the tear in his suit so that he stops losing oxygen. He also uses the sealant to close the wound in his leg from the graze of one of the Benson guns the Martians fired at him. Rector and Tate use oxygen tanks and space suits in their journey to Kal-Jmar because there is not enough air for them to breathe without these items. When he is hungry, Rector takes two food tablets that he carries in his helmet.",
        "Summary_2": "Syme Rector is an outlaw, a man that relies on his wits and his tools to survive. His grand experiences and adventures have taught him several lifetime\u2019s worth of wisdom. His most trusted tool is his handy energy pistol, which he uses many times throughout the story. This gun is powerful and quick and can be found holstered on his hip. \nHe also steals a spaceman\u2019s identity card, someone named Jones, in order to not be caught on Mars. \nHe uses a sand car to travel across Mars and transport Tate to Kal-Jmar. This car is equipped with an anchor, as well as a pulley, so one can safely descend and ascend.\n",
        "Summary_3": "At one point Syme using a tube of sealing agent to make an airtight seal of a tear in his spacesuit. Syme also carries a gun which he uses to shoot and kill the boy early in the story in order to steal his identification. He also uses the gun on Tate after he gains access to Kal-Jmar. Syme also uses a sand car to navigate the Martian Terrain and guide Tate to the location of Kal-Jmar.",
        "Summary_4": "\nRector would be immediately caught and punished if he were captured in the city of Lillis without identification. That\u2019s why the patrolman\u2019s identity card is so important. In order to get it, Rector has to stalk a young and innocent patrolman and murder him in broad daylight. He steals his wallet so that he can use his ID card, and he starts going by the name Jones. \n\nThe sand car is also an important item for Rector because its technology allows Rector and Tate to make their way through the sand and over the gullies of the difficult terrain on Mars. The car actually has metal arms that can go deep into the sand and lift the car up and over obstacles. Unfortunately, the car does not get the duo very far before a group of Martians attacks them and destroys the car. \n\nRector also has to steal the lead alien\u2019s gun in order to defend himself and his partner. He and Tate would perish if he did not have the courage to grab the gun out of the Martian\u2019s grasp and hit him over the head with it. He uses the weapon to murder the rest of the Martians and save Tate\u2019s life and his own.\n\nFinally, the entire mission to Kal-Jmar would be pointless without Tate\u2019s invention. As soon as Tate tells Rector about his work, Rector sees dollar signs. He wants to take advantage of Tate\u2019s knowledge and steal as many goods as possible from the impenetrable dome. As soon as Tate gets the machine to work and Rector knows he can go inside, he murders Tate so he can take everything for himself. \n"

        "Query": "What are the physical characteristics and behavior of the Martians in Doorway to Kal-Jmar?",
        "Article": "Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n<doc-sep>He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory\u2014and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n  \n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n  \n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your\u2014friend\u2014anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n  \n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why\u2014\" he\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well\u2014how about the Martians\u2014the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague\u2014and other causes.\n  \n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n  \n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan\u2014inferior\u2014culture.\"\n  \n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  It all began on a Saturday\nnight at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  . If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Don't you see,\" the lady continued. \"Everything that Xartal put on\npaper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoos\nare like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the power\nof copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mental\nimage of what they have seen. In other words their brains form a\npowerful photographic impression of the object. That impression is\nthen transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to common\nfoci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brain\nvibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the light\nfield to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.\"\n  \n \n  The Larynx manager nodded slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"But why don't the\nbirds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and\nmade a greater impression on their brains,\" Grannie replied.\n  \n \n  Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicate\nof Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and the\nimage of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" the operator said. \"I've used too much power already. Have to\ngive the generators a chance to build it up again.\"\n  \n \n  Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.\n  \n \n  \"That explains something at any rate,\" the old prospector said. \"But\nhow about that Red spot fever?\"\n  \n \n  On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I opened\nit and found it contained the case histories of those men who had been\nattacked by the strange malady.\n  \n \n  Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient had\nreceived the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but while\nsleeping or lounging in the barracks.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp that\nled to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a low\nrectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.\n  \n \n  Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In those\nbunks some thirty men lay sleeping.\n  \n \n  The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stood\nthere, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walk\ntoward that window.\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dull\nmetal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The central\npart of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and as\nI seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.\n  \n \n  All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-red\nrays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens to\nconcentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockwork\nserved a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lens\nslowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.\n  \n \n  I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.\nBack in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:\n  \n \n  \"Turn it on!\"\n  \n \n  The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.\nI stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, nor\nwas Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at the\ncontrols was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew\u2014they wouldn't have tried to stop us if\u2014Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field\u2014doors\u2014set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest\u2014as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then\u2014\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But\u2014he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n  \n<doc-sep>When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction.

He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I.

The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "From the humans' perspective, the Martians are strange, unpredictable beings. They eat sand to get their oxygen, and lichens, fungi, and tumble-grass from the deserts, all of which contain substances like arsenic that are deadly poisons to humans. The humans believe the Martians cannot or will not learn their language, Terrestrial, and that they have their own language. In it, every word can have multiple meanings depending on the inflection used by the speaker. In truth, the Martians have been telepathic for several thousand years because the planet is practically airless. They are clever and only pretend not to understand Terrestrial, and they make up their complicated language to deceive the humans. \n\nMartians want no contact with humans because the Martians have nothing to gain from contact with them. They see the humans as imperialistic. They plan to kill Rector and Tate as part of their concept of justice. The Martians know that Kal-Jmar holds the secret that would make Mars have an Earthlike atmosphere within fifty years. The ancient Kal-Jmar Martians were the contemporaries of the current Martians' ancestors. When the atmosphere of Mars began thinning several thousand years earlier, the Kal-Jmar Martians sealed themselves in their dome where they died of plague and other causes, while the other Martians adapted to the change. \n\nThe Martians look like they have six legs but really have four legs and two arms. Their torsos bulge because they have a huge air bladder. They look a bit like dogs but have high foreheads and lips that are not split. They are covered with patches of black and white fur; with their muscles, they can control the patches so that they are primarily black or white, depending on the temperature. They can use weapons and are armed with spears and Benson guns when they confront Rector and Tate. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The ancient Martians, as is revealed later in the story, faced an urgent dilemma when the atmosphere surrounding Mars changed. They could either hide and make scientific changes to survive. Or they could stay where they were and adapt. One group hid in the city of Kal-Jmar, constructing an impenetrable dome around themselves. They remained the same for many years until a plague wiped out the entire population. \nThe other group was able to survive the atmospheric collapse by changing with it. Their dependence on oxygen lessened. They eat sand to get oxygen, as well as breathing it in the deep caverns below. They can eat poisonous lichens and mushrooms, fungi that would kill any other creature. \nAnd their bodies changed too. Now, they resemble dogs, with fur that changes color depending on the weather. With four legs and two arms, they are incredibly quick creatures. Their stomachs bulged out from their body, due to their evolutionary changes. The Martians are also telepathic, with no current language of their own. They are an incredibly advanced race. They developed air bladders that pumped oxygen from the stomach (sand) directly to the bloodstream. These are the native Martians, and, though energy guns were forbidden on Mars, some of them were armed with them. Others carry spears and other missiles.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Martians have 4 legs and 2 arms. They are telepathic which aids in their communication on a planet with very little atmosphere. It is thought that they speak an immensely complex language and cannot speak to humans. This, however, is a deception on the part of the Martians who can speak to humans perfectly well. The Martians who currently live on the planet have adapted to live on the planet with no atmosphere. Their species' ancient contemporaries sealed themselves in cities like Kal-Jmar instead of adapting. ",
        "Summary_4": "The ancient Martians and a prolific species. They have thousands of machines and artifacts that they have created, and they preserved all of their equipment and accomplishments inside an impenetrable dome. Now, the current-day Martians protect the dome. The current-day Martians lived alongside the ancient Martians until the atmosphere on Mars changed rapidly and the ancients could not evolve quickly enough. \n\nThe current-day Martians are very different from earth men. Although they breathe oxygen, they also eat sand, fungi, and lichens. They do not come to cities where earth men preside, and they refuse to speak their tongue. The creatures have four legs and two arms, and they move incredibly fast. Their faces resemble dogs, except that they have large foreheads. Thick black fur covers their faces, and using their muscles sometimes turns the fur white. The Martians are also telepathic, but only Tate and Rector learn this fact. The rest of the earth men do not consider it a possibility. The species is very deceitful. They made up a fake language so that the earth men would not know their true tongue, and they pretend they cannot speak terrestrial although they truly can. \n"

        "Query": "What is the plot of RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN?",
        "Article": "Twenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears\u2014or no ears at all\u2014but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\ncovered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\nwith a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\ngray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\n  \n \n  \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\n  \n \n  The guard blinked at it.\n  \n \n  \"Whassat?\"\n  \n \n  \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\nsays he's out to lunch.\"\n  \n \n  The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\nagainst the handrail.\n  \n \n  \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\nright into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\nwent to his knees.\n  \n \n  \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\npast while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\nover the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\n  \n \n  A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\nalong the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\nThe door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\nfloor. It was expensive looking baggage.\n  \n \n  Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\nflorid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\nthe open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\nclamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\nhe backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\n  \n \n  \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\nout of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\n  \n \n  \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr.\nTony's room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\nsat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\nthe corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\noversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\nglanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n  \n \n  \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\nout?\"\n  \n \n  Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\nhandle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\nthe trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\nfar wall of the corridor and burst.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\nface of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, you must be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If you'll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\nthe door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire\u2014\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a\nblade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us\nbranded as warmongers? Frankly\u2014is this a closed line?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n  \n \n  \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a\ndifficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation\nto a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"\nRetief said. \"Any connection?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n  \n \n  \"Who gets them?\"\n  \n \n  \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized\ntransshipment of grant material?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan\nrepresentative.\"\n  \n \n  \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But\nlook here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang\noff, buzzed the secretary.\n  \n \n  \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new\napplications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement\nof students.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.\nMr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced\nman in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab\nshirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  by KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Retief knew the importance of sealed\n   \n  orders\u2014and the need to keep them that way!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"It's true,\" Consul Passwyn said, \"I requested assignment as principal\nofficer at a small post.

Here in this backwater\nsystem particularly\u2014\" He paused, blinked at Retief and cleared his\nthroat. \"Not that a bit of travel isn't an excellent thing for a\njunior officer. Marvelous experience.\"\n  \n \n  He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagram\nappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger disk\nrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating the\ninnermost planet.\n  \n \n  \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers\u2014a\nmere handful of them\u2014have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with\nan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq.

However I\nhave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to\ntake certain action.\" He swung back to face Retief. \"I'm sending you\nin to handle the situation, Retief\u2014under sealed orders.\" He picked\nup a fat buff envelope. \"A pity they didn't see fit to order the\nTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.\nI'm expected to produce a miracle\u2014a rapprochement between Terrestrial\nand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure\nwould look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.\"\n  \n \n  He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,\" Retief said, \"until the\nTerrestrial settlers arrived.\"\n  \n \n  \"Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.\" Passwyn fixed Retief\nwith a watery eye. \"You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a\ndelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu\nelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at\nSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,\nyou'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less than\nan hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's this native life form like?\" Retief asked, getting to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"When you get back,\" said Passwyn, \"you tell me.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was an hour before dawn when Retief keyed the combination to the\nsafe-lock and stepped into the darkened consular office. He looked\ntired.\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl, dozing in a chair, awoke with a start. She looked at\nRetief, rose and snapped on a light, turned to stare.\n  \n \n  \"What in the world\u2014Where have you been? What's happened to your\nclothing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got a little dirty. Don't worry about it.\" Retief went to his desk,\nopened a drawer and replaced the needler.\n  \n \n  \"Where have you been?\" Miss Meuhl demanded. \"I stayed here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad you did,\" Retief said. \"I hope you piled up a supply of food\nand water from the dispenser, too. We'll be holed up here for a week,\nat least.\" He jotted figures on a pad. \"Warm up the official sender. I\nhave a long transmission for Regional Headquarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to tell me where you've been?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have a message to get off first, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said sharply.\n\"I've been to the Foreign Ministry,\" he added. \"I'll tell you all about\nit later.\"\n  \n \n  \"At this hour? There's no one there....\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl gasped. \"You mean you broke in? You burgled the Foreign\nOffice?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Retief said calmly. \"Now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This is absolutely the end!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"Thank heaven I've\nalready\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get that sender going, woman!\" Retief snapped. \"This is important.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've already done so, Mr. Retief!\" Miss Meuhl said harshly. \"I've been\nwaiting for you to come back here....\" She turned to the communicator,\nflipped levers. The screen snapped aglow, and a wavering long-distance\nimage appeared.\n  \n \n  \"He's here now,\" Miss Meuhl said to the screen. She looked at Retief\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  \"That's good,\" Retief said. \"I don't think the Groaci can knock us off\nthe air, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I have done my duty, Mr. Retief,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"I made a full\nreport to Regional Headquarters last night, as soon as you left this\noffice. Any doubts I may have had as to the rightness of that decision\nhave been completely dispelled by what you've just told me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at her levelly. \"You've been a busy girl, Miss Meuhl. Did\nyou mention the six Terrestrials who were killed here?\"\n  \n \n  \"That had no bearing on the matter of your wild behavior! I must say,\nin all my years in the Corps, I've never encountered a personality less\nsuited to diplomatic work.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Consul Passwyn glanced up at Retief, went on perusing a paper.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Retief,\" he said absently. \"I thought you were over on\nPueblo, or Mud-flat, or whatever they call that desert.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm back.\"\n  \n \n  Passwyn eyed him sharply. \"Well, well, what is it you need, man? Speak\nup. Don't expect me to request any military assistance, no matter how\nthings are....\"\n  \n \n  Retief passed a bundle of documents across the desk. \"Here's the\nTreaty. And a Mutual Assistance Pact declaration and a trade agreement.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eh?\" Passwyn picked up the papers, riffled through them. He leaned\nback in his chair, beamed.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Retief. Expeditiously handled.\" He stopped, blinked at Retief.\n\"You seem to have a bruise on your jaw. I hope you've been conducting\nyourself as befits a member of the Embassy staff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I attended a sporting event,\" Retief said. \"One of the players got a\nlittle excited.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... it's one of the hazards of the profession. One must\npretend an interest in such matters.\" Passwyn rose, extended a hand.\n\"You've done well, my boy. Let this teach you the value of following\ninstructions to the letter.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, by the hall incinerator drop, Retief paused long enough to\ntake from his briefcase a large buff envelope, still sealed, and drop\nit in the slot.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>The second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n  \n \n  \"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n  \n \n  Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n  \n \n  Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n  \n \n  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n  \n \n  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n  \n \n  \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n  \n \n  \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n  \n \n  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n  \n \n  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n  \n \n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n  \n \n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n  \n \n  At least not willingly....\n  \n \n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": " The story begins with Consul Passwyn giving an assignment in a sealed envelope to Vice-Consul Retief, who is a diplomat with the Embassy. His mission is to visit the planet of Adobe and broker a land treaty between the Terrestrial settlers and an invading species, the Jaq. Before Retief leaves, Passwyn stresses the importance of following his orders exactly as written and acknowledges that no one from the Embassy has visited Adobe before, nor do they know the characteristics of the Jaq. Retief gets a ride to Adobe on a mail carrier with the help of a veteran pilot. When the pilot discovers they are entering the planet in the midst of war, he decides to leave on a lifeboat and gives control of the skiff to Retief. Then, Retief crash lands the skiff in order to avoid being blown up by a fission missile that was tracking him on his course. He lands in the middle of an Adoban oasis and immediately encounters a Terrestrial man named Potter, who confuses him for the cousin of one of his associates, Lemuel. Potter tells Retief about his group's history with the Jaqs, whom he refers to as \"Flap-jacks\" due to their wide, flat, tentacled bodies. Along with a team of settlers including Swazey, Lemuel, and Bert, Potter has been spending his days protecting his farms against attacks by the Jaqs after they mistakenly killed one three months prior, having mistaken it for one of the native species. Potter and his team do not trust the Embassy, having heard they are sending a representative to tell them to ceded control of the oases to the Jaqs. When they discover Retief is not Lemuel's cousin, Lemuel confronts Retief, who swiftly establishes his authority by knocking him out cold. When the group senses a Jaq nearby, Retief insists on dealing with the issue by himself. He hunts down the Jaq, they wrestle, and he assumes control by pressing his thumb against the Jaq\u2019s eye hole. The captive Jaq leads Retief to the Jaq headquarters, where he is introduced to their leader, Hoshick. Retief discovers the affability of the species and particularly their penchant for proper sportsmanship. He uses this knowledge to his advantage, and convinces Hoshick that it would be more sportsmanlike to abandon the war efforts and solve their differences through a simple wrestling match. Once again, he wins the match by squeezing his thumb against Hoshick\u2019s eye hole, and he convinces Hoshick to agree to cede control of the entirety of the oases to the Terrestrials and his people would be gifted all of the planets\u2019 desert areas. Upon returning to the Embassy, Retief tells Consul Passwyn the good news and then burns the envelope Passwyn had given him at the beginning of the story.",
        "Summary_2": "Consul Passwyn sends Vice-Consul Retief to Adobe to negotiate a peace deal between the native Jaqs and the human settlers who have moved there. Retief travels to Adobe on the mail ship, but as they near the planet, the pilot points out that there is fighting going on that he can see from fifty miles out; he refuses to land there to deliver Retief but offers Retief the use of the skiff. \n\nAs Retief begins heading toward the planet, he is tracked by a fission weapon. He outmaneuvers the bomb and lands on the planet where he soon encounters one of the settlers. They fight until the man realizes Retief is a human, introduces himself as Potter, and takes Retief to his camp where other men are. The men explain the history of their conflict with the Flap-jacks, saying that one of their men saw one and shot it thinking it was some sort of native game. After that, the Flap-jacks showed up at a farm and killed two cows. Since then, the two sides have been attacking each other back and forth.\n\nLemuel arrives and asks Retief who he is spying for as he pulls a weapon on him. Retief tells him to put the weapon up and then punches Lemuel quickly when he doesn\u2019t. Suddenly, they hear a noise; Retief throws a bucket of water on their fire, and they all dive for cover. Retief then announces he will go out by himself. \n\nAway from the camp, Retief sits and waits until a Flap-jack attacks him. He fights back and struggles but then manages to put his thumb in the creature\u2019s eye, which subdues it. Then he has the creature take him to its leader. In the Flap-jack\u2019s camp, Retief offers himself as a prisoner and is taken to the leader, who introduces himself as Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns. Retief introduces himself as Retief of the Mountain of Red Tape. The two have dinner as Hoshick explains the Flap-jacks' history with the settlers. They think the settlers are sportsmen who enjoy skirmishes, so every time the setters attack them, the Flap-jacks attack back. The Flap-jacks plan to bring in more equipment and skirmishers to match the settlers. Hoshick says he personally prefers a more limited skirmish without nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. \n\nRetief suggests eliminating the weapons and explains that the settlers only use them when they think they are fighting against lower life forms. In further discussion, he learns that the Flap-jacks are worried that the settlers want to take over the deserts they need to grow the lichens they use for their food and wine. The Flap-jacks have no use for the oases. Retief brokers a deal where the Flap-jacks get all the deserts, and the settlers get all the oases.\n\nRetief briefs Passwyn when he returns to Ivory but does not reveal that he never opened the envelope containing his orders.\n",
        "Summary_3": "A Vice-Consul named Retief is sent to the planet Adobe to settle a dispute between the human settlers there and an indigenous species called the Jaq. He is given a thick envelope of instructions by his superior, Consul Passwyn, who tells him to follow them to the letter with no improvisation. Passwyn makes it clear that he thinks it will take a miracle to pull this mission off, but still tells Retief that he expects results. \n\nRetief lands on Adobe under arduous circumstances, during which his pilot bails out of the plane, he narrowly misses an atomic fission weapon, and he is immediately shot at upon landing. The shooter turns out to be Potter, a human who mistook Retief for a Jaq (or, as the human settlers refer to them, a \u201cflap-jack\u201d). He now assumes that Retief is the cousin of someone called \u201cLemuel\u201d, and brings him back to the other humans without letting Retief clarify his real identity. \n\nThe other humans are glad to see him, thinking he\u2019s a reinforcement. They tell him that they\u2019ve been engaged in back-and-forth raids with the Flap-jacks, and also that they\u2019ve heard that a bureaucrat is coming to talk them out of the dispute. Lemuel enters and reveals that Retief is not his cousin. He asks Retief who he is spying for and threatens him, at which time Retief easily subdues him in 1-2 punches, much to the awe of the other humans.\n\nRetief senses something outside and insists on looking into it alone. He hides and waits for a Jaq to attack him, and he subdues it by gouging its eye. He asks to see its leader, and is brought to the Jaq headquarters to dine and meet with Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns. \n\nRetief and Hoshick eat and discuss how best to conduct next steps in the ongoing battle between the Jaq and the human settlers, of whom Hoshick seems to assume Retief is the leader. They discuss banning certain weapons, until Retief eventually gets Hoshick to agree to combat between the two of them. After discussing a few rules,  they commence to fight. Hoshick does well until Retief manages to gouge him until he goes limp. \n\nAfterward, Retief asks Hoshick if he would consider giving the human settlers the oases and vegetables on the planet if the humans would let the Jaq have all the desert areas. Hoshick likes the idea. \n\nRetief goes back to the human camp, gives them some wine and offers the same deal. They are equally happy to take the oases and give up the desert. \n\nWe then find Retief back with Consul Passwyn, who is shocked at the success of the mission. Passwyn, who never seems to give praise where it is actually due, says it\u2019s a good lesson about how things go when you follow instructions exactly. After Retief leaves the office, he tosses the envelope of instructions into the trash, still unopened. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Consul Passwyn meets with Vice-Consul Retief. Passwyn explains that Terrestrial settlers came to Adobe thinking it was uninhabited, but they started a war with the indigenous life form, the Flap-jacks. Passwyn hands Retief an envelope and tells him that he must handle the situation without any impromptu actions. \n\nThe mail pilot that is supposed to take Retief to Adobe refuses to do his job after he sees that there is a war going on. Retief pilots the skiff himself and crash lands on the planet. He gets out, enters a jungle-like habitat, and immediately looks for cover. A stocky man shoots at Retief, and Retief tackles him to the ground. The man, Potter, tells him that they\u2019ve been waiting for help from Ivory to come and battle the Flap-jacks. \n\nPotter takes Retief to meet with his comrades, and the men explain that the Flap-jacks have recently started using superior weaponry, and more Terrestrials have been killed. Lemuel walks up, butts in the men\u2019s conversation, points a gun at Retief, and accuses him of being a spy. Retief responds by punching Lemuel in the face and knocking him unconscious. The men hear a noise and get down on the ground. Retief tells the others that he\u2019s going to check it out by himself. \n\nRetief enters the desert of Flap-jack country. A Flap-jack attacks him, and in response he is able to wrap his arms around the alien and put his thumb into the creature\u2019s eye. The Flap-jack agrees to take Retief to his leader.\n\nAfter a short walk, Retief crawls on the ground to enter a cave. The leader, Hoshick of the Mosaic of the Two Dawns, congratulates Retief on being a worthy adversary. Hoshick uses a translating device to speak to Retief, and he offers the Terrestrial delicious food and several servings of tasty yellow wine. \n\nRetief asks Hoshick to consider getting rid of all weapons, and he suggests that this is the modern and polite way to fight. Weapons are reserved for vermin. He then goes one step further and asks Hoshick to keep the fight between the two of them. \n\nRetief and Hoshick go outside, remove their weapons, and engage in one-on-one combat. Retief remembers his trick and gouges Hoshick\u2019s eye. Retief wins, and Hoshick agrees to give the Terrestrials the sand that the Flap-jacks desperately want to harvest lichen for their wine. Retief offers to allow the Flap-jacks to keep the desert as long as the Terrestrials can have all of the oases and vegetable farming land. \n\nRetief returns to Potter, Lemuel, Swazey, and Bert. He has the men try the wine that Hoshick gifted to him and tells them about the deal he made. He hands the Treaty and the other important paperwork to Passwyn. Passwyn congratulates him on a job well done and by the book. Retief takes his original envelope of instructions and throws it in the incinerator. \n"

He picked up a pointer, indicating the\ninnermost planet.\n  \n \n  \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers\u2014a\nmere handful of them\u2014have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with\nan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq.

Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>Twenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears\u2014or no ears at all\u2014but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\nretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\nmouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\nthroats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\nout for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\nyell....\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\nonce.\"\n  \n \n  \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\nnarco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\nparade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\nwas no killing.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're alive?\"\n  \n \n  \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\n  \n \n  \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what\nfoods\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\n  \n \n  \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want\nmore information.

Absolutely, I assure you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\n  \n \n  \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...\nTerrestrials ... were unharmed.

No, no guns\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them;\nhelped them to death.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\n  \n \n  \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking\nfor them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a\nbrisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close\ncall, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the\nstrange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we\nfelt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships\ncame, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our\nguilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our\nfriendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made\na blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make\namends....\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is the ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with it?

You have some explaining to do. And I don't\nthink your story will be good enough.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you admit\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to\nit.\"\n  \n \n  Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.\n  \n \n  \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for\nyour diplomatic immunity, I should do more\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force\npaid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial\ndiplomatic mission.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.\n\"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It\nhas outdone itself\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief\nsaid. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you've\nvisaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the\ndiplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or\nyour satellite\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Enough!\" Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of\nthis matter\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to do\nthe talking,\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"You can't!\" Miss Meuhl gasped.\n  \n \n  Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The\nGroaci sat down.\n  \n \n  \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years\nback\u2014about nine, I think\u2014there was a little parade held here. Some\ncurious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged,\nthey were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the\nstreets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to\ncommunicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.\n  \n \n  \"Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the\nparade was over?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I wrote them for you. They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?\"\n  \n \n  \"Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man,\" Miss Meuhl said stiffly.\n\"He had complete confidence in me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on,\" Retief said, \"I won't\nbe so busy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"May I ask where you'll be if something comes\nup?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. \"Whatever for?\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. \"You've been here on Groac\nfor four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put\nthe present government in power?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure I haven't pried into\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser?

I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders\nraking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down\nthe fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one\noccasion.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\n  \n \n  \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,\ngrilling these innocent people as though they were criminals.

Just before the silence grew\nawkward, Magnan went on.\n  \n \n  \"There are four planets in the group,\" he said. \"Two double planets,\nall rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987.

Retief drew\ncarefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.\n  \n \n  \"This is open aggression, Retief,\" he said, \"in case I haven't made\nmyself clear.

        "Summary_1": "The Jaq are a flat, wide-bodied species with tentacles and a tender orifice at the center of their bodies where a human chest would normally be. They are led by Hoshick, who has a strong interest in mining the deserts of Adobe for a special lichen used to craft their yellow wine. This wine would then be sold to planets across the universe. The Jaq make their headquarters in the desert. In the scattered oases of Adobe, the Terrestrial settlers have built farms in the rich soil of the planet's surface. The Terrestrials refer to the Jaq as \"Flap-jacks\" due to their unique physicality. One day, a Terrestrial man mistakes a Jaq for one of Adobe's native species, and he shoots and kills it. This ignites a war between the two groups. The central Terrestrials featured in the story--Potter, Lemuel, Bert, and Swazey--require assistance from their allies on Ivory because they only have three hundred men and are unsure they can defeat the Jaq. When the Embassy sends Retief to serve as an intermediary, he discovers that the two groups have similar interests--they each only want control of their separate areas. By craftily suggesting the use of weapons is no longer fashionable, Retief neutralizes the Jaq artillery and is able to convince both groups to reach a peace treaty. And, as it turns out, the Terrestrial settlements no longer have wine, so the adjacent existence of Jaq wine fields would have a mutual benefit.",
        "Summary_2": "The Jaqs and the Terrestrials fight each other throughout the story. It started when a human saw a Jaq and thought it was some type of native game and shot it. From that incident, the Jaqs concluded that the humans were sportsmen like themselves and responded by going to one of the farms and killing two cows. Since then, the two sides have been attacking back and forth, and the humans think the Jaqs are fighting against them. Hoshick explains that he actually prefers the skirmishes to be without weapons. Until Retief meets with the Jaqs and talks with Hoshick, none of the humans had interacted with the Jaqs peacefully. The humans think the Jaqs want to take over all the oases, and the Jaqs think the humans want to take over all the deserts.",
        "Summary_3": "The Jaqs and Terrestrials are at odds with each other over territorial rights on Adobe, but they clearly know nothing about each other, nor what the other group actually wants. A Terrestrial set off the disagreement by shooting at a Jaq, and the Jaqs have apparently killed several cows thinking they are humans. The Jaqs also believe that they are giving the Terrestrials what they want because they consider them fellow \u201csportsmen\u201d, while the Terrestrials are actually dwindling in number and living in fear. While they continue raiding each other without talking, they fail to understand that different parts of the planet interest them, and they need not fight at all. By the end of the story, Retief has settled the dispute and both parties have been given the lands they desire; they now all happily reside on the planet together under the new agreement. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Terrestrials show up on Adobe thinking the land is uninhabited, but they quickly learn that the Flap-jacks are also there. One of the men shoots at an Adoban, and for three months, the Terrestrials engage in battle with the aliens. The Flap-jacks attack Swayzey\u2019s farm and kill two of his cows. The next time they showed up, Potter and Swazey shot at them. The men describe the aliens as dirty blankets. \n\nThe Flap-jacks begin using more advanced weaponry, like airships and automatic rifles. With their new technology, they are able to kill more Terrestrials. The men are very concerned about protecting their farmlands, and they believe the aliens want to take them. \n\nRetief is put in charge of mending the relationship between the Terrestrials and the Flap-jacks, so he goes to meet with their leader. He learns how to appropriately attack a Flap-jack when one of them charges at him when he enters their territory. The aliens are muscular and heavy with fringe-tentacles, and Retief is able to subdue the Flap-jack by gouging its eye with his thumb. \n\nThe Flap-jack\u2019s leader, Hoshick, is immediately cordial towards Retief. Hoshick must use a translating device to speak to him, but he is open to all kinds of suggestions from Retief. He has his waiter serve food and wine during their meeting, and he explains that once they figured out the Terrestrials were sportsmen, they wanted to up the ante and show them a good time with their advanced weaponry. In fact, Hoshick called in an additional hundred Adobans to make the fight more interesting. \n\nHoshick is quickly convinced that fighting with weapons is a lowly thing to do, and he agrees to fight Retief one-on-one. Hoshick loses the fight when Retief sticks his thumb in the alien\u2019s eye. Hoshick is willing to give the Terrestrials all of their land, but he admits that he\u2019s disappointed that he won\u2019t be able to continue farming lichens in the desert in order to make their delicious and profitable wine. \n\nRetief agrees that the Flap-jacks can keep the sand hills they need for harvesting lichens as long as the Terrestrials can have the oases and the farmlands. Essentially, the entire war was a miscommunication. Neither side wanted what the other had, but without a discussion about why each party was on Adobe, it was completely unclear to everyone that their motivations were dissimilar. \n"

If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet.

Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you.

Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred.

Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable.

The screen snapped aglow, and a wavering long-distance\nimage appeared.\n  \n \n  \"He's here now,\" Miss Meuhl said to the screen. She looked at Retief\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  \"That's good,\" Retief said. \"I don't think the Groaci can knock us off\nthe air, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I have done my duty, Mr. Retief,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"I made a full\nreport to Regional Headquarters last night, as soon as you left this\noffice. Any doubts I may have had as to the rightness of that decision\nhave been completely dispelled by what you've just told me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at her levelly. \"You've been a busy girl, Miss Meuhl. Did\nyou mention the six Terrestrials who were killed here?\"\n  \n \n  \"That had no bearing on the matter of your wild behavior! I must say,\nin all my years in the Corps, I've never encountered a personality less\nsuited to diplomatic work.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\ncovered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\nwith a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\ngray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\n  \n \n  \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\n  \n \n  The guard blinked at it.\n  \n \n  \"Whassat?\"\n  \n \n  \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\nsays he's out to lunch.\"\n  \n \n  The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\nagainst the handrail.\n  \n \n  \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\nright into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\nwent to his knees.\n  \n \n  \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\npast while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\nover the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\n  \n \n  A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\nalong the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\nThe door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\nfloor. It was expensive looking baggage.\n  \n \n  Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\nflorid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\nthe open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\nclamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\nhe backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\n  \n \n  \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\nout of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\n  \n \n  \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr.\nTony's room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\nsat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\nthe corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\noversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\nglanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n  \n \n  \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\nout?\"\n  \n \n  Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\nhandle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\nthe trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\nfar wall of the corridor and burst.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\nface of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, you must be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If you'll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\nthe door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins on the planet of Ivory, where Retief meets with his superior, Consul Passwyn. This seems to be the headquarters of the CDT, a kind of intergalactic governing body concerned with diplomatic efforts. The majority of the story's action takes place on the planet of Adobe. The planet is covered with vast deserts and spotted with several oases. The oases are like jungles with hot air, dense foliage, and dwarf trees along with a variety of wildlife from lizards to insects. They used to be sea-beds and therefore have rich soil for planting. The Terrestrials settlers live and built farms there. The Jaq built their headquarters in the midst of the deserts, where they prefer to stay for their rich resource of lichen used to produce wine. When Retief crash-lands on Adobe, he meets the Terrestrials in an oasis and eventually crosses over into the desert when he goes to consult with the leader of the Jaq, Hoshick. The Jaq headquarters is a comfort-dome with red lights, granite tables, fine silverware and glassware, pink walls, and a low-lying ceiling. Retief meets with Hoshick here and convinces him to engage in a skirmish. He then fights and defeats the leader outside the headquarters in the bright sand. After securing the deal, Retief returns to Ivory to report on the success of his mission.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins and ends on a planet called Ivory. It is the location of the CDT and the Embassy where Retief works. The rest of the story takes place on a planet called Adobe, which has a native life form that the Terrestrial settlers call Flap-jacks. Adobe has deserts and oases. The human settlers have farms on the oases where they raise crops and cattle to help feed the space system. The Flap-jacks live in the desert where they can grow the lichens that they use for food and wine. The temperature during the daytime is warm, and the oases support trees, animals, insects, and the humans living there. The oases are old sea-beds and have good, deep topsoil. The Flap-jacks live in a comfort-dome that has a low ceiling about five feet high. The walls are a pink-colored nacre, and the floor looks like burgundy glass and is covered with silk rugs.",
        "Summary_3": "The majority of the story takes place on the planet Adobe, which has multiple topographical and climate features including a humid jungle, temperate oases, and rolling deserts. Retief reaches the planet via an aircrafts, and once there he visits several locations. He visits the camp of the Terrestrials, outdoors around a fire, as well as the low-to-the-ground but comparatively lavish dwellings of the Jaqs. These are surrounded by thorned branches for protection, but the inside of the Jaq headquarters is adorned with fine textures and surfaces like granite, silk, silver, and rose-crystal. Retief also spends the beginning and end of the story back at his unspecified posting with his superior, which is apparently quite rural and rugged. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Adobe. The Terrestrials have recently started farming there, and the Flap-jacks are also farming, but they are using the sand hills to grow lichens to make wine. The Flap-jack\u2019s side is desert, and the Terrestrial\u2019s side is more of a jungle. There are dwarf trees, song lizards, and insects, as wells as foliage and bushes. \n\nThe Terrestrials are using the land to keep their cattle, and they also value the dozens of oases. The ponds are a mile deep with excellent topsoil. \n\nIn the desert portion of the land, the leader of the Flap-jacks holds court in a cave surrounded by thorn branches. The cave\u2019s ceiling is not very tall, and it is decorated with silk rugs, polished red granite, silver dishes, and rose-crystal drinking glasses. \n\nAdobe is a place that both Flap-jacks and Terrestrials can use to their advantage, and they have nothing to fight over because the resources they desire to not overlap at all.\n"

Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n<doc-sep>The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye\nand grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n  \n \n  \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous\nobserved. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\nto time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n  \n \n  Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked\nfor the dispatch clerk.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that\ncontingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT\ntransports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.\nHas it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n  \n \n  Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.\nBut there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed\nclear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and\ntake a look at that baggage for me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The\nlevel in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to\nthe phone.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.\nGuns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,\nI'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a\nfriend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you\nunderstand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that\nwill cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n  \n \n  Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down\nto the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  Karsh met Retief as he entered the Departures enclosure at the port.\n  \n \n  \"What's going on here?\" he demanded. \"There's some funny business with\nmy baggage consignment. They won't let me see it! I've got a feeling\nit's not being loaded.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd better hurry, Mr. Karsh,\" Retief said. \"You're scheduled to\nblast off in less than an hour. Are the students all loaded?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, blast you! What about my baggage? Those vessels aren't moving\nwithout it!\"\n  \n \n  \"No need to get so upset about a few toothbrushes, is there, Mr.\nKarsh?\" Retief said blandly. \"Still, if you're worried\u2014\" He turned to\nArapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"Hank, why don't you walk Mr. Karsh over to the warehouse and ...\nah ... take care of him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know just how to handle it,\" Arapoulous said.\n  \n \n  The dispatch clerk came up to Retief. \"I caught the tractor equipment,\"\nhe said. \"Funny kind of mistake, but it's okay now. They're being\noff-loaded at d'Land. I talked to the traffic controller there. He said\nthey weren't looking for any students.\"\n  \n \n  \"The labels got switched, Jim. The students go where the baggage was\nconsigned. Too bad about the mistake, but the Armaments Office will\nhave a man along in a little while to dispose of the guns. Keep an eye\nout for the luggage. No telling where it's gotten to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here!\" a hoarse voice yelled. Retief turned. A disheveled figure in a\ntight hat was crossing the enclosure, arms waving.\n  \n \n  \"Hi there, Mr. Gulver,\" Retief called. \"How's Boge's business coming\nalong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Piracy!\" Gulver blurted as he came up to Retief, puffing hard. \"You've\ngot a hand in this, I don't doubt! Where's that Magnan fellow?\"\n  \n \n  \"What seems to be the problem?\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"Hold those transports! I've just been notified that the baggage\nshipment has been impounded. I'll remind you, that shipment enjoys\ndiplomatic free entry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Who told you it was impounded?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind! I have my sources!\"\n  \n \n  Two tall men buttoned into gray tunics came up. \"Are you Mr. Retief of\nCDT?\" one said.\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about my baggage!\" Gulver cut in. \"And I'm warning you, if those\nships lift without\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"These gentlemen are from the Armaments Control Commission,\" Retief\nsaid. \"Would you like to come along and claim your baggage, Mr. Gulver?\"\n  \n \n  \"From where? I\u2014\" Gulver turned two shades redder about the ears.\n\"Armaments?\"\n  \n \n  \"The only shipment I've held up seems to be somebody's arsenal,\" Retief\nsaid. \"Now if you claim this is your baggage....\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, impossible,\" Gulver said in a strained voice. \"Armaments?\nRidiculous. There's been an error....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,\ncaught it as it popped up.\n  \n \n  \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You\nprobably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years\nback?\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two\nfresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,\nswallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.\nWe like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a\nforce. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than\nwe did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.\nBut it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\nbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n  \n \n  \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow\nmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\nexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\nyou're doing it for strangers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief\nsaid. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\nwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\nturn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\nseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\nFirst, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\ncovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\nhere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\ngrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\nto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on\nwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\nand it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\nthe tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\nroast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\nfruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\ndone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\nfor the best crews.\n  \n \n  \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\nfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\nget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\nborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\ntoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\nof grape juice?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Wine is the essential reason the Jaq came to Adobe in the first place. Their leader, Hoshick, envisioned sourcing its vast deserts for lichen. This lichen would then be used to produce a yellow wine that could be sold to planets all around the universe. When Retief first meets Hoshick, the Jaq leader provides him with a rose-crystal drinking-tube, from which they are able to sample this wine. Retief notes that the wine tastes delicious and smells good and reminds him of Chateau d'Yquem. This detail reveals the Jaq's interest in the finer things in life, in appearing distinguished. This interest is reflected in all of the Jaq's interactions with Retief, including his ability to be coerced into hand-to-hand combat because he deems it a more modern, sportsmanlike way of resolving issues. Wine again becomes important after Retief wins the fight and gets Hoshick to agree to the terms of his proposed land treaty with the Terrestrials. After Hoshick agrees, Retief attempts to convince the Terrestrials to agree as well. After learning of the lack of wine within their settlements, Retief lets the Terrestrials sample the wine provided to him by the Jaq. Eventually, the Terrestrials agree to the arrangement as well. Therefore, the wine is also a symbol of the newfound peace between the two previously warring groups.",
        "Summary_2": "The Jaqs make their own wine out of the lichens that they grow in the desert. The lichens will only grow in the desert, so the desert is extremely important to them. Their wine is of very high quality; in fact, Retief compares it to the wine from Chateau d\u2019Yquem. The wine helps Retief arrange the deal to divide the land between the settlers and Jaqs in a way that is favorable to both sides. The human settlers have not been able to produce wine; they believe that the bacteria required to make it won\u2019t grow on Yaq, so they have only been drinking stump water. Retief lets them try the Jaqs' wine, and they like it. This, along with the offer to give all of the deserts to the Jaqs and keep all of the oases for the humans, helps Retief work out the peace deal for the Jaqs and the settlers. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Wine is significant in the story because it symbolizes how little the Jaqs and the Terrestrials know about one another, and how they can live harmoniously. The Terrestrials believe that Adobe is lethal to the process of making alcohol and that wine can\u2019t be made. The Jaqs enjoy a sweet yellow wine made from lichens that they get from the desert. Retief settles the dispute with the Jaqs over wine, and then brings some with him to settle it with the Terrestrials, and both parties agree. The wine is a symbol of how their differing aims can complement each other and they can produce and trade different crops to benefit everyone. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Wine is an important part of the story because the Flap-jacks have only come to Adobe to make their wine. The leader of the Flap-jacks, Hoshick, explains that he brought his people to the planet to build his own Mosaic and till the sands to grow paradise-lichen. He hoped to make delicious and expensive wine with the crop and sell it all over the universe. \n\nRetief tries the wine during his conversation with Hoshick, and he compares the beverage to Chateau d'Yquem. When he takes some back to his men, they also find the wine to be wonderful. \n\nIf the Terrestrials had known in the beginning that the Flap-jacks were interested in harvesting the lichens in the sand, they never would have tried to engage in battle with them.\n"

The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears\u2014or no ears at all\u2014but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Magnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n  \n \n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n  \n \n  \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n  \n \n  \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n  \n \n  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief rose, went to the communicator, assisted Miss Meuhl aside.\n  \n \n  \"Listen carefully, Fith,\" he said. \"Your bluff has been called. You\ndon't come in and we don't come out. Your camouflage worked for nine\nyears, but it's all over now. I suggest you keep your heads and resist\nthe temptation to make matters worse than they are.\"\n  \n \n  \"Miss Meuhl,\" Fith said, \"a peace squad waits outside your consulate.\nIt is clear you are in the hands of a dangerous lunatic. As always, the\nGroaci wish only friendship with the Terrestrials, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother,\" Retief said. \"You know what was in those files I looked\nover this morning.\"\n  \n \n  Retief turned at a sound behind him. Miss Meuhl was at the door,\nreaching for the safe-lock release....\n  \n \n  \"Don't!\" Retief jumped\u2014too late.\n  \n \n  The door burst inward. A crowd of crested Groaci pressed into the room,\npushed Miss Meuhl back, aimed scatter guns at Retief. Police Chief\nShluh pushed forward.\n  \n \n  \"Attempt no violence, Terrestrial,\" he said. \"I cannot promise to\nrestrain my men.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're violating Terrestrial territory, Shluh,\" Retief said steadily.\n\"I suggest you move back out the same way you came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I invited them here,\" Miss Meuhl spoke up. \"They are here at my\nexpress wish.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are they? Are you sure you meant to go this far, Miss Meuhl? A squad\nof armed Groaci in the consulate?\"\n  \n \n  \"You are the consul, Miss Yolanda Meuhl,\" Shluh said. \"Would it not be\nbest if we removed this deranged person to a place of safety?\"\n  \n \n  \"You're making a serious mistake, Shluh,\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Miss Meuhl said. \"You're quite right, Mr. Shluh. Please escort\nMr. Retief to his quarters in this building\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't advise you to violate my diplomatic immunity, Fith,\" Retief\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"As chief of mission,\" Miss Meuhl said quickly, \"I hereby waive\nimmunity in the case of Mr. Retief.\"\n  \n \n  Shluh produced a hand recorder. \"Kindly repeat your statement, Madam,\nofficially,\" he said. \"I wish no question to arise later.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be a fool, woman,\" Retief said. \"Don't you see what you're\nletting yourself in for? This would be a hell of a good time for you to\nfigure out whose side you're on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm on the side of common decency!\"\n  \n \n  \"You've been taken in. These people are concealing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You think all women are fools, don't you, Mr. Retief?\" She turned to\nthe police chief and spoke into the microphone he held up.\n  \n \n  \"That's an illegal waiver,\" Retief said. \"I'm consul here, whatever\nrumors you've heard. This thing's coming out into the open, whatever\nyou do. Don't add violation of the Consulate to the list of Groacian\natrocities.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the man,\" Shluh said.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  by KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Retief knew the importance of sealed\n   \n  orders\u2014and the need to keep them that way!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"It's true,\" Consul Passwyn said, \"I requested assignment as principal\nofficer at a small post. But I had in mind one of those charming resort\nworlds, with only an occasional visa problem, or perhaps a distressed\nspaceman or two a year. Instead, I'm zoo-keeper to these confounded\nsettlers. And not for one world, mind you, but eight!\" He stared glumly\nat Vice-Consul Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Still,\" Retief said, \"it gives an opportunity to travel\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Travel!\" the consul barked. \"I hate travel. Here in this backwater\nsystem particularly\u2014\" He paused, blinked at Retief and cleared his\nthroat. \"Not that a bit of travel isn't an excellent thing for a\njunior officer. Marvelous experience.\"\n  \n \n  He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagram\nappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger disk\nrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating the\ninnermost planet.\n  \n \n  \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers\u2014a\nmere handful of them\u2014have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with\nan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq. I can't think why they\nbother, merely for a few oases among the endless deserts. However I\nhave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to\ntake certain action.\" He swung back to face Retief. \"I'm sending you\nin to handle the situation, Retief\u2014under sealed orders.\" He picked\nup a fat buff envelope. \"A pity they didn't see fit to order the\nTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.\nI'm expected to produce a miracle\u2014a rapprochement between Terrestrial\nand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure\nwould look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.\"\n  \n \n  He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,\" Retief said, \"until the\nTerrestrial settlers arrived.\"\n  \n \n  \"Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.\" Passwyn fixed Retief\nwith a watery eye. \"You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a\ndelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu\nelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at\nSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,\nyou'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less than\nan hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's this native life form like?\" Retief asked, getting to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"When you get back,\" said Passwyn, \"you tell me.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  CULTURAL EXCHANGE\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  It was a simple student exchange\u2014but\n   \n  Retief gave them more of\n   \n  an education than they expected!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Second Secretary Magnan took his green-lined cape and orange-feathered\nberet from the clothes tree. \"I'm off now, Retief,\" he said. \"I hope\nyou'll manage the administrative routine during my absence without any\nunfortunate incidents.\"\n  \n \n  \"That seems a modest enough hope,\" Retief said. \"I'll try to live up to\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't appreciate frivolity with reference to this Division,\" Magnan\nsaid testily. \"When I first came here, the Manpower Utilization\nDirectorate, Division of Libraries and Education was a shambles. I\nfancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the\nwisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two\nweeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n  \n \n  \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of\nweeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure\nto bear.\"\n  \n \n  \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even\nyou to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may\nbe the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more\ncultivated channels.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,\nglancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military\ncampaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of\nthe Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that\nprecedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Breaking and entering,\" Retief said. \"You may have something there.\nBut I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial\nworld of the poor but honest variety.\"\n  \n \n  \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"\nMagnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together.

Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n  \n \n  \"That\u2014bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk\nscreen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n  \n \n  \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"\nMagnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here\nat Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n  \n \n  \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's\nbutton.\n  \n \n  \"Send the bucolic person in.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV?

He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab\nshirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "After Retief takes command of the mail skiff, he narrowly misses colliding with a warhead that tracks his trajectory. Thanks to a swift maneuver, Retief is able to dodge its impact and crash-lands on Adobe. However, due to the red blip on his radar screen, Retief is now aware that one of the warring groups on the planet is using illegal fission weapons in battle. Initially, he believes the Terrestrials were responsible for this, but after meeting Potter, he realizes his mistake. Potter informs him the Terrestrials do not have weapons of that kind, so it has to be Jaq weaponry. This information becomes important later when Retief meets Hoshick for the first time. As the leader of the Jaq, Hoshick informs Retief that the skirmishes were a result of a desire to engage in more sportsmanlike conduct on the battlefield. Retief realizes he can use this desire to his advantage and pushes Hoshick to question whether or not weapons are required at all in resolving conflict. He pushes this idea further by suggesting his own kind would never solve problems with weapons, despite one of the Jaqs having been previously shot down by them. Retief excuses this by again playing into Hoshick's desire to appear more dignified and saying the shooting was a failure to recognize the Jaq as sportsmen. This tactic works, and he is able to use it to convince Hoshick to engage in hand-to-hand combat, which eventually leads to the resolution of the war.",
        "Summary_2": "The fission weapon is an indication of the intelligence and resources of the Jaqs, although at first, Retief doesn\u2019t know whose weapon it is. The fission weapon tracks the object it seeks and follows it. Retief is only able to avoid colliding with it by flying straight toward it at the last minute and passing it before it explodes. The leader of the Jaqs, Hoshick, says that he would prefer a contest without nuclear or radiation-effect weapons because it is such a bore having to screen the spawn for deviations afterward. Retief readily agrees that the humans will not use atomic weapons either for the same reason and because it wastes troops. This agreement is the first concession by the Jaqs and the humans about the fighting and is followed by other concessions that are advantageous to both sides.",
        "Summary_3": "The fission weapon is significant in the story for a few reasons. It nearly takes down the aircraft that Retief is flying to Adobe. He later finds out that the Jaqs have been using them in order to give the Terrestrials a good show of strength, and that their nuclear/radiation effect has spawned more creatures, such as the one that Retief briefly takes captive. The Terrestrials tell Retief that they don\u2019t have access to such weapons and that the Jaqs have been leveling up their weaponry; unbeknownst to them, the Jaqs have done so to try to compete with them. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The fission weapon is important because it almost kills Retief.\n\nRetief encounters the fission weapon when he is piloting the skiff alone towards Adobe. His original pilot refuses to transport him to the planet because he can see that there are missiles and other weapons in use. The pilot does not want to get killed, and he insists that Retief can die if that\u2019s what he wants to do.\n\nWhile Retief is flying towards Adobe, he sees a red blip show up on the screen of the skiff. Retief feels nervous and panicky because the red dot means that someone has deployed a warhead that emits heavy radiation, also known as a fission weapon. The fission weapon has been outlawed. He hopes that his skiff has not been spotted, and he changes course to avoid the warhead. When the missile comes within five miles of his vehicle, Retief decides to accelerate as fast as possible. He just makes it past the missile, and it explodes mid-air. The fission weapon makes Retief crash land on the planet. His skiff fills with smoke and his screen breaks. \n"

Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  MIGHTIEST QORN\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n   \n  held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot\nplatinum desk at his assembled staff.\n  \n \n  \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,\nlooking solemn.\n  \n \n  \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat\ntimes, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as\nthey had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused\nfor effect.\n  \n \n  \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n  \n \n  \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited\nTerrestrial territory....\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do\nnot share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder\nbefore him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n  \n \n  His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the\nGalactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the\npresence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor\nto advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the\nthirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,\nTerrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,\nand let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n  \n \n  Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n  \n \n  \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on\nthe surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested\nfrowns to settle into place.\n  \n \n  \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial\ncontrolled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments\nof the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n  \n \n  The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth\nslapped the table.\n  \n \n  \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every\nhypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the\nQornt fleets are indetectible!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless\ncountenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.\n\"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall\n   \n   and\n   \n  faces like that!\"\n  \n \n  The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout. How many of you are there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  The alien whistled shrilly.\n  \n \n  \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n  \n \n  \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n  \n \n  \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous\nstraits at the moment. I\n   \n   may\n   \n  fly into another rage, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small\nwhistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped\nthe beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it\nhappens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You certainly\n   \n   look\n   \n  like Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are\nsturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,\nthey do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n  \n \n  \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a\ncommon ancestor, perhaps.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation\nfor the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to\n   \n   their\n   \n  level.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador\nat Smorbrod?\" Retief asked.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine\nglass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like\nto fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as\nQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush\nthings?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of\ngovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n  \n \n  \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one\namong us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow\nhim.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest\ncommunity singing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would\nhappen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with\nthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\nThe Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize\ninto Verpp\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become\nwarmongers like Qorn?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old\nsaying goes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What\nabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to\nsit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing\noff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But\nwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you\nTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what\nyour strength was.\"\n  \n \n  \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've\nhad diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're\nQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if\nhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other\nCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is\ndefinitely on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could\nname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal\nhere....\"\n  \n \n \n  V\n  \n \n  At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retief\nand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDT\nSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,\nflying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" Magnan commented. \"I wonder what the significance of the\nwhite ensign might be?\"\n  \n \n  Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the\ninvasion\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol\nin one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at\nMagnan's chest.\n  \n \n  \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n  \n \n  \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy\nof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp\nhave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's\nanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now\nstep along, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief\nstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at\nthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,\nstaring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,\nfollowed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table\nfaded.\n  \n \n  Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped\nforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his\nchair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,\nmoving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to\nbear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy\nhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned\nface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz\nsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n  \n \n  Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n  \n \n  Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n  \n \n  \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n  \n \n  \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm convinced.\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\n  \n \n  A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n  \n \n  \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay\u2014and ship them back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n  \n \n  \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n  \n \n  \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\n   \n   like\n   \n  to fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n  \n \n  \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n  \n \n  \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n  \n \n  Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n  \n \n  \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Over my dead body!\"\n  \n \n  \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>An hour later, Nitworth, breathing freely again, glowered across his\ndesk at Retief and Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"This entire affair,\" he rumbled, \"has made me appear to be a fool!\"\n  \n \n  \"But we who are privileged to serve on your staff already know just how\nclever you are,\" Magnan burbled.\n  \n \n  Nitworth purpled. \"You're skirting insolence, Magnan,\" he roared. \"Why\nwas I not informed of the arrangements? What was I to assume at the\nsight of eighty-five war vessels over my headquarters, unannounced?\"\n  \n \n  \"We tried to get through, but our wavelengths\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah! Sterner souls than I would have quailed at the spectacle!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you were perfectly justified in panicking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I did\n   \n   not\n   \n  panic!\" Nitworth bellowed. \"I merely adjusted to the\napparent circumstances. Now, I'm of two minds as to the advisability of\nthis foreign legion idea of yours. Still, it may have merit. I believe\nthe wisest course would be to dispatch them on a long training cruise\nin an uninhabited sector of space\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The office windows rattled. \"What the devil!\" Nitworth turned, stared\nout at the ramp where a Qornt ship rose slowly on a column of pale blue\nlight. The vibration increased as a second ship lifted, then a third.\n  \n \n  Nitworth whirled on Magnan. \"What's this! Who ordered these recruits to\nembark without my permission?\"\n  \n \n  \"I took the liberty of giving them an errand to run, Mr. Secretary,\"\nRetief said. \"There was that little matter of the Groaci infiltrating\nthe Sirenian System. I sent the boys off to handle it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Call them back at once!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid that won't be possible. They're under orders to maintain\ntotal communications silence until completion of the mission.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth drummed his fingers on the desk top. Slowly, a thoughtful\nexpression dawned. He nodded.\n  \n \n  \"This may work out,\" he said. \"I\n   \n   should\n   \n  call them back, but since\nthe fleet is out of contact, I'm unable to do so, correct? Thus I can\nhardly be held responsible for any over-enthusiasm in chastising the\nGroaci.\"\n  \n \n  He closed one eye in a broad wink at Magnan. \"Very well, gentlemen,\nI'll overlook the irregularity this time. Magnan, see to it the\nSmorbrodian public are notified they can remain where they are. And\nby the way, did you by any chance discover the technique of the\nindetectable drive the Qornt use?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir. That is, yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well? Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any. The Qornt were there all the while. Underground.\"\n  \n \n  \"Underground? Doing what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hibernating\u2014for two hundred years at a stretch.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Ambassador Nitworth, the local head of the government for the Terrestrials, has received an ultimatum from a species called the Qornt. The Qornt want to take over the planet that the Terrestrials currently occupy. This is surprising because the whereabouts of the Qornt have been unknown for the past two centuries. The Ambassador orders Second Secretary Magnan to travel to Roolit I, the planet where the Qornt are now, to investigate the situation in person. Retief is sent to go with Magnan, with orders from the Ambassador to avoid Magnan from doing anything impulsive. When they arrive, Retief wants to investigate the situation on the surface, whereas Magnan would have been happy to take one look and return to his office. As Retief is insisting on taking a look, the two men are spotted by two eight-foot-tall creatures and a skirmish starts. After Retief pulls Magnan from the fight, and some bickering takes place, the men learn that these two creatures are Verpp, not Qornt. They ask if they know about the Ultimatum sent to the Ambassador\u2014the men call the outer planet Smorbrod, but those on Roolit I call it Guzzum. Zubb and Slun (the Verpp) say that they aren\u2019t caught up on political matters, so they don\u2019t have anything to say about the upcoming invasion, but they do give the men information about where they are. Tarroon is the town they are closest to, where there are 15-20 Qornt, and Zubb and Slun say that the Qornt would mostly ignore Terrestrials, which makes Retief think they should walk right in. Magnan is afraid of a trap, but they head into the underground Qornt village. Once they make it to Qornt Hall, the group walks through a tunnel into a huge room with high ceilings, where the walls are plastered with weapons and other spoils of battle. It was a trap: the Verpp walk the men into the dining hall where the Qornt are having a feast, hoping that the Qornt would be mad at the men for interfering with the Verpp. It turns out the Qornt are even larger than the Verpp (twelve feet tall), and Qorn (the lead Qornt) is insistent that there will be no peace, because he is hungry for battle, so he ties up the men. Retief threatens them saying the Terrestrials intended to use Roolit I to test a bomb, and breaks out of his chains in the chaos\u2014the differences in gravity between the planets means that the men are very strong, even if they are much smaller than the Verpp and Qornt. Retief ties up Qorn and declares himself the new leader. The Qornt explain that Verpp molt into Qornt after a few other stages of metamorphosis, and that the Qornt are very driven by a need for battle. Upon return to the outer planet, we learn that Retief has supposedly recruited the Qornt for the Peace Enforcement Corps, and sends them out to battle, circumventing Nitworth\u2019s authority. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\tAmbassador Nitworth of the Terrestrials receives an undetectable message from the Qornt. This communication states that they will soon invade the CDT and pillage the surrounding area in 30 days time. The Qornt are known for their warlike tendencies and battle-hardy population, but they disappeared without a trace around 200 years ago. Despite their sudden reappearance on Terrestrial territory, the Terrestrials caught no sight of them on their Navigational Monitor Service. \n\tThe Ambassador and his military decide to evacuate their land, an incredible feat thanks to their 15 million Terrestrials. They give themselves one day to plan their move, before announcing it to the general population. \n\tMagnan, one of the Ambassador's men, is ordered to explore Roolit and find the Qorn. Magnan, though hesitant, is forced to accept and take Retief with him. As they explore, they come across two Verpp, Zubb and Slun. After a quick battle, Magnan and Retief win and speak to the Verpp as their captives. Their race is a peaceful one, focused on exploring nature and other species. \n\tZubb and Slun escort them to the Qornt den, where they are feasting. Slun leaves them outside of Qornt Hall, located in Tarroon.  Zubb guides them into the grand chamber, where the Qornt are in the midst of their weeks-long feast. The bejeweled hall features Qornt of different sizes and statuses. Qorn, the chief, is seated above them all in a headdress and plumage. Zubb explains that each Qornt has their own fully-automated dreadnought, AKA warship. \n\tAfter hearing about their weaponry and seeing the Qornt in all their beastly glory, Magnan decides to retreat. Zubb, however, betrays them and pulls out two guns. He announces their arrival after forcing the Terrestrials in. Qorn belches in response. The Qornt chain the two Terrestrials. \n\tThe chief boasts about what the Qornt will do to the Terrestrials and squanders Magnan\u2019s hopes for surrender or peace. However, the other Qornt are not in agreement. They seem fairly nonchalant about the matter. They understand that this is their duty as Qornt, but they also would rather feast and boast than fight. \n\tRetief claims that the Terrestrials will use Tarroon as a target for their new hell bomb. He delivers his own ultimatum to the Qornt, breaking the chains around his wrists. Taroon\u2019s gravity and atmosphere lighten the weight, hence Retief\u2019s ability to break the chains. Retief challenges Qorn to a battle, despite Qorn\u2019s greater size and stature. \n\tRetief wins, ties Qorn up, and names himself their new leader. The Qornt still plan on invading the Terrestrials, however, and Retief must find a solution. It\u2019s revealed that the Verpp transforms into the Qornt like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly. They reach a solution, however. The Qornt become the new task force for the Peace Enforcement Corps. The Verpp establish their own Consul in the city. Ambassador Nitworth is pleased with this turn of events, and the Qornt are sent on a mission right away.",
        "Summary_3": "A diplomatic corps of humans (Terrestrials) receives an ultimatum from the Qornt warlike alien race telling them to evacuate a planet or be destroyed. The alien race appeared suddenly and undetected by the humans. Two men, Mangan and Retief, are dispatched to the alien planet to investigate while an evacuation plan can be developed.\n\nMangan and Retief come upon two aliens who they mistake for Qornt but are actually Verpp. They are able to capture them and they lead the men to the Qornt community. Once their their captives turn on them and capture the men, binding them in chains.\n\nThe Qornt leader is uninterested in diplomatic discussions and is intent on invading the human planet. At this point Retief breaks his bonds which are only weak aluminum and defeats the Qornt leader in physical combat. Retief convinces the remaining Qornt to abandon the invasion plan and elect himself as their leader.\n\nWhen the human ambassador returns to discuss the evacuation, Mangan and Retief inform him that the Qornt have remarkably been folded into the Terrestrial Peace Corps and have been sent out on mission. Retief and Mangan will now be in charge of recruitment of Alien races into the human community.",
        "Summary_4": "Ambassador Nitworth appears in front of his staff to announce that the Qornt, a race that disappeared 200 years ago, has suddenly reappeared and is making demands. One of the most alarming facts about this assault is that the Qornt were able to appear on the planet without detection by any of the equipment the earth men use. \n\nWhen Magnan tries to sneak out of the meeting without an assignment, Nitworth sends him and Ratief to check out the Qornt in person. Within moments of their arrival at the site, a Qornt steps out of the bushes. Magnan immediately tries to escape, but another alien appears and the two Qornts stop him from running away. He is able to defend himself and knocks them both to the ground. \n\nThe aliens agree to take Magnan and Ratief to Qornt Hall to speak with Qorn, the leader. Once they reach the hall, the Qornt escorts pull out a couple of weapons and point them at Magnan. They want to tell Qorn that the two men have assaulted them and tried to kidnap them. Inside the meeting place, the wild-looking leader tells Ratief and Magnan that he has zero intention of negotiating a peace deal between the Qornts and the humans. Instead, he wants adventure and action. \n\nIt becomes clear that Qorn is forcing his men to go to war although some of them are not interested in the battle. Qorn argues that he is the ultimate leader, and it makes no difference if his subordinates agree with his decisions or not. \n\nRatief and Magnan were sent to the Qornts to negotiate the earth men's surrender, but Ratief completely changes the plan. He tells the leader that they want to deliver an ultimatum of their own. They will bomb the planet in a few days\u2019 time, regardless of whether the Qornts have left it or not. \n\nQorn insists that his troops are ready for war, but one of his subordinates cuts in to tell him that many of the other Qornts would prefer to feast and enjoy themselves without going to battle for no good reason. Ratief challenges Qorn to a fight, and he eventually gets the alien in a stranglehold. After Ratief wins, he claims himself leader of the Qornts. \n\nSeveral of the Qornts declare that they must go to war regardless of who their leader is. They were made for fighting even though they didn\u2019t like their past leader\u2019s decision to attack the earthmen. Magnan suggests that the group goes elsewhere to invade, and Ratief agrees.  \n\nAmbassador Nitworth shows up to save Ratief and Magnan, completely unaware that they have taken over the Qornts. The men explain to their boss that they have established the Foreign Brigade, and the Qornts will now work for them. They have been sent off on a far away mission. Ratief and Magnan also tell Nitworth that the Qornts never left the planet. They were hibernating underground for 200 years.\n"

        "Query": "In \"Mightiest Qorn,\" how does the relationship between Magnan and Retief develop throughout the story?",
        "Article": "Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys.

I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan.

Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course.

Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine\nglass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like\nto fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as\nQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush\nthings?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of\ngovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n  \n \n  \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one\namong us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow\nhim.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest\ncommunity singing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would\nhappen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with\nthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\nThe Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize\ninto Verpp\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become\nwarmongers like Qorn?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old\nsaying goes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What\nabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to\nsit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing\noff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But\nwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you\nTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what\nyour strength was.\"\n  \n \n  \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've\nhad diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're\nQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if\nhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other\nCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is\ndefinitely on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could\nname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal\nhere....\"\n  \n \n \n  V\n  \n \n  At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retief\nand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDT\nSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,\nflying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" Magnan commented. \"I wonder what the significance of the\nwhite ensign might be?\"\n  \n \n  Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the\ninvasion\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Outside in the corridor, Magnan came up to Retief, who stood talking to\na tall man in a pilot's coverall.\n  \n \n  \"I'll be tied up, sending through full details on my\u2014our\u2014your\nrecruiting theme, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Suppose you run into the city\nto assist the new Verpp Consul in settling in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that, Mr. Magnan. Anything else?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan raised his eyebrows. \"You're remarkably compliant today, Retief.\nI'll arrange transportation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother, Mr. Magnan. Cy here will run me over. He was the pilot\nwho ferried us over to Roolit I, you recall.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be with you as soon as I pack a few phone numbers, Retief,\" the\npilot said. He moved off. Magnan followed him with a disapproving eye.\n\"An uncouth sort, I fancied. I trust you're not consorting with his\nkind socially.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't say that, exactly,\" Retief said. \"We just want to go over a\nfew figures together.\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless\ncountenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.\n\"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall\n   \n   and\n   \n  faces like that!\"\n  \n \n  The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout. How many of you are there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  The alien whistled shrilly.\n  \n \n  \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n  \n \n  \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n  \n \n  \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous\nstraits at the moment. I\n   \n   may\n   \n  fly into another rage, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small\nwhistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped\nthe beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it\nhappens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You certainly\n   \n   look\n   \n  like Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are\nsturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,\nthey do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n  \n \n  \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a\ncommon ancestor, perhaps.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation\nfor the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to\n   \n   their\n   \n  level.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador\nat Smorbrod?\" Retief asked.\n  \n<doc-sep>Magnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please\u2014never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n  \n \n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters\u2014such as working with\nYouth groups\u2014would create a far better impression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n  \n \n  \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n  \n \n  \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n  \n \n  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm convinced.\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\n  \n \n  A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n  \n \n  \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay\u2014and ship them back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n  \n \n  \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n  \n \n  \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\n   \n   like\n   \n  to fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n  \n \n  \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n  \n \n  \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n  \n \n  Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n  \n \n  \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Over my dead body!\"\n  \n \n  \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol\nin one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at\nMagnan's chest.\n  \n \n  \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n  \n \n  \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy\nof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp\nhave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's\nanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now\nstep along, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief\nstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at\nthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,\nstaring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,\nfollowed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table\nfaded.\n  \n \n  Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped\nforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his\nchair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,\nmoving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to\nbear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy\nhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned\nface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz\nsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n  \n \n  Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n  \n \n  Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n  \n \n  \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n  \n \n  \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Magnan and Retief are the men selected to go to the planet where the Qornt are based in order to investigate. Although Magnan was the first person assigned to the job, he is less comfortable out in the field compared to Retief, who ends up making most of the decisions. There is a tension here as they continue their adventure, with Magnan being scared and Retief encouraging him forward, and Retief saving Magnan when he is pinned by the Verpp. Magnan is the one who is explicitly a diplomat, but Retief takes over most conversations\u2014not only does he push the mission forward and insist on following the Verpp to the Qornt, but he eventually declares himself leader of the Qornt. Even when Ambassador Nitworth demands information from Magnan near the end, it is Retief who responds\u2014he wants the Ambassador to know that he is the one calling the shots, even if it has been behind the scenes. It\u2019s clear that Magnan has either not understood this, as if he were being tricked, or he is just not good at giving credit where credit is due, because he refers to the plan as his own recruiting scheme, correcting himself to say it was a group effort, even though it was all Retief\u2019s idea. At the very end of the story, Retief complies to all of Magnan\u2019s requests in an uncharacteristic way\u2014the interpretation is left open, but there is a possibility Retief is hiding something and intends to return as a military leader with the Qornt and perhaps attack the Terrestrials. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\tMagnan is a hesitant man, very aware of himself. His anxiety about the situation at hand is in direct relation to his self-preservation instincts. Retief, on the other hand, is far bolder, willing to sacrifice himself and his safety to explore, solve the issue, or reach a solution. At first, Retief makes fun of Magnan and his hesitancy. Often, Retief has to goad or tease Magnan just to make him come along with him. \n\tAfter Magnan takes down both the Verpps, Retief\u2019s respect for him grows, if only incrementally. Their sarcastic and snarky manner only grows as the story progresses. As they continue on their mission, Magnan continues to question Retief\u2019s ever-present bravery, but this only propels him forward. \n\tOnce Retief challenges Qorn to a duel, Magnan instantly tries to hold him back and questions his train of thought. After hearing Retief\u2019s plan, Magnan backs off and watches his comrade take down the chief. \n\tNow that Retief is their new leader, he and Magnan brainstorm with the Qornt about how to solve the issue at hand. Magnan always leads with the idea of peace, while Retief looks for other solutions. \n\tAlthough they experience some difficulties in the beginning, Magnan and Retief develop a friendly relationship where they are able to question each other, keep the other one safe, and bounce ideas off of each other.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Mangan and Retief begin their adventure on the planet at odds with each other. Mangan is in favor of leaving the planet while Retief proposing investigating further the more they learn. Mangan is diplomatic and risk-averse in his interaction while Retief prefers action.\n\nRetief is the cleverer of the two men and understands that although the Verpp and Qornt look imposing, the lower gravity on the planet renders them ineffectual physically. He uses this knowledge to his advantage to defeat Qorn, the leader of the Qornt and bluff the remainder of the population into establishing himself as their leader. Mangan, originally the leader of the expedition falls into line behind Retief's lead. By the end of the story Retief has accomplished a striking victory and now is beginning to view Mangan as another clueless dignitary like Nitworth and begins to discuss his future plans with the lower-class pilot, Cy.",
        "Summary_4": "Magnan and Ratief are sent to investigate the Qornt together. Before they leave, Ambassador Nitworth tells Ratief to make sure that Magnan does not do anything foolish or compulsive. \n\nHowever, as soon as they land on the planet, Magnan accuses Ratief of going against the boss\u2019s policies. Ratief tells Magnan to give him an hour to investigate the Qornts and to leave without him if he\u2019s not back in time. Ratief is clearly the braver of the two men. Yet, Magnan is able to show off his own skills and courage when the Qornts show up unexpectedly and jump out from behind a bush. Magnan knocks the aliens down without much thought. \n\nMagnan tries to convince Ratief to go back to their ship, but Ratief refuses and instead says that it\u2019s their job to go get the Qornts\u2019 attention. Although the two Qornts agree to bring them to their leader, Magnan is concerned that the Qornts are secretly plotting an attack against the diplomats. His doubts about their kindness have merit. The two Qornt escorts end up pulling out weapons and threatening the men. This time, it\u2019s Ratief who uses caution and tells Magnan not to scare the Qornts because they may get nervous and shoot. \n\nRatief takes charge of the mission and leaves Magnan\u2019s opinions about the situation out when he tells the Qorn that the two earthmen have come with an ultimatum. He completely changes his boss\u2019s message and tries to scare the Qornts into leaving. When the leader refuses, Ratief challenges him to a duel and comes out victorious. Ratief then nominates himself to be the new leader of the group.\n\nMagnan is stunned by Ratief\u2019s cavalier attitude, but he is supportive of his colleague. He trusts Ratief to make good decisions, even when his actions seem outlandish. \n"

The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ...

The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P.

He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  MIGHTIEST QORN\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n   \n  held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot\nplatinum desk at his assembled staff.\n  \n \n  \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,\nlooking solemn.\n  \n \n  \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat\ntimes, perhaps two hundred years ago.

Eight feet tall\n   \n   and\n   \n  faces like that!\"\n  \n \n  The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout.

I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape.

Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the\nfeasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word\nwith him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from\nthe other Centers as well.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of\nthing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually\nidentical, except for the personal touches each individual has given\nhis ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as\nthough these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set\nof toy sailboats!\"\n  \n \n  Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can\nsee that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n  \n \n  \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll\nkindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer\nthe matter to committee.\"\n  \n \n  \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss\nhaving a cosy chat.\"\n  \n \n  There was a pause.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most\ncompelling argument....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm convinced.\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\n  \n \n  A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n  \n \n  \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay\u2014and ship them back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n  \n \n  \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n  \n \n  \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\n   \n   like\n   \n  to fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n  \n \n  \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n  \n \n  \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n  \n \n  Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n  \n \n  \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Over my dead body!\"\n  \n \n  \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't\ntry conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive\nof our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the\nConfidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a\ncouple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be\nworked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will\nbe a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,\nwell rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any\nrecommendation?\"\n  \n \n  The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a\nstiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n  \n \n  \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,\ndignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military\nAttache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of\naction is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population\nof over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the\nPolitical Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk\nby oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.\nHarried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan\neased toward the door.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n  \n \n  \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It\nwas a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to\nlet us know how it works out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of\nchores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field\nexperience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these\nQornt personally.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my\nhead and do something rash if I go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.\nNo dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the\ntransport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n  \n \n  Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any\ndirection.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope\nof towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among\nflamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of\nwhite beach with the blue sea beyond.\n  \n \n  \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we\ncouldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why\ndon't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can\nobserve.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to\nthink of sightseeing.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're\nquestioning Corps policy!\"\n  \n \n  \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it\nmight be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm\nnot back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n  \n \n  \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan\nclutched at his arm.\n  \n \n  There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy\nbranch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,\ngreen-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like\nsteps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set\namong bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed\nas the creature cocked its head, listening.\n  \n \n  Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed\ndirectly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of\na giant trunk.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps\ninto the brush.\n  \n \n  A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,\ndarted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its\nnarrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,\nturned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the\nright. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n  \n \n  Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and\nstopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n  \n \n  \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of\nthem.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Second Secretary Magnan was selected by Ambassador Nitworth to travel to Roolit I to investigate the Qornt. Magnan does not have much field experience and is surprised by this assignment, and had been trying to get out of doing anything related to the Qornt issue when it was handed to him. He resigns himself to the task and Retief is assigned to go along with him. When they get to the planet, Magnan is clearly anxious\u2014he remarks on the quality of the view and states his intent to head back to finish the mission, but Retief doesn\u2019t let him give up so early. When the men are spotted by some creatures, and he tries to run for help, he is instead jumped by the creatures and Retief has to tear him free. This gives Magnan some confidence, and has a much more arrogant attitude towards the Verpp. He flaunts his title as diplomat and tries to assert as much dominance as he can. Once he learns that these are Verpp and not Qornt, he is preoccupied by the confusing details of the story: how many Qornt there are, and things like that. Once the group starts towards the Qornt\u2019s village, however, he becomes nervous again, no longer with the upper hand. He is not sure if he is walking into a trap, and becomes more and more nervous until the trap is revealed. Once at gunpoint standing in front of the Qornt, however, he has enough confidence to pry at the division between the Qornt who want war and those who aren\u2019t sold on the idea yet. Once Retief threatens the Qornt and a fight commences, Magnan still tries to talk his way out of Zubb shooting the men, gains confidence again, and insists on taking the guns. Once Qorn has been tied up, Magnan suggests putting the Verpp in charge, and asks the Qornt if there are alternatives to militaristic life that they would consider. Eventually they all make it back to where the story started, and he seems more passive again, until the Ambassador is on board with Retief\u2019s plan, and Magnan starts ordering Retief around again, though Retief\u2019s behavior has shifted in response. ",
        "Summary_2": "\tMagnan is one of Ambassador Nitworth\u2019s men, assumedly part of his military brigade. When Nitworth commands him to take Retief on a journey to find the Qornt, he balks and asks not to. He is essentially the literary version of a scaredy-cat. \n\tThroughout their journey, Retief has to come up with different encouragements or tricks to keep Magnan going, usually involving putting him in harm\u2019s way. At first, Magnan\u2019s self-preservation is what drives him forward. But as the story progresses, he soon grows to care for Retief in a purely platonic way. This development means he also tries to protect Retief in his own way, usually by questioning his choices and insisting safety comes first. \n\tAt the end, Magnan becomes a much braver man and negotiates with the Qornt himself. He constantly pushes for the idea of peace, not only for his own self-preservation but also for those around him. His basic instincts remain, but they expand to include the rest of the Terrestrials as well as the other races.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Mangan is the Second Secretary in the Terrestrial Diplomatic Corp. He answers to Ambassador Nitworth. He is chosen to perform reconnaissance on the alien planet along with Retief. Initially, Mangan is a by-the-books officer with something of a cowardly streak not wanting to engage in any risky action. Throughout his time on the planet, Mangan is continually proposing that they retreat before being pushed on by Retief.\n\nEventually when Mangan is nearly captured by the Verpp, he physically overpowers them. Eventually, Mangan is influenced by Retief's bravado and guile and aids him in deceiving the Qorn into joining the Terrestrial military complex.\n\nMangan also has a prejudiced view of social class (not unlike the Verpp) disapproving of Retief socializing with a mere pilot. This limitation prevents Mangan from seeing the bigger picture of the situation unlike Retief.",
        "Summary_4": "At the beginning of the story, Magnan, the diplomat, takes on very little responsibility. He listens to Nitworth\u2019s declarations about an unknown enemy invading their territory, and he is unphased. He tells Nitworth that it seems like everything is under control, so he is just going to head out. Nitworth sends him to check on the Qornt in person, and he is deeply unhappy with the assignment.\n\nUpon arrival, Magnan immediately tries to get out of doing any work by telling Ratief that they can\u2019t locate the group. He doesn\u2019t see it as his responsibility to save the earth men from the invaders. \n\nHowever, when the Qornts appear in front of him, he wastes no time in defending himself and his colleague and knocks them to the ground. After spending more time with the Qornts and getting to know them and their society better, Magnan becomes more invested in what happens to them and how the earth men handle their invasion. He fully supports Ratief when he asks Qorn to prove that he is in fact the strongest and again when Ratief claims the leadership role for himself. Magnan knows that everything Ratief is doing is against Nitworth\u2019s orders, but he trusts Ratief to make good decisions, and the whole ordeal is very entertaining. \n"

Now, about the\ninvasion\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the\nfeasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word\nwith him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from\nthe other Centers as well.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of\nthing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually\nidentical, except for the personal touches each individual has given\nhis ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as\nthough these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set\nof toy sailboats!\"\n  \n \n  Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can\nsee that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n  \n \n  \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll\nkindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer\nthe matter to committee.\"\n  \n \n  \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss\nhaving a cosy chat.\"\n  \n \n  There was a pause.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most\ncompelling argument....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless\ncountenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.\n\"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall\n   \n   and\n   \n  faces like that!\"\n  \n \n  The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout. How many of you are there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  The alien whistled shrilly.\n  \n \n  \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n  \n \n  \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n  \n \n  \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous\nstraits at the moment. I\n   \n   may\n   \n  fly into another rage, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small\nwhistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped\nthe beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it\nhappens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You certainly\n   \n   look\n   \n  like Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are\nsturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,\nthey do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n  \n \n  \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a\ncommon ancestor, perhaps.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation\nfor the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to\n   \n   their\n   \n  level.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador\nat Smorbrod?\" Retief asked.\n  \n<doc-sep>Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  MIGHTIEST QORN\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n   \n  held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot\nplatinum desk at his assembled staff.\n  \n \n  \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,\nlooking solemn.\n  \n \n  \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat\ntimes, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as\nthey had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused\nfor effect.\n  \n \n  \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n  \n \n  \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited\nTerrestrial territory....\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do\nnot share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder\nbefore him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n  \n \n  His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the\nGalactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the\npresence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor\nto advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the\nthirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,\nTerrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,\nand let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n  \n \n  Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n  \n \n  \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on\nthe surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested\nfrowns to settle into place.\n  \n \n  \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial\ncontrolled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments\nof the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n  \n \n  The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth\nslapped the table.\n  \n \n  \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every\nhypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the\nQornt fleets are indetectible!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm convinced.\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\n  \n \n  A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n  \n \n  \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay\u2014and ship them back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n  \n \n  \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n  \n \n  \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\n   \n   like\n   \n  to fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n  \n \n  \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n  \n \n  \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n  \n \n  Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n  \n \n  \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Over my dead body!\"\n  \n \n  \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol\nin one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at\nMagnan's chest.\n  \n \n  \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n  \n \n  \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy\nof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp\nhave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's\nanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now\nstep along, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief\nstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at\nthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,\nstaring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,\nfollowed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table\nfaded.\n  \n \n  Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped\nforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his\nchair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,\nmoving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to\nbear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy\nhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned\nface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz\nsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n  \n \n  Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n  \n \n  Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n  \n \n  \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n  \n \n  \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Because they Qornt have been underground for two centuries while they molted from the Verpp stage of their life cycle, they have gone undetected by the Terrestrials in this time. This led the Terrestrials to believe that the Qornt possessed superior technology of some kind, as they seemed to have reappeared out of nowhere. However, this is not the case, and it was merely that the group remained dormant for a long time. There are rumors of stealth technology and superior ships, including a superdrive, but not much firsthand information until Magnan and Retief make it to the surface of Roolit I, the planet that the Qornt are currently occupying. It is true that the Verpp and Qornt are physically larger than the Terrestrials, but the systems of gravity on the different planets means that the smaller Terrestrials are actually stronger and have a kind of advantage on Roolit I. The Verpp tell Magnan that the Qornt have huge, powerful warships that have a variety of weapon types. Not only this, but each Qornt has his own ship, which means that there is a large fleet of these. It comes to Magnan as a surprise, then, that the Qornt are not worried about diplomatic negotiation, but instead just seem to have an impulse that drives them to be in battle. ",
        "Summary_2": "\tWhen the Qornt reappears after a 200-year hiatus, Ambassador Nitworth and his men are terrified because their radars are unable to find them. Because of this, and the Qornt\u2019s leader\u2019s claim about their unrivaled weaponry, the men are sure of their demise. They gather their forces to come up with five different relocation plans and decide to execute the best one in 24 short hours. \n\tWith a population of 15 million Terrestrials, relocation is a mighty feat. By choosing relocation, it\u2019s clear that Ambassador Nitworth and his men have no faith in their fleet\u2019s ability against the Qornt\u2019s. \n\tLater on, when Retief and Magnan are with the Zubb and the Qornt, we discover that each Qornt has his own dreadnought. Zubb talks them up as well, explaining in detail about these fully automated warships. He also mentions their super drive and their unstoppable army. However, Retief is smart enough to figure out that since they\u2019ve been underground for 200 years, they wouldn\u2019t have access to all of this new technology. The Qornt are still a warring species, though, advanced technology or not. \n\tSince the leader and his men were not in line, their power fell dramatically. Retief was able to become their new leader with relative ease. He also appeases their warlike ways by assigning them to the Peace Enforcement Corps.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The men are convinced of Qornt superiority due to the fact that they appeared on the planet undetected by their instruments. Later, Mangan and Retief learn that the Qornt command a massive armada of warships that would be a imposing threat to the Terrestrials.\n\nThe military mindset of the Terrestrials is similarly aggressive as the Qornt. They are intent on countering the perceived threat but seeing that they are facing a technologically superior foe, they seek to surrender and save their population.",
        "Summary_4": "The humans\u2019 tools are unable to detect the Qornts\u2019 invasion at the beginning of the story, so they assume that they have far more advanced equipment. It is obvious that they have never before seen an arrival go completely undetected by their tools. At the end of the story, however, the truth that the Qornts were hibernating underground for 200 years comes to light. Therefore, the earth men did not \u201cmiss\u201d their invasion, they just didn\u2019t know that there were dozens of them buried underground. \n\nThe Qornts are self-proclaimed lovers of war. The original Qorn says that he has no desire for peace between his people and the earthlings because he much prefers adventure and action, regardless of the potential loss of life. Although some of his subordinates do not agree with his decision to battle the earth men, they do acknowledge that war is an essential part of the Qornts\u2019 society. \n\nThe Qornts are not always Qornts. Before they are Qornts, they are Verpp, and before that they are Rheuk, and before that, Boog, etc. No one survives the Qornt stage because the Qornt love military life. \n"

The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief.

Now, about the\ninvasion\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is.

The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the\nfeasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies.

What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of\nthing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course.

I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all.

A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan.

Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war.

I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless\ncountenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.\n\"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall\n   \n   and\n   \n  faces like that!\"\n  \n \n  The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout. How many of you are there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  The alien whistled shrilly.\n  \n \n  \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n  \n \n  \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n  \n \n  \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous\nstraits at the moment. I\n   \n   may\n   \n  fly into another rage, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, restrain yourself.

A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a\ncommon ancestor, perhaps.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation\nfor the finer things of life.

This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level.

Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated.

Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys.

        "Summary_1": "The Qornt is a race of aliens known for their militaristic tendencies that seemed to disappear two centuries ago. They are of particular issue because they have reappeared and written to the Terrestrials saying they would take over the planet that the Terrestrials are on. We eventually learn that the Qornt are but one stage in a longer life cycle, in which Gwil become Boog, who become Rheuk, who become Verpp, who eventually become Qornt after the two hundred year estivation period. It is only in this stage that they become antagonistic and warlike, but they do not know what happens after this stage because Qornt are expected to die in battle, and none have survived long enough to know what happens. The Qornt themselves are twelve feet tall and troll-like, with very bushy fur, huge eyes, and beaks. They are very comfortable with their militaristic traditions\u2014when we meet them, they are in the midst of a large feast that they partake in before going to war. They boast the spoils of battle on display in their great hall, and wear intricate headdresses to show their power. After a skirmish with the men on Roolit I, in which Qorn (the lead Qornt) is replaced in power by Retief, they eventually make it to the outer planets where they have presumably been recruited into the Peace Enforcement Corps.\n",
        "Summary_2": "\tThe Qornt are a large, bird-like, warring species with scary beaks and large eyes. They are similar in looks to the Verpp but much larger and scarier. \n\tAs it turns out, the Qornt and several other species undergo a sort of metamorphosis, similar to a caterpillar becoming a butterfly in our reality. Just as the caterpillar burrows itself in a cocoon, the Verpp burrow, molt, and then re-emerge as Qornt. However, the Verpp aren\u2019t born. They are initially of the Gwil species. The Gwil transform into the Boog, which then transform into the Rheuk, and then they become the Verpp. \n\tSadly, it\u2019s unknown what the Qornt might become during their transformation. No Qornt has ever survived long enough to experience the next metamorphosis if there is one. They always die in battle, supposedly to make room for the Verpp to burrow again. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Qornt are an antagonistic alien race that have been rediscovered on the planet of Roolit I. They are a warlike race and have delivered an ultimatum to the Terrestrial inhabitants of Smorbrod that if they do not evacuate, they will invade. They are physically imposing, standing over 10 feet tall with a birdlike appearance.\n\nIn reality the Qornt are related to all of the other alien races on Roolit I. Each seperate race is a developmental stage of a single species. The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, which become Verpp which eventually become Qornt. The Qornt are predisposed to warlike tendencies so that they tend to die off and complete their life cycle in order to make room for new Qornt that develop from the Verpp. If they did not do this overpopulation would become an issue when they need to hibernate underground for 200 years. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Qornt originally lived in the Concordiate times, about 200 years ago. They vanished suddenly, and no historians know where it was that they went. However, Magnan and Ratief learn from the aliens that they were simply hibernating for two centuries. They never actually left the planet. \n\nThe Qornt are led by His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of the Qornt, Over-Lord of the Galactic Destiny. They are about eight feet tall, stand on two green legs, and move like birds. They have bushy green hair and white beaks. They love to attack other species and engage in dangerous action and war. \n\nQornt is the final stage in a long line of evolution of the being. The two beings that Magnan and Ratief meet are not actually Qornts, but Verpps. They are actually offended that the earth men mistake them for Qornts because they believe the similar but different creatures are argumentative and lowly. They are all \u201cpud\u2019s creatures,\u201d but they view themselves distinctly based on their place in the evolution of the being. No one survives the Qornt stage because they are always  engaging in war. \n"

The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too.

They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have.

It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  The Beast-Jewel of Mars\n  \n \n  By V.

Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n  \n \n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Oui.\n   \n  \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\nkeep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\n   \n   n'est-ce-pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are spacemen?\"\n  \n \n  Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\n   \n   Ich danke, senor.\n   \n  You\nknow why city is called Hoover City?\"\n  \n \n  Ben didn't answer.\n  \n \n  \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\nthousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ai-yee\n   \n  , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n  \n \n  He needed help.\n  \n \n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n  \n \n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  The Snare\n  \n \n  By RICHARD R.

The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story opens with Rodney, Martin and Wass landing on a foreign planet and overlooking an abandoned metal city where the inhabitants supposedly died more than a million years ago. They had thirteen hours to explore before they must return to their mother ship.\nThey notice a metal rim at the perimeter of the city that they must step over to enter, and continue in to explore. Wass must return to their \u201clifeboat\u201d spaceship to get a camera, but is unable to exit the city as the metal band they noticed coming in has turned into a dome-shaped shield over the entire city. They suspect it may be a radiation shield, and are suspicious that the wind they saw when landing and their inability to contact their home ship may indicate a tragedy took place as they arrived. \nThey find a control center of sorts with lots of knobs and levers, but do not engage with it for fear of not knowing what might happen. They all find the city somewhat familiar, but have no idea why. \nThey begin looking for where the water of the city comes from, since they may be able to find a way out of the city through its transport corridors. They all begin to start frightening each other with stories and seeing dust and objects move around in the dark. Rodney and Martin enter an underground tunnel through a hatch in the ground and Wass chooses not to follow them and instead leaves to return to the switchboard.\nAs Rodney and Martin discover a grate in the tunnel it begins to open for them. Wass delivers the message on the radio that he was able to do that from the control room, and then something attacks and kills him. Rodney and Martin escape to the outside of the dome to where others from their crew have come to their rescue. It is unclear whether Rodney and Martin ultimately live after they exit the tunnel.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin, Rodney, and Wass are the 11th expedition to arrive on this planet. However, with only 13 hours left before they need to depart, they are the first to discover the city tucked away on an island. They make their way to the malignant-looking, black buildings and step over a metal band to enter. They explore the city briefly, taking turns guessing at who lived here before and what everything meant. Martin asks for pictures, but Wass says he left the camera back in the lifeboat. He leaves to go retrieve it, while Martin and Rodney keep exploring. The buildings are surprisingly small and the doorways only reach their shoulders. Wass radios in to say that their is no exit, because a force field has sprung up around the city. They try and think of ways to escape, but they\u2019re not left with many options. They throw around the idea of an anti-radiation screen to protect the inhabitants. They decide to meet in the center of the city and explore one of the buildings to see if they can find an escape. \nAs they step in, they are all shocked at the interior architecture, which resembles a beehive. Rodney finds a switchboard, which they all fight over. Rodney and Wass want to try some switches and see if it will aid them in their escape, but Martin doesn\u2019t want to take such a big risk seeing as they still had eleven hours. They all pull their guns on each other, but the situation deescalates and they continue on their way. They travel down a ramp until they reach a flat wall. The dome was a force field on top, and then continued down with a metal surface. They went back up to the switchboard, until Wass stopped them. A glass case filled with seeds was to their left. They looked through it, but Martin stopped the boys from taking any out. Finally, at the switchboard with their weapons out, Martin tries to stop them from making any rash decisions as they still had nine hours. Rodney gets upset and impulsively flicks a switch. Martin tackles him before any more harm can be done. Wass realizes that there are water reservoirs under the city.  \nThey travel down again until they reach a hatch. It lifts up, and a coil slithers out. They quickly shut it, until Martin reasons that it\u2019s just dust. So he opens it again, and dust emerges. They throw down a rope with a flashlight and Martin heads down. Rodney follows after him, landing in the dust. Wass does not, however, and shuts the hatch above them. He thinks he will survive by the switchboard, not in the tunnels. Martin and Rodney travel for a few hours before reaching a closed grate. Wass laughs at them (only two hours left) and starts flicking switches. The grate suddenly opens, and they hear his screams. He is killed, but his sacrifice allowed the others to live. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Three men--Martin, Wass, and Rodney--are part of the crew of the eleventh inter-planetary expedition sent to explore a planet close to their own. Previous expeditions had not been able to locate the city said to be on the planet, but this crew has been successful where others have failed. The three men pilot a lifeboat to investigate the empty, metal city and only have thirteen hours to photograph and catalogue what they discover there before it will be too late to safely return to their planet. As they observe the city from a distance, they witness a large, dark cloud of wind and dust approaching the city. Approaching the city's borders, they discuss it is surrounded by a metal band, and in fact the entire city is made entirely of metal. Everything is a bit mysterious and even feels familiar to Martin. Who lived here? How did they see when it was dark outside? Did they crawl or walk? Were they a distant relative of their own species and experienced different evolutions? The men think about these things as they make their way through the city. Wass realizes he has forgotten his camera to take pictures and begins to muse that the city has a mind of its own. When he goes to retrieve his camera, the metal band bordering the town has unleashed a kind of force field, preventing Wass from leaving and effectively imprisoning the team. They wonder about the purpose of the wall--was it a defense mechanism against radiation used during some kind of war? The force field also prevents communication with their main ship, so they decide to make their way down into the city's depths to look for a way to escape. Once inside, they examine their surroundings and notice the architecture is the same smooth metal that formed the surface buildings and are arranged in a series of arches and corridors resembling a beehive. Rodney discovers a switchboard, which leads Martin to believe the whole city is some kind of machine or engine. After struggling to find a way out, Wass discovers a bank of glass cases filled with seeds. They return to the switchboard, and Rodney wants to flip one of the switches, since time is running out, but Martin punches him down to stop him. Then Martin to theorize there must be a water reservoir nearby. They move further into the depths and discover a hatch, inside of which is a sea of dust. Rodney and Martin follow the sea to a metal grate exit, but Wass stays behind. He flips a switch and is killed, but the metal grate opens and Rodney and Martin are freed.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on a planet in the same star system as Earth, where the crew of the thirteenth flight to the planet is exploring. There are three scout ships, and the story focuses on one, with the crew of Rodney, Martin, and Wass. They see what they think is the only city on the planet, never before discussed by other crews, and approach it to investigate. They are struck by its darkness, both in the lack of light as well as the dark metal that makes up most of the structures. They notice a metal band that surrounds the city, and step over it to continue onward. When Wass turns back to find the camera he left behind, he realizes he's trapped, and that the metal band turned into something akin to a glass wall. They can no longer contact their ship and need a way out. They figure their best bet is to go towards the center of the city and make their way down, in case they can dig out. They head down a magnificent ramp, dwarfed by the grand architecture of the city, and come across what looks like a switchboard. Martin threatens Rodney when he tried to reach for the switchboard and forces the group to keep walking, hoping that if the force-field is a dome that covers the top of the city, they might be able to find a way out by going under it. They are baffled by the huge structures in the city that seem to be supporting themselves, unsure of how the city keeps itself up. They eventually find the end of the city where all they see is a blank wall, so they head back towards the switchboard. Through all of this, Martin is seeing glimpses of familiarity in the city that he can't place. They find glass cases of seeds, which Martin warns Wass not to disturb - it's possible that these plants had grown outside the city at one point and they did not know what to expect if they were released. Rodney flips a random switch, which makes Martin tackle him, and they head to look for a water source or reservoir, continuing further downwards. Rodney finds a large metal disk with a wheel next to it, and Martin opens up the hatch. The group sees that whatever was inside is moving, shut the door out of fear, and eventually open it back up to take a closer look. A tentacle made of what looks like sparkling light particles swirls up into the area the men were standing in, and Martin and Rodney climb down the hatch, wading through the deep dust at the bottom, with Wass refusing to follow. Martin and Rodney eventually find an escape hatch, but they have to rely on Wass to open it for them from the switchboard. Wass dies screaming at whatever had broken glass behind him, and Martin and Rodney are rescued by the rest of their crew. "

        "Article": "Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\n  \n \n  Wass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now,\nand glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a\nglass wall.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving,\ntoward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.\n  \n \n  The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.\n  \n \n  \"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must\nbe all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences\nof this. Then\u2014\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we\nseparated.\"\n  \n \n  Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic\nthrough the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused\nthis?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of\nthe planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\n  \n \n  Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well,\nalien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\n  \n \n  Wass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for\nhundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\n  \n \n  Wass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're\nboth wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at\nMartin. \"The wind\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood\nstraighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\n  \n \n  They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,\nand stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\n  \n \n  Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n  \n \n  \"The shield?\"\n  \n \n  Wass nodded. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we\nmight\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to\ncover the city.\"\n  \n \n  Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n  \n \n  \"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We\nmay have to....\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Rodney prompted.\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\n  \n \n  He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall\nbuildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and\nplain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately\nfollowing his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the\ncorridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and\nthe streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into\neither side of the corridor.\n  \n \n  It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\n  \n \n  Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted\ndownward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\n  \n \n  A call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It\nlooks like a switchboard.\"\n  \n \n  The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a\ngreat arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had\ncome to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining\nthrough the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick\nrope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal\nroof.\n  \n \n  \"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make\nassumptions ever since we got here.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\n  \n \n  Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned. \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the\nswitch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\n  \n \n  He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n  \n \n  \"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n  \n \n  \"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Then, more quietly\u2014\"We still have eleven hours to find a way\nout.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the\ntime it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow\nit, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\nAnd Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"You too, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  \"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\n  \n \n  Martin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always\nthinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us\nthat much less time to find a way out. Martin\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you\nstand!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>After a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember\nthe wind? Air currents are moving it.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.\nThen\u2014\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\"\n  \n \n  Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,\notherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun\nloosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\"\n  \n \n  Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney\nand he, too, had drawn his gun.\n  \n \n  The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,\noutlined in the light of two torches.\n  \n \n  For a little while he was alone.\n  \n \n  Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014a\ntenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about\nMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,\nobscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange\nobjects.\n  \n \n \n \n  Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering\nspirals.\n  \n \n  Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said\nnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and\nnow, himself.\n  \n \n  \"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance.\n  \n \n  \"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered.\n  \n \n  Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a\ntorch swinging wildly on the end of it.\n  \n \n  The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently\nrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.\n  \n \n  Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip\nof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the\nswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?\"\n  \n \n  Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him\ndisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into\nthe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom\nof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He\nstamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing\njump. He sank no farther than his knees.\n  \n \n  He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest\nedge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long\nas we avoid the drifts.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and\nsank into the dust.\n  \n \n  \"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way,\nI'll go mine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wass!\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.\n  \n \n  The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied\nand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were\nhard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.\n  \n \n  \"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Martin growled.\n  \n \n  There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.\nThe two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously\nplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times\nwithout number.\n  \n \n  Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours,\nMartin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\"\n  \n \n  Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his\nthroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,\nhis flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.\n  \n \n  A grate.\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"Wass!\" he shouted. \"We've found a way out!\"\n  \n \n  Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. \"I'm at the switchboard now,\nMartin. I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.\n  \n \n  The grate groaned upward and stopped.\n  \n \n  Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he\nbegan to scream.\n  \n \n  Martin switched off his radio, sick.\n  \n \n  He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.\n\"Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been trying to get you,\" Rodney said, frantically. \"Why didn't\nyou answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"We couldn't do anything for him.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's face was white and drawn. \"But he did this for us.\"\n  \n \n  \"So he did,\" Martin said, very quietly.\n  \n \n  Rodney said nothing.\n  \n \n  Then Martin said, \"Did you listen until the end?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded, jerkily. \"He pulled three more switches. I couldn't\nunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place like\nthis\u2014!\"\n  \n \n  Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up\ntoward the surface. \"Come on, Rodney. Last lap.\"\n  \n \n  An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the\nedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force\nshimmering, almost invisible, about it.\n  \n \n  Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.\nMartin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members\nstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,\" someone said. It\nwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all\nhave guns, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited.\n  \n \n  After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,\n\"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out\nof here, then!\"\n  \n \n  Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the\nmetal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a\nhalt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must\nbe at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around\nthe city would take years.\"\n  \n \n  Martin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level\nleading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\"\n  \n \n  Wass laughed rudely.\n  \n \n  \"Have you a better idea?\"\n  \n \n  Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That\nleads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for\nthe dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean\n   \n   dig\n   \n  out?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no\nequipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\"\n  \n \n  Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in\nto themselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\"\n  \n \n  \"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added.\n  \n \n  Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.\nThe incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet\nperhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,\ngleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the\ndarkness before the men.\n  \n \n  At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.\n  \n \n  Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.\nMetal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down\non them.\n  \n \n  Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in\na circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up\nthere?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with\nhis light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my\nnightmares stay when they're not on shift.\"\n  \n \n  Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he\nthought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him\nsilently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more\nso by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the\nthree lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,\npast something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another\nsomething which could have been anything at all.\n  \n \n  The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.\n  \n \n  The edge of the city\u2014the city which was a dome of force above and a\nbowl of metal below.\n  \n \n  After a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\"\n  \n \n  \"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was\nholding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But\nRodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then\u2014\"I can't think of\nanything else.\"\n  \n \n  They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past\nthe same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all\nlooking different now in the new angles of illumination.\n  \n \n  Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,\nmatchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty\ntriumph in the rear.\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he\nsighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at\nsurface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and\nthen when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for\nnow. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.\nBut\u2014The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd\never explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and\nMartin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at\nsome point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a\nsort of racial insanity.\n  \n \n  No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.\nViewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,\na faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien\nmetal, which was making him theorize so wildly.\n  \n \n  Then Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\"\n  \n \n  Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding\nup the procession?\"\n  \n \n  Martin was silent.\n  \n \n  Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It\nwas in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before\na bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as\nthe combined light of their torches would reach.\n  \n \n  \"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.\n  \n \n  Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.\n  \n \n  Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section\nof the bank.\n  \n \n  Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they\nwouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\"\n  \n \n  Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  They were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\"\n  \n \n  \"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by\nthe deadline we may be eating these.\"\n  \n \n  Martin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us\nfind a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no\nwater.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the\ngun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For\na plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.\nMaybe\u2014\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with\nsuper-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"\u2014only the\nlittle moisture in the atmosphere.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  \"SIT DOWN, Ish,\" the Flight Surgeon said.\n  \n \n \n   They always begin that way\n   \n  , Isherwood thought. The standard medical\nopening. Sit down. What for? Did somebody really believe that anything\nhe might hear would make him faint? He smiled with as much expression as\nhe ever did, and chose a comfortable chair, rolling the white cylinder\nof a cigarette between his fingers. He glanced at his watch. Fourteen\nhours, thirty-six minutes, and four days to go.\n  \n \n  \"How's it?\" the FS asked.\n  \n \n  Ish grinned and shrugged. \"All right.\" But he didn't usually grin. The\nrealization disquieted him a little.\n  \n \n  \"Think you'll make it?\"\n  \n \n  Deliberately, rather than automatically, he fell back into his usual\nresponse-pattern. \"Don't know. That's what I'm being paid to find out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-\n   \n   huh\n   \n  .\" The FS tapped the eraser of his pencil against his teeth.\n\"Look\u2014you want to talk to a man for a while?\"\n  \n \n  \"What man?\" It didn't really matter. He had a feeling that anything he\nsaid or did now would have a bearing, somehow, on the trip. If they\nwanted him to do something for them, he was bloody well going to do it.\n  \n \n  \"Fellow named MacKenzie. Big gun in the head-thumping racket.\" The\nFlight Surgeon was trying to be as casual as he could. \"Air Force\ninsisted on it, as a matter of fact,\" he said. \"Can't really blame them.\nAfter all, it's\n   \n   their\n   \n  beast.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't want any hole-heads denting it up on them, huh?\" Ish lit the\ncigarette and flipped his lighter shut with a snap of the lid. \"Sure.\nBring him on.\"\n  \n \n  The FS smiled. \"Good. He's\u2014uh\u2014he's in the next room. Okay to ask him\nin right now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure.\" Something flickered in Isherwood's eyes. Amusement at the Flight\nSurgeon's discomfort was part of it. Worry was some of the rest.\n  \n \n \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

THIESSEN\n  \n \n  The city was strange, fantastic, beautiful.\n   \n  He'd never been there before, yet already he\n   \n  was a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  He lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an\nodd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n  \n \n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Oui.\n   \n  \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\nkeep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\n   \n   n'est-ce-pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are spacemen?\"\n  \n \n  Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\n   \n   Ich danke, senor.\n   \n  You\nknow why city is called Hoover City?\"\n  \n \n  Ben didn't answer.\n  \n \n  \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\nthousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ai-yee\n   \n  , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n  \n \n  He needed help.\n  \n \n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n  \n \n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\n   \n \n",

Wass, Martin, and Rodney all try and figure out a way to get out, who these aliens were, and what they\u2019re going to do, but quickly their relationship begins to deteriorate. Wass and Rodney turn against Martin fairly quickly, as they are so desperate to escape that they aren\u2019t willing to further explore all options. \nWass meets Martin and Rodney in the center of the city before travelling into one of the buildings. They find a switchboard there, which he is in favor of messing with, but Martin persuades him otherwise. Wass continually points his weapon at Martin and forces him to perfom dangerous tasks first. He discovers the seed bank, which Martin cautions the rest of the crew not to touch. When Rodney and Martin land in the tunnels, Wass shuts the hatch above them and runs back to the switchboard. He taunts them with the time and how many hours left. He believes he will escape by flicking switches on the switchboard, and that Rodney and Martin will die in the tunnels. However, his flicking switches actually brought about Rodney and Martin\u2019s rescue, as the grate that they were stuck at opened. Wass dies after flicking three or four of the switches and his screams reverberate throughout their radio. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Not long after the three men enter the metal city, Wass senses that something is amiss. Something about the city's architecture reminds him of his nightmares and makes him feel uneasy. He worries they are trapped for good and will miss their return flight when a force field surrounding the city prevents him from returning to the lifeboat to fetch his camera. Wass also appears to be very curious about the nature and physical attributes of the species that populated the city prior to their disappearance. He believes they must have been shorter due to the small stature of the buildings. Over time, he begins to show signs that he might believe the city and planet are in some way alive and have a will of their own. Perhaps it is this will that caused Wass to forget his camera. He is also very invested in mysterious geometric patterns they discover during their wanderings through the depths of the city, and he becomes extremely excited when he discovers a bank of glass cases which hold some kind of seeds. Wass wants to open them, but Martin warns him against this. The seeds might be some kind of plant or perhaps the offspring of the species that retired there. Whatever the case, Martin insists they attempt to find a water reservoir because it will likely lead to their escape. Wass refuses to follow them in, and instead stays behind to flip the switch that opens the grate that allows Martin and Rodney to escape. Wass is killed in a mysterious fashion.  ",
        "Summary_4": "Wass is one of the three men in his scout ship, a subset of the larger crew he is on a mission with. He is a slight blonde man with a large nose, and is in charge of the camera equipment in their group. He wanders into the city with Martin and Rodney, and when he realizes he left the camera behind, he is also faced with a new problem: there seems to be a glass barrier trapping him and his crewmates in the old city. He shouts into his radio to update the others, and they begin to brainstorm. The three of them travel through much of the city and some of the buildings trying to find a way out, and they eventually find a large hatch that Martin and Rodney jump into. Wass refuses to join, staying on top of the hatch, but once Rodney and Martin find a way out they realize the exit is covered in a metal grate. Wass had made it to the switchboard by then, and flips four switches which open the exit for Rodney and Martin to leave, but he screams into the radio after he starts this. Whatever it was with him must have killed him, but thanks to Wass, his crewmates made it out of the city alive to be rescued by the rest of the ship. "

        "Query": "Where is the abandoned metal city located in the story \"DUST UNTO DUST\"?",
        "Article": "  DUST UNTO DUST\n  \n \n  By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\n  \n \n  The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n  \n \n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave!\"\n  \n \n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n  \n \n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\n  \n \n  Wass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now,\nand glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a\nglass wall.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving,\ntoward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.\n  \n \n  The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.\n  \n \n  \"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must\nbe all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences\nof this. Then\u2014\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we\nseparated.\"\n  \n \n  Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic\nthrough the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused\nthis?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of\nthe planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\n  \n \n  Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well,\nalien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\n  \n \n  Wass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for\nhundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\n  \n \n  Wass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're\nboth wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at\nMartin. \"The wind\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood\nstraighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\n  \n \n  They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,\nand stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\n  \n \n  Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n  \n \n  \"The shield?\"\n  \n \n  Wass nodded. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we\nmight\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to\ncover the city.\"\n  \n \n  Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n  \n \n  \"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We\nmay have to....\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Rodney prompted.\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\n  \n \n  He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall\nbuildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and\nplain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately\nfollowing his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the\ncorridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and\nthe streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into\neither side of the corridor.\n  \n \n  It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\n  \n \n  Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted\ndownward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\n  \n \n  A call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It\nlooks like a switchboard.\"\n  \n \n  The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a\ngreat arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had\ncome to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining\nthrough the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick\nrope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal\nroof.\n  \n \n  \"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make\nassumptions ever since we got here.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\n  \n \n  Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned. \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the\nswitch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\n  \n \n  He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n  \n \n  \"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n  \n \n  \"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Then, more quietly\u2014\"We still have eleven hours to find a way\nout.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the\ntime it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow\nit, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\nAnd Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"You too, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  \"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\n  \n \n  Martin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always\nthinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us\nthat much less time to find a way out. Martin\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you\nstand!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Verana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\n  \n \n  Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\n   \n   Who\n   \n  are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n  \n \n  \"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n  \n \n  \"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n  \n \n  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n<doc-sep>My eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What happened?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Before we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\n  \n \n  The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\n  \n \n  The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\n  \n \n  Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n  \n \n  \"Miller!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\n  \n \n  I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\n  \n \n  Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n  \n \n  \"Miller, get help!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\n  \n \n  I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\n  \n \n  Static grated against my ear drums.\n  \n \n \n   Static!\n   \n \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  THE SERPENT RIVER\n  \n \n  By Don Wilcox\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Other Worlds May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say it any way you want to.

Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere?

They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\n  \n \n  Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\n  \n \n  The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on the surface of a planet that has an abandoned city made of metal. The city is spooky and the inhabitants supposedly died over a million years ago. However, they see things moving strangely while they are in the city suggesting it is inhabited, and something kills Wass within the city during the story.\nThey explore the metal streets of the city, a room with a large switchboard, and seven levels underground. Rodney and Martin explore an underground tunnel that eventually leads them out of the city and to the safety of their fellow crew. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Dust Unto Dust by Lyman D. Hinckley takes place on an island that had been previously explored. The ten previous groups never discovered the dull, black city on the island, but the eleventh did. This is presumably the only city on this planet that had not been inhabited for more than a million years. Only small mosses grew on the planet. \nThis city is made of insidious, black metal with similar architectural designs to modern earth. However, everything is shorter, presumably to make up for the inhabitant\u2019s shortened size. The character theorize that this city was under attack at one point, which would explain the anti-radiantion screen or force field that surrounds the entire city. Dull black streets twist and turn throughout the city and buildings rise up above them. \nOne of the buildings was designed almost like a beehive, many openings and arches and ways to escape. There were shetlers built underneath the city, again another sign of war. Beneath the shelters lay a series of tunnels that could have been used to bring water into the city. Now they are simply filled with dust. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on an unnamed planet close to the home planet of the story\u2019s three main characters. Martin, Rodney, and Wass are part of the crew on the eleventh inter-planetary expedition that seeks to discover the mysteries of the unnamed metal city. The planet is covered with mostly barren earth that leads up to the black city. A large cloud of dust blows over the city, which is protected by a kind of force field after the protagonists enter. The city is entirely constructed with smooth, black metal; Wass notes how low the buildings are, which might indicate the size of the species that previously lived there. When the protagonists decide to go underneath the city to find a way to escape, they discover several levels of interlocking arches and corridors that resemble a massive beehive. The men travel between levels using a number of ramps, and when they arrive at the bottommost level, they discover a subterranean level filled with a knee-high, flowing current of sparkling dust. Rodney and Martin follow the current to a metal grate, which leads to the surface outside the city.",
        "Summary_4": "This story takes place on a planet that is in the same star system as Earth, where thirteen different exploratory missions have visited. The humans had not realized that there was a city on the planet, from previous missions, but there is a lone city that one of the scout ships encounters on this thirteenth mission. There is a lot of sand and dust with some wind in the planet's terrain in general, and the city sticks out as being constructed of large metal structures. Everything in the city is at a very large scale: the man traverse wide ramps that they find under tall arches, and inside of buildings the halls and rooms seem endless. It is even more frightening in that the city is shrouded in darkness because of the metal streets, and the travelers wonder how much scarier it would be in the wintertime when there wasn't natural light. The city has a large metal ring surrounding it that the men are able to walk over to enter the city, but after they do this a large force-field of sorts is triggered and the ring transforms into the base of this protective barrier. Whatever this barrier's original purpose is, it has the effect of keeping the humans from leaving the city and blocks out the wind. Much of the story happens in the lower levels of the city, passing a switchboard and a seed bank and eventually ending up in a reservoir that held the pipe that the surviving men escaped through."

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between Rodney, Martin, and Wass in the story \"Dust Unto Dust\" and how does it change when they become trapped under the dome?",
        "Article": "Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all\nhave guns, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited.\n  \n \n  After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,\n\"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out\nof here, then!\"\n  \n \n  Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the\nmetal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a\nhalt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must\nbe at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around\nthe city would take years.\"\n  \n \n  Martin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level\nleading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\"\n  \n \n  Wass laughed rudely.\n  \n \n  \"Have you a better idea?\"\n  \n \n  Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That\nleads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for\nthe dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean\n   \n   dig\n   \n  out?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no\nequipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\"\n  \n \n  Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in\nto themselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\"\n  \n \n  \"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added.\n  \n \n  Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.\nThe incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet\nperhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,\ngleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the\ndarkness before the men.\n  \n \n  At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.\n  \n \n  Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.\nMetal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down\non them.\n  \n \n  Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in\na circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up\nthere?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with\nhis light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my\nnightmares stay when they're not on shift.\"\n  \n \n  Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he\nthought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him\nsilently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more\nso by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the\nthree lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,\npast something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another\nsomething which could have been anything at all.\n  \n \n  The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.\n  \n \n  The edge of the city\u2014the city which was a dome of force above and a\nbowl of metal below.\n  \n \n  After a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\"\n  \n \n  \"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was\nholding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But\nRodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then\u2014\"I can't think of\nanything else.\"\n  \n \n  They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past\nthe same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all\nlooking different now in the new angles of illumination.\n  \n \n  Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,\nmatchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty\ntriumph in the rear.\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he\nsighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at\nsurface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and\nthen when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for\nnow. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.\nBut\u2014The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd\never explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and\nMartin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at\nsome point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a\nsort of racial insanity.\n  \n \n  No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.\nViewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,\na faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien\nmetal, which was making him theorize so wildly.\n  \n \n  Then Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\"\n  \n \n  Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding\nup the procession?\"\n  \n \n  Martin was silent.\n  \n \n  Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It\nwas in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before\na bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as\nthe combined light of their torches would reach.\n  \n \n  \"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.\n  \n \n  Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.\n  \n \n  Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section\nof the bank.\n  \n \n  Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they\nwouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\"\n  \n \n  Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  They were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\"\n  \n \n  \"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by\nthe deadline we may be eating these.\"\n  \n \n  Martin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us\nfind a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no\nwater.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the\ngun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For\na plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.\nMaybe\u2014\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with\nsuper-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"\u2014only the\nlittle moisture in the atmosphere.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\n  \n \n  Wass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now,\nand glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a\nglass wall.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving,\ntoward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.\n  \n \n  The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.\n  \n \n  \"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must\nbe all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences\nof this. Then\u2014\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we\nseparated.\"\n  \n \n  Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic\nthrough the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused\nthis?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of\nthe planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\n  \n \n  Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well,\nalien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\n  \n \n  Wass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for\nhundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\n  \n \n  Wass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're\nboth wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at\nMartin. \"The wind\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood\nstraighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\n  \n \n  They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,\nand stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\n  \n \n  Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n  \n \n  \"The shield?\"\n  \n \n  Wass nodded. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we\nmight\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to\ncover the city.\"\n  \n \n  Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n  \n \n  \"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We\nmay have to....\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Rodney prompted.\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\n  \n \n  He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall\nbuildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and\nplain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately\nfollowing his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the\ncorridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and\nthe streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into\neither side of the corridor.\n  \n \n  It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\n  \n \n  Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted\ndownward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\n  \n \n  A call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It\nlooks like a switchboard.\"\n  \n \n  The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a\ngreat arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had\ncome to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining\nthrough the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick\nrope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal\nroof.\n  \n \n  \"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make\nassumptions ever since we got here.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\n  \n \n  Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\n  \n \n  Rodney turned. \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the\nswitch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\n  \n \n  He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you\nthink you're doing?\"\n  \n \n  \"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n  \n \n  \"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Then, more quietly\u2014\"We still have eleven hours to find a way\nout.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the\ntime it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow\nit, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.\nAnd Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n  \n \n  \"You too, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  \"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\n  \n \n  Martin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always\nthinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us\nthat much less time to find a way out. Martin\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you\nstand!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side,\nRodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.\n  \n \n  Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was\nloud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.\n  \n \n  Martin made a final effort. \"Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to\ntake off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his head negatively. \"No. Now, I know you, Martin.\nPostpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without\nus and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate\nourselves and God only knows what else and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.\n  \n \n  Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away\nsilently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.\n  \n \n  The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of\nRodney's sobs.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. \"Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The slight, blond man stood unmoving. \"I'm with you, Martin, but, as\na last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die\ngradually\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. \"I agree. As a last\nresort. We still have a little time.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight,\nnow that he was up again. \"Martin, I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Martin turned his back. \"Skip it, Rodney,\" he said gently.\n  \n \n  \"Water,\" Wass said thoughtfully. \"There must be reservoirs under this\ncity somewhere.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said, \"How does water help us get out?\"\n  \n \n  Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not\nlooking back. \"It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can\nleave the same way.\"\n  \n \n  Down the ramp again.\n  \n \n  \"There's another ramp,\" Wass murmured.\n  \n \n  Rodney looked down it. \"I wonder how many there are, all told.\"\n  \n \n  Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down,\npicking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the\npresent level. \"We'll find out,\" he said, \"how many there are.\"\n  \n \n  Eleven levels later Rodney asked, \"How much time have we now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seven hours,\" Wass said quietly, \"until take-off.\"\n  \n \n  \"One more level,\" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. \"I ...\nthink it's the last.\"\n  \n \n  They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of\nartificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.\n  \n \n  Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about\nthe floor. \"Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are\ncemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Rodney! Stop it!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney swallowed audibly. \"This place scares me....\"\n  \n \n  \"The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is different,\" Wass said. \"Built-in traps\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They had a war,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  Wass agreed. \"And the survivors retired here. Why?\"\n  \n \n  Martin said, \"They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built\nbefore the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I\nknow?\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned, too, persistent. \"But the planet was through with them.\"\n  \n \n  \"In a minute,\" Martin said, too irritably, \"we'll have a sentient\nplanet.\" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. \"Knock\nit off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.\"\n  \n \n  They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow\nshapes, looking carefully about them.\n  \n \n  Rodney paused. \"We might not recognize one.\"\n  \n \n  Martin urged him on. \"You know what a man-hole cover looks like.\" He\nadded dryly, \"Use your imagination.\"\n  \n \n  They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again,\nuncertain.\n  \n \n  Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.\n  \n \n  Wass said, \"All this had a purpose, once....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll disperse and search carefully,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what the pattern was.\"\n  \n \n  \"... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later\nexpeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.\"\n  \n \n  Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then\u2014\"Martin! Martin! I think\nI've found something!\"\n  \n \n  Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Here,\" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. \"Here. See?\nRight here.\"\n  \n \n  Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more\nfrom the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Well, they had hands.\" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of\nthe same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.\n  \n \n  From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped\nand turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?\"\n  \n \n  Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily\u2014almost too\neasily\u2014rotating the disk as it turned.\n  \n \n  Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed\nhinge.\n  \n \n  The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the\nsix-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that\ndrifted and eddied directly beneath them.\n  \n \n  Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.\n\"Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!\"\n  \n \n  Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the\nopening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.\n  \n \n  He was shaking.\n  \n<doc-sep>After a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember\nthe wind? Air currents are moving it.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.\nThen\u2014\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\"\n  \n \n  Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,\notherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun\nloosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\"\n  \n \n  Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney\nand he, too, had drawn his gun.\n  \n \n  The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,\noutlined in the light of two torches.\n  \n \n  For a little while he was alone.\n  \n \n  Then\u2014causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney\u2014a\ntenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about\nMartin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,\nobscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange\nobjects.\n  \n \n \n \n  Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering\nspirals.\n  \n \n  Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said\nnothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and\nnow, himself.\n  \n \n  \"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance.\n  \n \n  \"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered.\n  \n \n  Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a\ntorch swinging wildly on the end of it.\n  \n \n  The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently\nrolling mounds of fine, white stuff.\n  \n \n  Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip\nof the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the\nswitches and blow yourself to smithereens?\"\n  \n \n  Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him\ndisgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into\nthe infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom\nof the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He\nstamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing\njump. He sank no farther than his knees.\n  \n \n  He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest\nedge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long\nas we avoid the drifts.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and\nsank into the dust.\n  \n \n  \"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way,\nI'll go mine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wass!\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.\n  \n \n  The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied\nand swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were\nhard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.\n  \n \n  \"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Martin growled.\n  \n \n  There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.\nThe two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously\nplunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times\nwithout number.\n  \n \n  Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours,\nMartin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\"\n  \n \n  Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his\nthroat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,\nhis flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.\n  \n \n  A grate.\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"Wass!\" he shouted. \"We've found a way out!\"\n  \n \n  Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. \"I'm at the switchboard now,\nMartin. I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.\n  \n \n  The grate groaned upward and stopped.\n  \n \n  Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he\nbegan to scream.\n  \n \n  Martin switched off his radio, sick.\n  \n \n  He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.\n\"Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been trying to get you,\" Rodney said, frantically. \"Why didn't\nyou answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"We couldn't do anything for him.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's face was white and drawn. \"But he did this for us.\"\n  \n \n  \"So he did,\" Martin said, very quietly.\n  \n \n  Rodney said nothing.\n  \n \n  Then Martin said, \"Did you listen until the end?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded, jerkily. \"He pulled three more switches. I couldn't\nunderstand it all. But\u2014Martin, dying alone like that in a place like\nthis\u2014!\"\n  \n \n  Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up\ntoward the surface. \"Come on, Rodney. Last lap.\"\n  \n \n  An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the\nedge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force\nshimmering, almost invisible, about it.\n  \n \n  Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.\nMartin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members\nstanding by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,\" someone said. It\nwas the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>  DUST UNTO DUST\n  \n \n  By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Humphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he'd found in the library. He\nheld it up and carefully compared the spinning cloud in his bedroom\nwith the illustration. The cloud rose and spun, assuming the identical\nshape of the illustration.\n  \n \n  \"It's a twister,\" he said softly. \"A Kansas twister!\"\n  \n \n  \"What,\" MacBride asked, his bravado slipping away again, \"what ... is a\ntwister?\"\n  \n \n  The twister roared and moved out of the bedroom, out over the rear of\nthe house toward the side of the dome. \"It says here,\" Fownes shouted\nover the roaring, \"that Dorothy traveled from Kansas to Oz in a twister\nand that ... and that Oz is a wonderful and mysterious land\n   \n   beyond the\nconfines of everyday living\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  MacBride's eyes and mouth were great zeros.\n  \n \n  \"Is there something I can turn?\" Lanfierre asked.\n  \n \n  Huge chunks of glass began to fall around them.\n  \n \n  \"Fownes!\" MacBride shouted. \"This is a direct order! Make it go back!\"\n  \n \n  But Fownes had already begun to run on toward the next house, dodging\nmountainous puffs of glass as he went. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\" he shouted.\n\"Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshazaway!\"\n  \n \n  The dome weevils were going berserk trying to keep up with the\nprecipitation. They whirred back and forth at frightful speed, then,\nemptied of molten glass, rushed to the Trough which they quickly\nemptied and then rushed about empty-handed. \"Yoo-hoo!\" he yelled,\nrunning. The artificial sun vanished behind the mushrooming twister.\nOptimum temperature collapsed. \"Mrs. Deshazaway!\n   \n   Agnes\n   \n  , will you\nmarry me? Yoo-hoo!\"\n  \n \n  Lanfierre and Lieutenant MacBride leaned against their car and waited,\ndazed.\n  \n \n  There was quite a large fall of glass.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>He crossed with the floating moon-motion to the airlock and entered,\nclosing the door behind him. The darkness slowly filled with air, and\nthe temperature inside the suit declined steadily. At the proper moment\nof pressure, the inner lock slid open and Major Winship stepped into\nthe illuminated central area. His foot was lifted for the second step\nwhen the floor beneath him rose and fell gently, pitching him forward,\noff balance. He stumbled against the table and ended up seated beside\nthe radio equipment. The ground moved again.\n  \n \n  \"Charlie! Charlie!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm okay,\" Major Winship answered. \"Okay! Okay!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was additional surface movement. The movement ceased.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Les, how's it look?\" Capt. Wilkins asked.\n  \n \n  \"Okay from this side. Charlie, you still okay?\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay,\" Major Winship said. \"We told them this might happen,\" he added\nbitterly.\n  \n \n  There was a wait during which everyone seemed to be holding their\nbreath.\n  \n \n  \"I guess it's over,\" said Major Winship, getting to his feet. \"Wait a\nbit more, there may be an after-shock.\" He switched once again to the\nemergency channel.\n  \n \n  \"Is Pinov,\" came the supremely relaxed voice. \"Help?\"\n  \n \n  Major Winship whinnied in disgust. \"\n   \n   Nyet!\n   \n  \" he snarled. To the other\nAmericans: \"Our comrades seem unconcerned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tough.\"\n  \n \n  They began to get the static for the first time. It crackled and\nsnapped in their speakers. They made sounds of disapproval at each\nother. For a minute or two, static blanked out the communications\ncompletely. It then abated to something in excess of normal.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Lt. Chandler commented, \"even though we didn't build this thing\nto withstand a moonquake, it seems to have stood up all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess I was just\u2014\" Major Winship began. \"Oh, hell! We're losing\npressure. Where's the markers?\"\n  \n \n  \"By the lug cabinet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Got 'em,\" Major Winship said a moment later.\n  \n \n  He peeled back a marker and let it fall. Air currents whisked it away\nand plastered it against a riveted seam of the dome. It pulsed as\nthough it were breathing and then it ruptured.\n  \n \n  Major Winship moved quickly to cut out the emergency air supply which\nhad cut in automatically with the pressure drop. \"You guys wait. It's\non your right side, midway up. I'll try to sheet it.\"\n  \n \n  He moved for the plastic sheeting.\n  \n \n  \"We've lost about three feet of calk out here,\" Capt. Lawler said. \"I\ncan see more ripping loose. You're losing pressure fast at this rate.\"\n  \n \n  Major Winship pressed the sheeting over the leak. \"How's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't think I've got enough pressure left to hold it, now. It's\nsprung a little, and I can't get it to conform over the rivet heads.\"\n  \n \n  There was a splatter of static.\n  \n \n  \"Damn!\" Major Winship said, \"they should have made these things more\nflexible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Still coming out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Best I can do.\" Major Winship stepped back. The sheet began slowly\nto slide downward, then it fell away completely and lay limply on the\nfloor.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in,\" he said dryly.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "They are bound by a sense of duty to the mission. However, when they are put in the predicament of being trapped under the dome, their bond begins to fray and they start fighting with each other about the best means of escape.\nRodney and Martin squabble, but both stick together in exploring an underground tunnel filled with dust while Wass elects to go his own way. Wass ultimately appears to sacrifice his life to save Rodney and Martin by returning to the switchboard and opening a grate that allows them to escape from the city. \n",
        "Summary_2": "As colleagues and explorers, at first their relationship is well-balanced and intellectually-stimulating. They bounce ideas off of each other about the city, the force field, and its inhabitants. However, as soon as they realize that they\u2019re stuck, their relationship begins to crumble. \nAs each man feels their self-preservation instincts rise, their banter becomes more and more tense. After Wass reveals that they are stuck inside of the city due to the dome surrounding it, all three meet back in the center to find another way out. This is where the great source of their conflict begins. They explore one of the buildings and find a switchboard in it relatively quickly. Rodney and Wass want to flick some switches and see what happens, but Martin disagrees. They all pull their guns on each other, until Martin can convince them to only use the switchboard as a last resort. Over the course of the story, Rodney and Wass continually make Martin do things first, whether that be leading them on paths or travelling down the hatch. Wass and Rodney would often pull their guns out on him too, but Martin stayed relatively calm. \nAfter the discovery of the tunnel system, Rodney follows Martin down the hatch, but Wass shuts them in. He makes his way back to the switchboard, certain that his way is right and theirs is wrong. Although their relationship was pretty strong at first, their survival instinct, genuine fear, and malignant nature of the city all played a part to further divide the three. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Martin seems to be the de facto leader of the group, guiding them through the important decisions that lead them through the city. Rodney and Wass oscillate between being obedient followers and fearful, panicky crewmates who want to think and act independently. Wass has a stronger connection to the metaphysical elements of the metal city and seems to remember the place from his nightmares. He has an intense curiosity about the patterns he discovers in the metal architecture as well as the seeds he discovers in the glass cases. Martin is often impatient with his two crewmembers, particularly Rodney, whom he punches in the face and knocks to the ground to prevent him from flipping switches on the switchboard they discover. He also seems disgusted by Wass when he refuses to follow them into the dust current. Wass sacrifices himself to save his fellow crewmembers, although his death is shrouded in mystery.",
        "Summary_4": "Martin is clearly in charge, though he does not have a gentle hand. He threatens his crewmates frequently, putting them at gunpoint at multiple times throughout the story. Although it was Rodney who found the hatch that would get them out, Martin was the one who did the honors to open it, after shooting down the other ideas that the crew had including using the switchboard. Rodney wants to get things moving quickly, and wants to use the switchboard to try for a way out, but this is when Martin pulls a gun on him. Rodney also flips a random switch which makes Martin tackle him, so it seems that their dynamic is focused on Rodney doing reckless things and Martin wanting to get his way while trying to survive. Wass offers ideas to the other throughout their journey but he does not seem to be taken seriously, asking many general questions as he tries to interpret what is happening to him. However, it is Wass that got Rodney and Martin out in the end. "

The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n  \n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully\u2014a tunnel, now\u2014getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n  \n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern.

Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n<doc-sep>  DUST UNTO DUST\n  \n \n  By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city\u2014even a city like this one\u2014in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet\u2014the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis\u2014was\u2014for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not\u2014not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the\u2014well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering\u2014\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out\u2014and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen\u2014\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively\u2014\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw\u2014I thought I\nsaw\u2014something\u2014moving\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\nretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\nmouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\nthroats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\nout for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\nyell....\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\nonce.\"\n  \n \n  \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\nnarco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\nparade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\nwas no killing.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're alive?\"\n  \n \n  \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\n  \n \n  \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what\nfoods\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\n  \n \n  \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want\nmore information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship?\nWhat happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the\nbig parade?\"\n  \n \n  \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\n  \n \n  \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...\nTerrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were\nstrange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\"\n  \n \n  \"Guns? No, no guns\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them;\nhelped them to death.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\n  \n \n  \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking\nfor them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a\nbrisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close\ncall, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the\nstrange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we\nfelt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships\ncame, we realized our error. But we feared to speak. We purged our\nguilty leaders, concealed what had happened, and ... offered our\nfriendship. We invited the opening of diplomatic relations. We made\na blunder, it is true, a great blunder. But we have tried to make\namends....\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is the ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with it? It was too big to just walk off and forget.\nWhere is it?\"\n  \n \n  The two Groacians exchanged looks.\n  \n \n  \"We wish to show our contrition,\" Fith said. \"We will show you the\nship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said. \"If I don't come back in a reasonable length\nof time, transmit that recording to Regional Headquarters, sealed.\" He\nstood, looked at the Groaci.\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" he said.\n  \n<doc-sep>Verana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\n  \n \n  Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\n   \n   Who\n   \n  are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n  \n \n  \"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n  \n \n  \"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n  \n \n  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n<doc-sep>And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which\nreminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't\n   \n   ever\n   \n  going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me\nand might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n  \n \n  As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,\n\"What do you do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,\nof course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda\nto be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about\nit.\n  \n \n  Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included\nwrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him\nin my own fashion, when the time came.\n  \n \n  He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the\nore-sleds?\"\n  \n \n  I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n  \n \n  \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?\nDon't you people ever test them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's\ninformation to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and\ntheir cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them\nbefore de-radiating them?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"No. Why should we?\"\n  \n \n  \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n  \n \n  \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n  \n \n  He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself\nthan to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into\nyour caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n  \n \n  I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with\na fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n  \n \n  Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of\ncourse not!\"\n  \n \n  \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same\nstupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out\nof the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,\nbefore he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it\ntook for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He\nstarted pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion\nas he talked. \"Is this the\n   \n   natural\n   \n  life of man? It is not. Is this\neven a\n   \n   desirable\n   \n  life for man? It is\n   \n   definitely\n   \n  not.\" He spun back\nto face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed\nit as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.\n\"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was\ngrowing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all\nthe time. He was planning to tackle\n   \n   space\n   \n  ! The moon first, and then\nthe planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,\nwaiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching\nout for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it.\n  \n<doc-sep>I listened to all this in silence. \"But,\" I said when she had finished,\n\"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine\nlaborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie frowned. \"I'm not sure I can answer the first of those\nquestions,\" she replied. \"You must remember Antlers Park has been on\nthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted\nhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n  \n \n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens\nbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master\ncontrolling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners\nwere in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would\nbe susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you\ncoming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Coming with you?\" I repeated. \"Where?\"\n  \n \n  The old lady lit a cigarette. \"Pluto maybe,\" she said. \"There's a penal\ncolony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new\ncrime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,\nfugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....\"\n  \n \n  \"Grannie,\" I laughed. \"You're incorrigible!\"\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Choosing to search underground for where water might enter and exit the city was an important step for them to find the tunnel that led to their escape. However, Wass\u2019 pulling levers at the switchboard was critical to opening the grate inside the tunnel that actually allowed them to leave. Otherwise, they did not have tools with them that would have likely allowed them to escape in time.\nIf Martin had not forced the team to join together when they were fighting over the control panel the first time, they likely may have never escaped as well.",
        "Summary_2": "After Rodney and Martin decided to escape through the tunnels, Wass stayed aboveground, taunting them. He thought his best chances were with the switchboard. While they traversed underground, he made his way back to the switchboard. With only two hours to spare, Rodney and Martin were faced with a closed grate. Wass came on through the radio, making fun of them, and then began to pull switches. Luckily enough, one of the switches he pulled activated the grate and it opened for them. Soon, they hear Wass screaming as he\u2019s dying. Martin and Rodney escape through the grate, which tunnels upward around 200 feet from the edge of the city. Because of Wass, they were able to escape alive. ",
        "Summary_3": "The discovery of the seeds leads Martin to assume there must be some kind of water source within the depths of the metal city, so they use the ramps to access the bottommost level. The team discovers a hatch there that opens to a sea of dust. Rodney and Martin lower themselves into the dust current, but Wass refuses to join them, choosing instead to stay in the city to test the switches Rodney had discovered earlier. Martin warns him that this is likely a death sentence, but Wass does not seem to care. Martin and Rodney follow the current to a metal grate, and Wass triggers the switch to open the gate. In doing so, he is killed in a mysterious fashion. Martin and Rodney crawl through a tunnel and surface outside the barrier of the metal city just in time to be picked up by their main ship before its return to their planet.",
        "Summary_4": "In order to escape the city, the men had to travel as far down as they could, looking for a reservoir that might have some kind of exit pathway. They do find a large hatch in the bottom of the building they are in, where Martin and Rodney jump into a deep pile of dust that they essentially wade through in order to make their way towards an exit. However, the pipe that they find to escape through is shut by a metal grate. Wass had never jumped through the hatch, and while standing at the switchboard, flipped four switches that raised the grate for them. Wass died while trying to open the escape route for his crewmates, but if it were not for him they would not have made it out alive."

He looked over\nat the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on\ngetting killed doing this?\"\n  \n \n  \"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six\neggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\nthe egg.\n  \n \n  \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\n  \n \n  The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\nsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see\nTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open\nand leaned out.\n  \n \n  \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\nget the egg.\"\n  \n \n  While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\nwaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.\nKershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred\npounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.\n  \n \n  Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's\nshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the\ncabin was crowded.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\n  \n \n  \"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to\nHarriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might\nask him to tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that\nworried Asa.\n  \n \n  \"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In\nanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't\n   \n   Guns\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pistols\n   \n  ; and it wasn't\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pluto\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n  \n \n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n  \n \n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  Theater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n  \n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\n   \n   zilcon\n   \n  wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men\u2014all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n  \n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\n  \n \n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n  \n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n  \n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n  \n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n  \n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  The\n  fat man rang the\nbell. It was a while before an\nanswer came.\n  \n \n  It was a reedy woman in a\nhousecoat, her hair in curlers,\nher eyes red and swollen.\n  \n \n  \"Now, now,\" Dawes said\ngently. \"Don't you take on\nlike that, Mrs. Brundage. You\nheard the charges. It hadda\nbe this way.\"\n  \n \n  \"My poor Vincent,\" she\nsobbed.\n  \n \n  \"Better let us up,\" the\nSheriff said kindly. \"No use\njust lettin' him lay there,\nMrs. Brundage.\"\n  \n \n  \"He didn't mean no harm,\"\nthe woman snuffled. \"He was\njust purely ornery, Vincent\nwas. Just plain mean stubborn.\"\n  \n \n  \"The law's the law,\" the\nfat man sighed.\n  \n \n  Sol couldn't hold himself\nin.\n  \n \n  \"What law? Who's dead?\nHow did it happen?\"\n  \n \n  Dawes looked at him disgustedly.\n\"Now is it any of\n   \n   your\n   \n  business? I mean, is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" Sol said\nmiserably.\n  \n \n  \"You better stay out of\nthis,\" the Sheriff warned.\n\"This is a local matter, young\nman. You better stay in the\nshop while we go up.\"\n  \n \n  They filed past him and the\ncrying Mrs. Brundage.\n  \n \n  When they were out of\nsight, Sol pleaded with her.\n  \n \n  \"What happened? How did\nyour husband die?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please ...\"\n  \n \n  \"You must tell me! Was it\nsomething to do with Armagon?\nDo you dream about the\nplace, too?\"\n  \n \n  She was shocked at the\nquestion. \"Of course!\"\n  \n \n  \"And your husband? Did\nhe have the same dream?\"\n  \n \n  Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't\nyou leave me alone?\" She\nturned her back. \"I got things\nto do. You can make yourself\ncomfortable\u2014\" She indicated\nthe barber chairs, and left\nthrough the back door.\n  \n \n  Sol looked after her, and\nthen ambled over to the first\nchair and slipped into the\nhigh seat. His reflection in\nthe mirror, strangely gray in\nthe dim light, made him\ngroan. His clothes were a\nmess, and he needed a shave.\nIf only Brundage had been\nalive ...\n  \n \n  He leaped out of the chair\nas voices sounded behind the\ndoor. Dawes was kicking it\nopen with his foot, his arms\nladen with two rather large\nfeet, still encased in bedroom\nslippers. Charlie was at the\nother end of the burden,\nwhich appeared to be a middle-aged\nman in pajamas. The\nSheriff followed the trio up\nwith a sad, undertaker expression.\nBehind him came Mrs.\nBrundage, properly weeping.\n  \n \n  \"We'll take him to the funeral\nparlor,\" Dawes said,\nbreathing hard. \"Weighs a\nton, don't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"What killed him?\" Sol\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Heart attack.\"\n  \n \n  The fat man chuckled.\n  \n \n  The tableau was grisly. Sol\nlooked away, towards the\ncomfortingly mundane atmosphere\nof the barber shop. But\neven the sight of the thick-padded\nchairs, the shaving\nmugs on the wall, the neat\nrows of cutting instruments,\nseemed grotesque and morbid.\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they\nwent through the doorway.\n\"About my car\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Sheriff turned and regarded\nhim lugubriously.\n\"Your\n   \n   car\n   \n  ?

        "Summary_1": "Asa Graybar is a biological engineer who studies keeping Slider eggs alive and he is accused of a crime at the opening of the story. He thinks he was framed by Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne\u2019s general manager.\nHe was offered one year as a \u201cchangeling\u201d on another planet or 5 years in rehabilitation on Earth. He elects to do the one year, and thinks that he will get into smuggling Slider eggs on Jordan\u2019s planet. Being a changeling is not a highly sought after line of work, but it pays well, and the people who do it have organs and body parts regenerated to better suit specialized tasks.\nAsa travels to Jordan\u2019s planet on a spaceship with a cellmate, Kershaw, who got caught stealing a Slider egg and is returning to serve more time. When they arrive they are both \u201cconverted\u201d into muck men, with the forms of frogs and scaly, pink skin. Their task is to collect Slider eggs and bring them back to the base which is watched over by a warden, Furston.\nAsa and Kershaw go out together for the first time into the mud so Kershaw can teach Asa how to find Slider eggs. They find one, and are immediately attacked by a Slider that disables one of Kershaw\u2019s legs. Kershaw calls for helicopters to come get them. Tom Dorr is operating the helicopter that comes to collect Kershaw in the field, and demands that Asa also give him the egg they found. Asa refuses to ensure his own safety that they would come back to get him as soon as they dropped off Kershaw.\nBack at the base Tom Dorr refuses to go back into the field to rescue Asa and gets into an argument with Harriet Hazeltyne (taking over charge of all operations for her father), and storms off. Harriet goes into the field to save Asa herself, but accidentally crashes the helicopter because she is not used to the double force of gravity. \nAsa is unable to right the helicopter, and they think it is unlikely they will be able to use its machine guns to keep them safe while the Sliders come to feed on the dead Slider they are near to in the night. They must get back to the base somehow, and the story ends with them contemplating how they might do this.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Asa Graybar is a biological engineer researching Slider eggs and was set up to be convicted of trying to steal one, most likely by Tom Dorr, the Hazeltyne company\u2019s general manager. Asa can serve five years in a rehabilitation clinic or one year working as a changeling on another planet. Asa chooses to work one year as a muck man on Jordan\u2019s Planet where the Slider eggs are harvested. Medical advancements allow doctors to adapt humans to work in the environments of the other planets, so Asa will have to undergo the change, making him a changeling. \n\tAsa travels to Jordan on a freighter but is kept locked up as a prisoner. His cellmate is Kershaw, a man who has worked as a muck man in the past. He loved Slider eggs so much that when he returned to Earth, he tried to steal a new one because they flashed so much more than the two-year-old egg that he could afford with his $9000 in earnings. Kershaw tells Asa that he thinks the slider egg flashes are the egg calling their mothers and explains how they handle the Sliders that attack when muck men remove an egg from the mud. \n\tOn Jordan, Asa has second thoughts but realizes that there is no turning back on becoming a changeling. Awakening after his transformation, Asa finds Kershaw waiting for him, and he helps Asa learn to hop rather than walk since they have the physical features of frogs now. Furston, the trusty/warden/parole officer, sends Kershaw to work and Asa for training. He also gives Asa some berries to eat that make him vomit; Furston tells him this is to make the point that everything that grows on the planet is poisonous, and Asa shouldn\u2019t get the idea that he can hide out until his term is up because he would starve to death. As he leaves, Asa sees two humans watching him from an observation tower and hops up to see who they are: Harriet Hazeltyne and Tom Dorr. \n\tFurston has Kershaw take Asa out to show him the ropes. Kershaw finds an egg, and Asa warns him to jump when he sees a Slider coming. Kershaw breaks a leg, and Asa manages to kill the Slider. When the helicopter arrives, Harriet and Tom Dorr are aboard. Asa refuses to give them the egg until he loads Kershaw. Then Dorr says there isn\u2019t room for Asa, and they will come back for him. Asa keeps the egg as insurance for them to return but later realizes that Dorr can come back later with another mucker.\n\tFinally, the helicopter returns, but it crashes. Harriet was flying it because Dorr refused to come back for Asa. She tells Asa that a dead Slider attracts other Sliders that will feed on it. Asa tries to upright the helicopter but can\u2019t, so they either have to stay and fight off the Sliders or try to make their way back to the facility.\n",
        "Summary_3": "At the start of the story, Asa Graybar has been convicted of a crime he believes he has been framed for: keeping a rare, fresh Slider egg in a lab. His options for punishment are five years in a \"social reorientation\" program or one year working on a different planet after modifying his body to function in a different environment. Asa's cellmate seems to think this is the much more dangerous option, but it's the one Asa chooses. The technology of the time allows for regeneration of cells, extending people's lives and allowing them to modify their anatomy to fit a different environment. Asa wants to go to Jordan's Planet specifically, and there is always need for workers there because it is dangerous, so he is able to get a post there. Kershaw, another convict, is on the same trip--he has done this work before. The two men are most interested in the eggs of a creature called a Slider. The eggs have beautiful clear shells and seem to discharge lightning, in a way the humans do not yet understand--being muck men on Jordan's Planet means hunting for these eggs. The eggs die over the course of four years, and Asa wants to find a way to preserve them--this would be a hit to the Hazeltyne monopoly, which Asa believes is the source of his being framed. After arriving on Jordan's Planet, Asa and Kershaw head to the conversion tanks and their bodies are modified to suit the planet. The result is frog-like with pinkish scaly skin and a pair of wings. Asa learns he has to hop instead of walk, and Kershaw gives him pointers as they head to meet Furston, the man who would assign them their jobs. Hazeltyne's daughter (Harriet) and general manager (Tom Dorr), who had been present at Asa's trial, watched as Asa trained--it seems Asa's not the only one who dislikes Dorr. Asa is given supplies to go on a muck trip with Kershaw so that he does not go on his first trip solo. Once they find a safe location, they start to dig for eggs, and Kershaw finds one. As it flashes, the mother Slider starts to run towards the men who run for their lives and call the rescue helicopter. Kershaw manages to drop the egg, and the two men fight under attack by the Slider. Asa recovers the egg as the helicopter arrives with Tom Dorr and Harriet inside, and Asa is worried by Dorr's demeanor. There is only space for one of the men in the helicopter but Asa seems to have been abandoned as he waits for the return. It turns out Dorr didn't think it was worth going back for Asa because he talked back to him. Eventually Harriet Hazeltyne makes it to him, but she crashes the helicopter because although she is a great pilot on Earth, she is not used to the gravity on this planet. ",
        "Summary_4": "Asa Graybar is convicted of stealing a slider egg from Hazeltyne Company. He believes he has been framed by Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne\u2019s general manager, who has brought the owner\u2019s daughter Harriet to the courtroom. Asa is given his choice of two sentences; rather than a relatively comfortable five years in a rehab clinic, Asa opts for a year as a changeling so that he can go to Jordan\u2019s Planet and study slider eggs. He believes his work with eggs prompted the Hazeltyne Company to frame him.\n\nAsa chooses to go to Jordan\u2019s Planet, where the eggs come from. On his way there, he meets Kershaw, a repeat muck man infatuated with the eggs.  Both men are turned into muck men: large, mutated creatures with some oddly unsettling human facial features. Humans have discovered how to prolong life and regenerate organs, which has also led to the changeling process, where convicts can be physiologically altered to be suited for life on other planets. \n\nAsa is trained to use his new body and reckon with the double gravity on the planet. The next day, Kershaw shows Asa the ropes until Kershaw finds an egg. His appreciation of it clouds his judgement, and Asa realizes just in time that Kershaw warned him that the sliders typically attack when the eggs are removed. A slider injures Kershaw\u2019s leg, and Asa jumps out of the way and calls for help before killing the slider in the nick of time. \n\nWhen a helicopter arrives, Tom Dorr and Harriet are in it. Asa insists that they should take the injured Kershaw and he should stay with the egg, since they both won\u2019t fit in the helicopter. Dorr demands that Asa give him the egg, but Asa refuses. The helicopter leaves Asa alone with the egg. \n\nAsa starts to get worried when the helicopter hasn\u2019t returned an hour later, and hopes the sliders don\u2019t attack at night. The helicopter comes back, but it lands clumsily and sticks in the mud. Harriet explains that she is a skilled pilot, but not in this gravity. She also details how she and Dorr argued because he wanted to leave Asa there and let the sliders (who do feed at night, on their own kind like the dead one near Asa) have at him. She told Dorr that she didn\u2019t like how he was running her father\u2019s business, and he told her to run it and stormed off. \n\nAs the passage ends, Asa and Harriet are in the midst of a dicey situation. He can\u2019t lift the helicopter up, and he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019d have a chance of fighting off the sliders in the rain - they\u2019ll have to try to make their way back. He asks Harriet where the rest of the muck men are, and she says they were all called back when the first helicopter came out, but that some may not be back yet. \n"

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>  SURVIVAL\n   \n  TACTICS\n  \n \n  By AL SEVCIK\n  \n \n  ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK\n  \n \n \n   The robots were built to serve\nMan; to do his work, see to his\ncomforts, make smooth his way.\nThen the robots figured out an\nadditional service\u2014putting Man\nout of his misery.\n   \n \n \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had\nground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid\ndesolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was\ngoing stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that\nshiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly\nhe had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't\ndared touch the machine since.\n  \n \n  For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never\nbeen further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised\nhis wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on\na trailer tour of the\n   \n   West\n   \n  that very summer. Since that promise, he\ncould not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and\nbe-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out\nof his subconscious. Yet he\n   \n   had\n   \n  to write at least three novelets and\na fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great\nadventure\u2014or the trip was off.\n  \n \n  So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed\nfor his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a\nsalable yarn....\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the\nroad. \"What's the trouble?\"\n  \n \n  Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the\nstranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech\nand his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand\nclamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of\nhis head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.\n  \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When his\nship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been\nstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\nInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how\nwe operate?\"\n  \n \n  He told her the tales he'd heard.\n  \n<doc-sep>The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n  \n \n  \"So far. Keep talking.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  The\n  fat man rang the\nbell. It was a while before an\nanswer came.\n  \n \n  It was a reedy woman in a\nhousecoat, her hair in curlers,\nher eyes red and swollen.\n  \n \n  \"Now, now,\" Dawes said\ngently. \"Don't you take on\nlike that, Mrs. Brundage. You\nheard the charges. It hadda\nbe this way.\"\n  \n \n  \"My poor Vincent,\" she\nsobbed.\n  \n \n  \"Better let us up,\" the\nSheriff said kindly. \"No use\njust lettin' him lay there,\nMrs. Brundage.\"\n  \n \n  \"He didn't mean no harm,\"\nthe woman snuffled. \"He was\njust purely ornery, Vincent\nwas. Just plain mean stubborn.\"\n  \n \n  \"The law's the law,\" the\nfat man sighed.\n  \n \n  Sol couldn't hold himself\nin.\n  \n \n  \"What law? Who's dead?\nHow did it happen?\"\n  \n \n  Dawes looked at him disgustedly.\n\"Now is it any of\n   \n   your\n   \n  business? I mean, is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" Sol said\nmiserably.\n  \n \n  \"You better stay out of\nthis,\" the Sheriff warned.\n\"This is a local matter, young\nman. You better stay in the\nshop while we go up.\"\n  \n \n  They filed past him and the\ncrying Mrs. Brundage.\n  \n \n  When they were out of\nsight, Sol pleaded with her.\n  \n \n  \"What happened? How did\nyour husband die?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please ...\"\n  \n \n  \"You must tell me! Was it\nsomething to do with Armagon?\nDo you dream about the\nplace, too?\"\n  \n \n  She was shocked at the\nquestion. \"Of course!\"\n  \n \n  \"And your husband? Did\nhe have the same dream?\"\n  \n \n  Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't\nyou leave me alone?\" She\nturned her back. \"I got things\nto do. You can make yourself\ncomfortable\u2014\" She indicated\nthe barber chairs, and left\nthrough the back door.\n  \n \n  Sol looked after her, and\nthen ambled over to the first\nchair and slipped into the\nhigh seat. His reflection in\nthe mirror, strangely gray in\nthe dim light, made him\ngroan. His clothes were a\nmess, and he needed a shave.\nIf only Brundage had been\nalive ...\n  \n \n  He leaped out of the chair\nas voices sounded behind the\ndoor. Dawes was kicking it\nopen with his foot, his arms\nladen with two rather large\nfeet, still encased in bedroom\nslippers. Charlie was at the\nother end of the burden,\nwhich appeared to be a middle-aged\nman in pajamas. The\nSheriff followed the trio up\nwith a sad, undertaker expression.\nBehind him came Mrs.\nBrundage, properly weeping.\n  \n \n  \"We'll take him to the funeral\nparlor,\" Dawes said,\nbreathing hard. \"Weighs a\nton, don't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"What killed him?\" Sol\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Heart attack.\"\n  \n \n  The fat man chuckled.\n  \n \n  The tableau was grisly. Sol\nlooked away, towards the\ncomfortingly mundane atmosphere\nof the barber shop. But\neven the sight of the thick-padded\nchairs, the shaving\nmugs on the wall, the neat\nrows of cutting instruments,\nseemed grotesque and morbid.\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they\nwent through the doorway.\n\"About my car\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Sheriff turned and regarded\nhim lugubriously.\n\"Your\n   \n   car\n   \n  ? Young man, ain't\nyou got no\n   \n   respect\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Sol swallowed hard and fell\nsilent. He went outside with\nthem, the woman slamming\nthe barber-shop door behind\nhim. He waited in front of\nthe building while the men\ntoted away the corpse to some\nnew destination.\n <doc-sep> \n  MUCK MAN\n  \n \n  BY FREMONT DODGE\n  \n \n  The work wasn't hard, but there were some sacrifices.\n   \n  You had to give up hope and freedom\u2014and being human!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the\nbailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her as\nold Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done.\nShe didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a\ngirl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises.\nShe was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified\ncriminal.

Asa felt\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\nrap?\"\n  \n \n  \"Five or one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n  \n \n  Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\nduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n  His only problem would be staying alive for a year.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story opens on Earth and then travels to Jordan\u2019s planet.\nJordan\u2019s planet is the place where Asa goes as a changeling to be a muck man. \nThere is a base on Jordan's planet which has a laboratory for converting prisoners into muck men, living quarters and kitchen, and a courtyard with high walls to keep the Sliders out. The surface of the planet is mud and the force of gravity is twice that on Earth. Asa's conversion into a frog-like person is necessary to survive there.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in the future when humans have traveled to the stars, and medical advancements have enabled humans to regenerate damaged or deficient organs, enabling them to live until about two hundred years of age. The events in the story take place in several locations. It all begins on Earth in a courtroom where Asa Graybar has just been found guilty. From there, Asa is taken down a corridor to his jail cell, which is very small because it only takes Asa four steps to reach the other side. Once Asa decides to become a changeling and work as a muck man on Jordan\u2019s Planet, he ships to the planet on a space freighter where he is kept in a cell for the entire trip but can hear voices in the corridor. \n\tWhen they reach Jordan\u2019s Planet, Asa experiences the discomfort of the double gravity that makes his heart pound to keep his blood circulating. After his conversion to a changeling, Asa goes outside the company\u2019s dome settlement with Kershaw. There was a constant gray drizzle, and most of the planet\u2019s surface was marsh, mud flats, and ponds. On the roof of the settlement building, there is an observation tower. Muck men eat at tables that are low enough to accommodate their froglike physiology. Out in the mud where the muck men work, there are small, slippery creatures. There were also large, segmented creatures called Sliders who lay the eggs that the muck men harvest and attack them when they take an egg. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place on two separate planets, and the ship that the protagonist takes to travel between the two. The first is Earth, where Asa Graybar is convicted of a crime he did not commit. We see small pieces of the courtroom and prison that Asa visits for some time, but the focus is on the second planet. Jordan's Planet, a planet covered in mud and swamp creatures, has gravity twice as strong as that of Earth. Humans have a hard time dealing with the extra gravity and the mud, so those that stay to do work on the planet undergo medical procedures to make them more like giant frogs to allow them to swim through patches of mud that are too big to jump over. Jordan's Planet is significant because of the animals that live there, more specifically the Sliders and the eggs that they lay. These eggs have great value on Earth, so Hazeltyne, a tycoon on Earth, has built a settlement on Jordan's Planet as a place to train convicts working to recover the eggs for his own personal gain. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place in a courtroom on Earth, a jail cell, an unspecified room where a medical exam takes place, a transport ship, and several locations on Jordan\u2019s Planet. On Jordan\u2019s Planet, the story moves from the medical office where the changeling conversions happen, a walled and partially covered courtyard where Asa does his training that houses multiple muck man-sized stalls, an office where Dorr and Harriet and the human higher ups work, and the muddy swamps where the muck men search for eggs. Jordan\u2019s Planet is muddy and treacherous, with double gravity. The story is set at an unspecified time in the future, when interplanetary travel and extreme biological mutations are commonplace and human lifespans average two-hundred years. \n"

        "Article": "Asa took a deep breath and looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.\nAsa leaped over to him.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good\none. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\"\n  \n \n  \"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over\nat the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on\ngetting killed doing this?\"\n  \n \n  \"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six\neggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\nthe egg.\n  \n \n  \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\n  \n \n  The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\nsettled down on broad skids.

The company manager swung the door open\nand leaned out.\n  \n \n  \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\nget the egg.\"\n  \n \n  While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\nwaist.

Once he was inside, Asa saw, the\ncabin was crowded.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\n  \n \n  \"Nope.

The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\nrap?\"\n  \n \n  \"Five or one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n  \n \n  Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\nduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n  His only problem would be staying alive for a year.\n  \n<doc-sep>A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty\nminutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.\n  \n \n  After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return\nfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg\napproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the\negg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\n  \n \n  Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\n  \n \n  \"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you\ncoming?\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\n  \n \n  If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him\nall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\n  \n \n  What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n  \n \n  A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n  \n \n  Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n  \n \n  \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n  \n \n  \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from\nthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard\nwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky\nof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud\nflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged\nalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\n  \n \n  From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them\nin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were\na gun and a long knife.\n  \n \n  \"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big\neverywhere in proportion.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Graybar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,\nyou.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\n  \n \n  \"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty\nand warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\n  \n \n  Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his\ndistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown\nhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim\nrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a\nnative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\n  \n \n  Furston laughed.\n  \n \n  \"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any\nideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is\nwhere you eat.\"\n  \n \n  Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He\nlifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from\nan observation tower on the roof.\n  \n \n  He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\n  \n \n  Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session\nwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\n  \n \n  The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried\nhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent\nposition to make the riddance permanent.\n  \n \n  At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with\nthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the\ntwo were doing out here.\n  \n \n  \"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of\nthe others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel\nhe is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the\noperations.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to\ncarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and\nassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called\nGraybar aside.\n  \n \n  \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week\nknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there\nand work that muck.\"\n  \n \n  Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could\nshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the\ncourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it\nand hopped along after Kershaw.\n  \n \n  Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the\nHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The\nmud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was\nnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins\nlike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded\nand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced\neye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\n  \n \n  \"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here\nlately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,\nstart shooting.\"\n  \n \n  At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no\nSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as\nmuch as on top of it.\n  \n \n  Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten\nyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in\nthe muck.\n  \n \n  \"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg\nwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to\nspot when the new weeds start growing.\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw took a long look around.\n  \n \n  \"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\n  \n \n  They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs\nof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually\na muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw\ndug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had\nto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit\nbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently\nbefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he\nworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything\nabout the operation was wrong.\n  \n \n  \"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping\nslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to\nwatch.\n  \n \n  \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of\nmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look\nat it.\"\n  \n \n \n  A SLIDER EGG\n  \n \n \n  The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds\nbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's\nearphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the\nscintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider\nfor help. Asa looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Jump!\" he shouted.\n  \n \n  At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black\nscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the\nweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row\nupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered\nits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot\nforward.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.\nWhile he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio\ndown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned\ninstantly, his gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw\nand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\n  \n \n  \"On the way.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by\nthe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the\nother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where\nKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working\nmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another\ncharge.\n  \n \n  Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The\nrocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray\nflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward\nAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw\nthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs\nwere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the\nSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he\nthrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired\nagain.\n  \n \n \n \n  Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered\nwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.\nDesperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body\nshiver and lie still.\n  \n",

        "Query": "What is the bond between Asa and Kershaw like in the story \"MUCK MAN\"?",
        "Article": "Asa took a deep breath and looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.\nAsa leaped over to him.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good\none. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\"\n  \n \n  \"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over\nat the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on\ngetting killed doing this?\"\n  \n \n  \"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six\neggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\nthe egg.\n  \n \n  \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\n  \n \n  The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\nsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see\nTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open\nand leaned out.\n  \n \n  \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\nget the egg.\"\n  \n \n  While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\nwaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.\nKershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred\npounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.\n  \n \n  Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's\nshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the\ncabin was crowded.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\n  \n \n  \"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to\nHarriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might\nask him to tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that\nworried Asa.\n  \n \n  \"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In\nanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.\n  \n<doc-sep>A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty\nminutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.\n  \n \n  After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return\nfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg\napproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the\negg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\n  \n \n  Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\n  \n \n  \"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you\ncoming?\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\n  \n \n  If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him\nall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\n  \n \n  What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n  \n \n  A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n  \n \n  Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n  \n \n  \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n  \n \n  \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from\nthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard\nwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky\nof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud\nflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged\nalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\n  \n \n  From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them\nin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were\na gun and a long knife.\n  \n \n  \"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big\neverywhere in proportion.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Graybar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,\nyou.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\n  \n \n  \"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty\nand warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\n  \n \n  Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his\ndistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown\nhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim\nrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a\nnative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\n  \n \n  Furston laughed.\n  \n \n  \"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any\nideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is\nwhere you eat.\"\n  \n \n  Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He\nlifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from\nan observation tower on the roof.\n  \n \n  He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\n  \n \n  Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session\nwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\n  \n \n  The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried\nhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent\nposition to make the riddance permanent.\n  \n \n  At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with\nthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the\ntwo were doing out here.\n  \n \n  \"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of\nthe others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel\nhe is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the\noperations.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to\ncarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and\nassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called\nGraybar aside.\n  \n \n  \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week\nknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there\nand work that muck.\"\n  \n \n  Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could\nshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the\ncourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it\nand hopped along after Kershaw.\n  \n \n  Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the\nHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The\nmud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was\nnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins\nlike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded\nand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced\neye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\n  \n \n  \"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here\nlately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,\nstart shooting.\"\n  \n \n  At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no\nSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as\nmuch as on top of it.\n  \n \n  Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten\nyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in\nthe muck.\n  \n \n  \"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg\nwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to\nspot when the new weeds start growing.\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw took a long look around.\n  \n \n  \"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\n  \n \n  They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs\nof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually\na muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw\ndug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had\nto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit\nbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently\nbefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he\nworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything\nabout the operation was wrong.\n  \n \n  \"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping\nslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to\nwatch.\n  \n \n  \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of\nmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look\nat it.\"\n  \n \n \n  A SLIDER EGG\n  \n \n \n  The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds\nbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's\nearphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the\nscintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider\nfor help. Asa looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Jump!\" he shouted.\n  \n \n  At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black\nscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the\nweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row\nupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered\nits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot\nforward.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.\nWhile he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio\ndown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned\ninstantly, his gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw\nand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\n  \n \n  \"On the way.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by\nthe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the\nother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where\nKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working\nmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another\ncharge.\n  \n \n  Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The\nrocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray\nflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward\nAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw\nthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs\nwere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the\nSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he\nthrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired\nagain.\n  \n \n \n \n  Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered\nwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.\nDesperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body\nshiver and lie still.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  MUCK MAN\n  \n \n  BY FREMONT DODGE\n  \n \n  The work wasn't hard, but there were some sacrifices.\n   \n  You had to give up hope and freedom\u2014and being human!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the\nbailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom.

Asa felt\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\nrap?\"\n  \n \n  \"Five or one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n  \n \n  Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\nduplicate.

        "Summary_1": "They meet as cellmates on their way to Jordan\u2019s planet to convert to muck men. They convert into frog-like forms together. Kershaw is assigned to pick up where he left off as a return prisoner and Asa is taught how to operate in his new body.\nKershaw teaches Asa the ropes of how to collect slider eggs as a muck man. One muck man is killed for about every 6 Slider eggs that are found, and it is extremely dangerous. During their first time out they have to fight a Slider and Kershaw breaks his leg, relying on Asa to save him. This task bonds them together as they must trust each other with their lives.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Asa and Kershaw have a friendly relationship. When they are in a cell together on the flight to Jordan\u2019s Planet, Kershaw tells Asa what it is like to work there because he has worked there before. He is going back because he was caught stealing a new Slider egg that he couldn\u2019t resist because it was so beautiful. Kershaw tells Asa his theory that the flashes of the eggs are the eggs calling to their mothers because when muck men take one out of the muck, a Slider always comes right away. Kershaw helps Asa learn how to hop after Kershaw\u2019s transformation, and he gives him helpful advice about doing what Furston says. Kershaw also teaches Asa how to recognize when Sliders have been in an area recently and when an egg has recently been laid. When Kershaw finds the egg, Asa saves him by yelling for him to jump and then shooting the Slider and radioing for the helicopter. When the aircraft arrives, Asa carries Kershaw and puts him on board.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Asa and Kershaw are both convicted criminals with an interest in Slider eggs, though Asa believes he has been framed. The two of them meet because they are on the same transport to Jordan's Planet, reporting for a year of service as muck men to avoid five years of rehabilitation. Kershaw has been to Jordan's Planet before, so he becomes a mentor to Asa and gives him tips on who the various figureheads are at the settlement, and on how to do the job safely. The two of them go on a mission together once they arrive so that Asa can learn the ropes. Asa supports Kershaw as they are attacked by a Slider after Kershaw is injured. Kershaw believes in the mantra that muck men stick together and look out for each other and this allowed the men to warm up to each other very quickly, and the way the story is set up it seems they will be close friends as their story continues.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Asa and Kershaw have a friendly relationship. Asa empathizes with Kershaw\u2019s obsession with the eggs, and Kershaw serves as a mentor to Asa since he has already done time as a muck man on Jordan Planet. Kershaw is glad to have not only tips and training from Kershaw, but insight into the eggs themselves, which Kershaw loves and Asa is determined to study and learn more about. Their relationship is relatively jovial, especially considering their circumstances, and they look out for each other. After Kershaw finds the egg and is injured by the slider, he is grateful to Asa for saving his life and Asa is protective of him, insisting that Kershaw get into the helicopter first. \n"

Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\nthe egg.\n  \n \n  \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\n  \n \n  The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\nsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see\nTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open\nand leaned out.\n  \n \n  \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\nget the egg.\"\n  \n \n  While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\nwaist.

But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n  \n \n  \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n  \n \n  \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  MUCK MAN\n  \n \n  BY FREMONT DODGE\n  \n \n  The work wasn't hard, but there were some sacrifices.\n   \n  You had to give up hope and freedom\u2014and being human!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the\nbailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her as\nold Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done.\nShe didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a\ngirl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises.\nShe was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified\ncriminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if\nshe had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types,\nand not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.\n  \n \n  Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\nrap?\"\n  \n \n  \"Five or one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n  \n \n  Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\nduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n  His only problem would be staying alive for a year.\n  \n<doc-sep>Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special\nenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion\nchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa\nGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard\nto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once\none of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on\nspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he\ndecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all\nhe learned about space travel.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or\ncellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More\nimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and\nhad wanted to return.\n  \n \n  \"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The\nones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun\nto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to\ngo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine\nthousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that\nflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\"\n  \n \n  Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could\nunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while\nthe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic\nfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played\ntiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.\nElectrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but\nthe phenomenon remained a mystery.\n  \n \n  Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to\nquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only\nrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of\nlight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.\n  \n \n  It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and\nfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had\never seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have\nmade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are\nthe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when\nyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes\nswooping out of nowhere at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the\nSliders?\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw grinned.\n  \n \n  \"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping\nfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.\nWhen the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in\nthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back\nand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter\ncomes\u2014and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake\u2014you live to\ntell the tale.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to\nlearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another\nphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was\npounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the\ndoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.\n  \n \n  \"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests.\n  \n \n  Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning\nto lose consciousness.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" he thought in panic.\n  \n \n  He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before\nconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance\nto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the\nconversion tank right now.\n  \n \n  When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for\na long time he was afraid to open his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\"\n  \n \n  It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his\neyes.\n  \n \n  Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one\nstand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that\nhis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his\nlower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward\nso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around\nas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with\nbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like\nclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of\nhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.\n  \n \n  This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.\n  \n \n  It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong\ntraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly\nemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under\nthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could\nstill weep.\n  \n \n  He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only\ntry hopping this time. And take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerve\nand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as high\nas Kershaw's head.\n  \n \n  \"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll\ngo outside.\"\n  \n \n  Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of\nfabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as\nKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room\nwhere they had been left to revive from conversion.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\n  He\n  was tired and very\nsleepy, and his customary\nnightly review was limited to\na few detached thoughts\nabout the wedding he was\nsupposed to attend in Salinas\nthat weekend ... the hoodlum\nwho had responded to his\ngood-nature by dumping him\nout of his own car ... the slogging\nwalk to the village ...\nthe little round woman who\nwas hurrying off, like the\nWhite Rabbit, to some mysterious\nappointment on the\nupper floor ...\n  \n \n  Then he went to sleep.\n  \n \n  A voice awoke him, shrill\nand questioning.\n  \n \n  \"Are you\n   \n   nakkid\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  His eyes flew open, and he\npulled the towel protectively\naround his body and glared\nat the little girl with the rust-red\npigtails.\n  \n \n  \"Huh, mister?\" she said,\npushing a finger against her\nfreckled nose. \"Are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said angrily. \"I'm\nnot naked. Will you please\ngo away?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sally!\" It was Mom, appearing\nin the doorway of the\nparlor. \"You leave the gentleman\nalone.\" She went off\nagain.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Sol said. \"Please let\nme get dressed. If you don't\nmind.\" The girl didn't move.\n\"What time is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dunno,\" Sally shrugged.\n\"I like poached eggs. They're\nmy favorite eggs in the whole\nworld.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's good,\" Sol said desperately.\n\"Now why don't you\nbe a good girl and eat your\npoached eggs. In the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ain't ready yet. You going\nto stay for breakfast?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not going to do anything\nuntil you get out of\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  She put the end of a pigtail\nin her mouth and sat down on\nthe chair opposite. \"I went to\nthe palace last night. They\nhad an exelution.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" Sol groaned. \"Be\na good girl, Sally. If you let\nme get dressed, I'll show you\nhow to take your thumb off.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, that's an old trick. Did\nyou ever see an exelution?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Did you ever see a little\ngirl with her hide\ntanned?\"\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Sally!\n   \n  \" Mom again, sterner.\n\"You get out of there, or\nyou-know-what ...\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay,\" the girl said\nblithely. \"I'm goin' to the palace\nagain. If I brush my\nteeth. Aren't you\n   \n   ever\n   \n  gonna\nget up?\" She skipped out of\nthe room, and Sol hastily sat\nup and reached for his\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  When he had dressed, the\nclothes still damp and unpleasant\nagainst his skin, he\nwent out of the parlor and\nfound the kitchen. Mom was\nbusy at the stove. He said:\n\"Good morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Breakfast in ten minutes,\"\nshe said cheerfully. \"You like\npoached eggs?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Do you have a telephone?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the hallway. Party line,\nso you may have to wait.\"\n  \n \n  He tried for fifteen minutes\nto get through, but there\nwas a woman on the line who\nwas terribly upset about a\ncotton dress she had ordered\nfrom Sears, and was telling\nthe world about it.\n  \n \n  Finally, he got his call\nthrough to Salinas, and a\nsleepy-voiced Fred, his old\nArmy buddy, listened somewhat\nindifferently to his tale\nof woe. \"I might miss the\nwedding,\" Sol said unhappily.\n\"I'm awfully sorry.\" Fred\ndidn't seem to be half as sorry\nas he was. When Sol hung\nup, he was feeling more despondent\nthan ever.\n  \n \n  A man, tall and rangy, with\na bobbing Adam's apple and\na lined face, came into the\nhallway. \"Hullo?\" he said inquiringly.\n\"You the fella had\nthe car stolen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  The man scratched his ear.\n\"Take you over to Sheriff\nCoogan after breakfast. He'll\nlet the Stateys know about it.\nMy name's Dawes.\"\n  \n \n  Sol accepted a careful\nhandshake.\n  \n \n  \"Don't get many people\ncomin' into town,\" Dawes\nsaid, looking at him curiously.\n\"Ain't seen a stranger in\nyears.

Come on, you're going with me.\"\n  \n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\n   \n   zilcon\n   \n  wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men\u2014all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n  \n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\n  \n \n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n  \n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n  \n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n  \n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n  \n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard.

        "Summary_1": "The Slider egg is a captivating object that has a clear shell, and light of various colors flash inside it. They are laid by Sliders on Jordan\u2019s planet and are collected by prisoners that are stationed there. The eggs only live for about 4 years, which makes them in demand. If they could be stabilized to live longer they would be even more valuable.\nTheir use is never discussed and the people in the story do not reveal why they are so valuable. Asa is working on a method to keep the eggs alive for longer at the opening of the story, but does not continue in that task during the plot.\n",
        "Summary_2": "\n\tThe Slider egg is a thing of such beauty that the Hazeltyne company that harvests and sells it is one of the most valuable franchises of all the planets. The eggs have a crystal clear shell and albumen, and the yolk is a sparkling network of filaments that flash like lightning. The eggs live for about four years, and their rarity and fading value makes them a luxury item.  The supposed theft of one of these eggs led to the arrest and conviction of Asa Graybar, a biological engineer with the company. Kershaw describes them as sparkling like a million diamonds when they are first pulled out of the mud, and even after spending a year as a muck man, he risks arrest again when he steals a new one that he can\u2019t resist. For his sentence, he chooses to become a muck man again, even though the work is extremely dangerous. The eggs are so valuable as to justify the expense of building a settlement on Jordan\u2019s Planet to harvest them.  \n",
        "Summary_3": "The events of the story are centered around Slider eggs. Sliders are creatures that live in the swamps on Jordan's Planet that have eight flippers on each side of their bodies, and are very protective of their eggs. They feed at nighttime, and consume members of their own species. In contrast, the eggs themselves are like magnificent works of art, with crystal clear shells and yolks that seem to emit electricity. These flashes of light start as the eggs are pulled out of the mud by the humans, and some suspect it is a way for the egg to signal to its mother that it is being handled by someone else. It is the flashes that seem to trigger the Slider attacks that often kill muck men working on the surface. Kershaw's time on Jordan's Planet made him obsessed with these eggs, and drove him to come back after he tried to steal one again. They die over the course of four years and Asa's goal is to find a way to preserve them, so he wants to study them at their source. The reason he is headed to Jordan's Planet is because he was accused (and convicted, though he believes he was framed) of hiding an egg in a lab. These eggs are also the key to the monopoly that Hazeltyne has, as a tycoon on Earth.   ",
        "Summary_4": "The egg is very significant to the story, as Asa was framed and convicted in the first place for his work with the eggs, his decision to undergo changeling conversion is centered around studying the eggs, and his new situation on Jordan Planet is centered around the collecting of slider eggs. Additionally, the eggs are what draw Kershaw into the story, as he was taken in by their allure during his last stint as a muck man, and got arrested again for stealing an egg. The eggs are also the source of wealth for the Hazeltyne Company. The first image the story gives us is a slider egg glittering in Harriet Hazeltyne\u2019s hair. \n"

Retief leaned back and let out a long sigh.\n  \n \n  \"That was close,\" he said. \"I was about out of proverbs.\"\n  \n \n  \"You sound as though you'd brought off a coup,\" Georges said. \"From the\nexpression on the whiskery one's face, we're in for trouble. What was\nhe saying?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a routine exchange of bluffs,\" Retief said. \"Now when we get\nthere, remember to make your flattery sound like insults and your\ninsults sound like flattery, and you'll be all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"These birds are armed. And they don't like strangers,\" Georges said.\n\"Maybe I should have boned up on their habits before I joined this\nexpedition.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just stick to the plan,\" Retief said. \"And remember: a handful of luck\nis better than a camel-load of learning.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire\u2014\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"The Boyars needed some co-operation sixty years ago,\" Retief said.\n\"They tried to get the Aga Kagans to join in and help them beat\nback some of the saurian wild life that liked to graze on people.\nThe Corps didn't like the idea. They wanted to see an undisputed\nanti-Concordiatist enclave. The Aga Kagans didn't want to play, either.\nBut now that the world is tamed, they're moving in.\"\n  \n \n  \"The exigencies of diplomacy require a flexible policy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I want a firm assurance of Corps support to take back to Flamme,\"\nRetief said. \"The Boyars are a little naive. They don't understand\ndiplomatic triple-speak. They just want to hold onto the homes they've\nmade out of a wasteland.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm warning you, Retief!\" the Under-Secretary snapped, leaning\nforward, wattles quivering. \"Corps policy with regard to Flamme\nincludes no inflammatory actions based on outmoded concepts. The Boyars\nwill have to accommodate themselves to the situation!\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of,\" Retief said. \"They're not going to sit\nstill and watch it happen. If I don't take back concrete evidence of\nCorps backing, we're going to have a nice hot little shooting war on\nour hands.\"\n  \n \n  The Under-Secretary pushed out his lips and drummed his fingers on the\ndesk.\n  \n \n  \"Confounded hot-heads,\" he muttered. \"Very well, Retief. I'll go along\nto the extent of a Note; but positively no further.\"\n  \n \n  \"A Note? I was thinking of something more like a squadron of Corps\nPeace Enforcers running through a few routine maneuvers off Flamme.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out of the question. A stiffly worded Protest Note is the best I can\ndo. That's final.\"\n  \n \n  Back in the corridor, Magnan turned to Retief. \"When will you learn\nnot to argue with Under-Secretaries? One would think you actively\ndisliked the idea of ever receiving a promotion. I was astonished\nat the Under-Secretary's restraint. Frankly, I was stunned when he\nactually agreed to a Note. I, of course, will have to draft it.\" Magnan\npulled at his lower lip thoughtfully. \"Now, I wonder, should I view\nwith deep concern an act of open aggression, or merely point out an\napparent violation of technicalities....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother,\" Retief said. \"I have a draft all ready to go.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"I had a feeling I'd get paper instead of action,\" Retief said. \"I\nthought I'd save a little time all around.\"\n  \n \n  \"At times, your cynicism borders on impudence.\"\n  \n \n  \"At other times, it borders on disgust. Now, if you'll run the Note\nthrough for signature, I'll try to catch the six o'clock shuttle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leaving so soon? There's an important reception tonight. Some of our\nbiggest names will be there. An excellent opportunity for you to join\nin the diplomatic give-and-take.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, thanks. I want to get back to Flamme and join in something mild,\nlike a dinosaur hunt.\"\n  \n \n  \"When you get there,\" said Magnan, \"I hope you'll make it quite clear\nthat this matter is to be settled without violence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't worry. I'll keep the peace, if I have to start a war to do it.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief turned. A tall Groacian vibrated his mandibles in a gesture\nof contempt. From his bluish throat coloration, it was apparent the\ncreature was drunk.\n  \n \n  \"To choke in your upper sac,\" the bartender hissed, extending his eyes\ntoward the drunk. \"To keep silent, litter-mate of drones.\"\n  \n \n  \"To swallow your own poison, dispenser of vileness,\" the drunk\nwhispered. \"To find a proper cage for this zoo-piece.\" He wavered\ntoward Retief. \"To show this one in the streets, like all freaks.\"\n  \n \n  \"Seen a lot of freaks like me, have you?\" Retief asked, interestedly.\n  \n \n  \"To speak intelligibly, malodorous outworlder,\" the drunk said. The\nbarkeep whispered something, and two customers came up to the drunk,\ntook his arms and helped him to the door.\n  \n \n  \"To get a cage!\" the drunk shrilled. \"To keep the animals in their own\nstinking place.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've changed my mind,\" Retief said to the bartender. \"To be grateful\nas hell, but to have to hurry off now.\" He followed the drunk out the\ndoor. The other Groaci released him, hurried back inside. Retief looked\nat the weaving alien.\n  \n \n  \"To begone, freak,\" the Groacian whispered.\n  \n \n  \"To be pals,\" Retief said. \"To be kind to dumb animals.\"\n  \n \n  \"To have you hauled away to a stockyard, ill-odored foreign livestock.\"\n  \n \n  \"To not be angry, fragrant native,\" Retief said. \"To permit me to chum\nwith you.\"\n  \n \n  \"To flee before I take a cane to you!\"\n  \n \n  \"To have a drink together\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To not endure such insolence!\" The Groacian advanced toward Retief.\nRetief backed away.\n  \n \n  \"To hold hands,\" Retief said. \"To be palsy-walsy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Groacian reached for him, missed. A passer-by stepped around him,\nhead down, scuttled away. Retief backed into the opening to a narrow\ncrossway and offered further verbal familiarities to the drunken local,\nwho followed, furious. Retief backed, rounded a corner into a narrow\nalley-like passage, deserted, silent ... except for the following\nGroacian.\n  \n \n  Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian\nfell on his back. Retief stood over him. The downed native half-rose;\nRetief put a foot against his chest and pushed.\n  \n \n  \"To not be going anywhere for a few minutes,\" Retief said. \"To stay\nright here and have a nice long talk.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"There you are!\" Miss Meuhl said, eyeing Retief over her lenses. \"There\nare two gentlemen waiting to see you. Groacian gentlemen.\"\n  \n \n  \"Government men, I imagine. Word travels fast.\" Retief pulled off his\ncape. \"This saves me the trouble of paying another call at the Foreign\nMinistry.\"\n  \n \n  \"What have you been doing? They seem very upset, I don't mind telling\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.\"\n  \n \n  Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments\nindicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room. Neither offered a\ncourteous snap of the mandibles, Retief noted. They were mad, all right.\n  \n \n  \"I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr.\nConsul,\" the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. \"May I present\nShluh, of the Internal Police?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" Retief said. They resumed their seats. Miss\nMeuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, it's such a pleasure\u2014\" she began.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Retief said. \"These gentlemen didn't come here to\nsip tea today.\"\n  \n \n  \"So true,\" Fith said. \"Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report,\nMr. Consul. I shall ask Shluh to recount it.\" He nodded to the police\nchief.\n  \n \n  \"One hour ago,\" The Groacian said, \"a Groacian national was brought\nto hospital suffering from serious contusions. Questioning of this\nindividual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a\nforeigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department\nindicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of\nthe Terrestrial Consul.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever heard,\" Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, \"of a\nTerrestrial cruiser, the\n   \n   ISV Terrific\n   \n  , which dropped from sight in\nthis sector nine years ago?\"\n  \n \n  \"Really!\" Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. \"I wash my hands\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Just keep that recorder going,\" Retief snapped.\n  \n \n  \"I'll not be a party\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl,\" Retief said quietly. \"I'm\ntelling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl sat down.\n  \n \n  Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. \"You reopen an old wound,\nMr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial\nhands\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" Retief said. \"That tune went over with my predecessors, but\nit hits a sour note with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"All our efforts,\" Miss Meuhl said, \"to live down that terrible\nepisode! And you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac\nand sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny\nanswers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left.\nSomewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe\u2014at the most. If they were\ninnocent.\"\n  \n \n  \"IF!\" Miss Meuhl burst out.\n  \n \n  \"If, indeed!\" Fith said, his weak voice trembling. \"I must protest\nyour\u2014\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\ncovered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\nwith a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\ngray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\n  \n \n  \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\n  \n \n  The guard blinked at it.\n  \n \n  \"Whassat?\"\n  \n \n  \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\nsays he's out to lunch.\"\n  \n \n  The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\nagainst the handrail.\n  \n \n  \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\nright into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\nwent to his knees.\n  \n \n  \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\npast while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\nover the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\n  \n \n  A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\nalong the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\nThe door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\nfloor. It was expensive looking baggage.\n  \n \n  Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\nflorid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\nthe open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\nclamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\nhe backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\n  \n \n  \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\nout of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\n  \n \n  \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr.\nTony's room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\nsat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\nthe corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\noversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\nglanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n  \n \n  \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\nout?\"\n  \n \n  Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\nhandle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\nthe trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\nfar wall of the corridor and burst.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\nface of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, you must be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If you'll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\nthe door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>The mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n  \n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started\npunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n  \n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll\ntell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in.\nWe're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob\none this way....\"\n  \n \n  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the\ncontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over\u2014one way or another.\"\n  \n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n  \n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n  \n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n  \n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n  \n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n  \n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n  \n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of\nshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the\nping of hot metal contracting.\n  \n<doc-sep>Twenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears\u2014or no ears at all\u2014but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Save the protests, Fith. You have some explaining to do. And I don't\nthink your story will be good enough.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is for you to explain! This person who was beaten\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not beaten. Just rapped a few times to loosen his memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you admit\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It worked, too. He remembered lots of things, once he put his mind to\nit.\"\n  \n \n  Fith rose; Shluh followed suit.\n  \n \n  \"I shall ask for your immediate recall, Mr. Consul. Were it not for\nyour diplomatic immunity, I should do more\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force\npaid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial\ndiplomatic mission.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is an internal matter!\" Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.\n\"The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials. It\nhas outdone itself\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014to keep the Terrestrial consul and his staff in the dark,\" Retief\nsaid. \"And the same goes for the few terrestrial businessmen you've\nvisaed. This continual round of culture; no social contacts outside the\ndiplomatic circle; no travel permits to visit out-lying districts, or\nyour satellite\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Enough!\" Fith's mandibles quivered in distress. \"I can talk no more of\nthis matter\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll talk to me, or there'll be a task force here in five days to do\nthe talking,\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"You can't!\" Miss Meuhl gasped.\n  \n \n  Retief turned a steady look on Miss Meuhl. She closed her mouth. The\nGroaci sat down.\n  \n \n  \"Answer me this one,\" Retief said, looking at Shluh. \"A few years\nback\u2014about nine, I think\u2014there was a little parade held here.

        "Summary_1": "As the story opens, Retief, the Minister to Flamme, is meeting with other members of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne, including Under-Secretary Sternwheeler and Deputy Under-Secretary Magnan. The men discuss Retief\u2019s plan to visit Flamme in person to deal with the growing conflict between the Boyars, who have been living on Flamme for sixty years, and the Aga Kagans. The latter recently arrived on Flamme and began taking over land that the Boyars are farming. The Aga Kagans appear to be goat herders, living in tents and allowing their goats to graze on land that the Boyars use for crops, but in reality, the Aga Kagans have weapons, including 40 mm infinite repeaters and rocket launchers. Retief wants to offer the Boyars the support of the Corps, but Sternwheeler will only go so far as to authorize a \u201cstiffly worded Protest Note.\u201d With foresight, Retief has already drafted a note because he anticipated the Corps would respond with paperwork rather than action. \t\n\tRetief travels to Flamme and meets with Georges Duror, the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime. Georges indicates that he has been holding back his men who want to attack the Aga Kagans for taking their land, and Retief reminds Georges that if the Boyars act without backing from the Corps, they are likely to be destroyed. Retief also tells Georges that the goats and tents are just for show; the Aga Kagans have a modern navy and bullet-proof cloaks, and on their home planet, they travel via modern helis and ground cars. Georges seems discouraged by this news, but Retief reminds him he has the Note and asks him to give diplomacy a chance.\n\tRetief and Georges travel to meet with the head of the Aga Kagans to deliver the Note. On the way, Georges points out the progress that the Boyars have made on Flamme. They stop their air-car when Georges sees a herd of goats in a grain field, and three Aga Kagan horsemen confront them. Retief asks them to take him and Georges to their leader, and they do. Retief introduces Georges as from the Planetary government to the leader, Stanley, and offers to read the Note. He begins with a series of titles until Stanley tells him to skip them. Retief flips two pages and begins a long, legalistic description of relocated people until Stanley cuts him off. Stanley says the Boyars will be accused of imperialism if they attack the Aga Kagans but offers to allow the Boyars to stay until they can make other arrangements. Stanley reveals that the Aga Kagans are slowly creating an empire, and he expects the Corps won\u2019t do anything about it. Georges and Stanley exchange heated insults. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Boyars have spent 60 years terraforming the planet of Flamme, and were assured support from the Corps in their endeavors to colonize the planet from the beginning. A second group, called the Aga Kagan, have begun to move into the planet to do what the Boyars have been told is fishing and homesteading. However, they have landed only males on the planet as well as rocket launchers, suggesting they are mounting an armed takeover.\n\nHigher officials in the Corps (the Under-Secretary) are now walking back their support of the Boyar, to the dismay of Retief - a diplomatic Minister to the planet. Retief has a history of working with the Boyar, and is irritated that the Corps are not willing to be any more engaged in helping them than writing a strongly worded note.\n\nRetief and the Chief d\u2019Regime of the Boyar, Georges, travel on a diplomatic mission via a hovercar to deliver the Note to the Aga Kagan. They encounter a party of three Aga Kagan in the foothills as they travel west, and after a very tense and offensive interaction between the parties are escorted to the leader - Exalted Ruler - of the Aga Kagan, Stanley.\n\nStanley is in an opulent tent being served by slave women that feed and provide for the men. Retief and Georges deliver the Note from the Corps and speak with Stanley largely in proverbs until Stanley persuades them to speak more directly. Georges is hot tempered, and overcome with irritation through the conversation with Stanley about the Aga Kagan moving onto Flamme - ultimately leaving the tent. Retief remains curious about Stanley\u2019s motivations and discovers that he is intent on continuing to invade, no matter the consequences. The story ends with the temper of Stanley flaring up, potentially starting a war on planet Flamme.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Reteif, the Minister to Flamme, approaches an Under-Secretary about the potential invasion that is happening on Flamme. He informs him of the Aga Kagans presence on the planet, and the Boyers very unhappy reaction. He assures the Under-Secretary that he has calmed the Boyers and asked for no action presently, but he wants to know what the Corps will do in response. After delving into the history of the situation--the Corps mainly stays out of the Aga Kagans imperialistic ways--, they reach an agreement to deliver a Protest Note to the Aga Kagans on behalf of the Corps. However, that\u2019s all they will do. \nRetief returns to Flamme and visits with Georges, the Chef d\u2019Regime of the Boyers. They sit in the Governor House, drinking barley whiskey, and discussing the Aga Kagan invasion. Georges informs him of the goat-issue, the ruined oyster patch, while Retief reveals that the Aga Kagan came armed and ready to fight. Georges wants to fight back, but Retief cautions him. Citing the Note, Retief believes they can solve this without any violence. \nThey take off in a car to the Aga Kagans\u2019 territory, past the fertile fields and beautiful lakes. They see goats running through a wheat field, further angering Georges. They are stopped by three Aga Kagans, the leader of which is Blackbeard, and Retief speaks to them in their native language. Using proverbs and confusing language, he gains entry into their camp and the smooth-faced Aga Kagans deliver them to their leader, the Aga Kaga. They are all armed, but Retief advises Georges on how to speak to the leader and reminds him to stick to the plan. \nThey arrive at a large black tent. The Aga Kaga is lounging with several female slaves surrounding him, doting on his every need. He has blue-black hair and he\u2019s very well-dresseed.  they discuss his plans to invade and how they are up for grabs, at least according to the Aga Kaga. The Aga Kaga claims the Boyars are truly the squatters, not his people. They converse in proverbs and diplomatic terms, until Retief brings out the Protest Note. Then they discuss the historical relevance to his conquering ways, and how the Aga Kaga, or Stanley, believes he will win without any protest from the Corps. \nGeorges makes fun of the Aga Kaga, and his words become more and more aggressive. Reteif finds it impossible that the Corps will simply sit back and watch him take over this planet. It\u2019s clear that Retief has some sort of ulteriour motive in this argument. The story ends with the argument evolving into yelling and harsh words. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Two groups, the Boyars and Aga Kagans, are fighting for control of Flamme, a planet the Boyars terraformed. It is up to the humans to act as mediators in this conflict, which they do under the ribbon of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne. Retief, a member of the Corps, wants to give the Boyars official Corps support, but the Under-Secretary is hesitant to say anything too definite and offers to write a note. After the meeting, Magnan invites Retief to a reception later that day with a lot of figure-heads, but Retief wants to get back to Flamme, where he will hopefully keep war from breaking out.  On Flamme, Retief talks to Georges, a Boyar leader. Retief tries to convince Georges to give a diplomatic approach a shot, and advises him on how to proceed. The two of them head out of the capitol, discussing the countryside as Georges expresses his frustration about goats. Retief tries to keep Georges calm and takes his time to unwrap a cigar before he greets the Aga Kagans that approach. After some formalities, Retief explains that they have come to talk with the Aga Kagan leaders. They continue speaking in idioms, but Retief seems to have insulted the Aga Kagans. Retief and Georges eventually make it out of the situation, being led to the Aga Kagan headquarters. Once they arrive, the Aga Kagan known as Blackbeard orders Retief and Georges out of their car, and they are introduced to \"the Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of the East and West\". Then, the discussion in proverbs continues. Retief introduces his friend as \"M. Georges Duror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government\", referring to him as a planetary leader as a power play. This upsets the Aga Kaga, who doesn't consider Georges important. The three eventually sit to discuss the involvement of the Corps, and Retief pulls out the note from the sector's Under-Secretary. Just the statement of titles took at least two pages of the note, and the rest of the note was just as wordy, which frustrated the Aga Kaga, who smugly admitted he had been expecting this complaint. The Aga Kaga, who says to call him Stanley, is thankful that Retief speaks plainly for a diplomat. It turns out Stanley is trying to put up an image for his fellow people but isn't as dedicated to the plan as the others. His primary goal seems to be to live pleasurably while he is alive, but does admit he is there to take over the planet, although he insists it isn't aggressive of him to do. Aga Kaga tries to distract Georges' complaints by admiring his whiskey glass, but threatens the Boyars in the same breath. Retief and Stanley speak in thinly veiled threats citing various historical events, but eventually Retief says that the Corps will be forced to retaliate. It is with this that Georges stands up to defend himself and the story ends with tensions running high. \n"

        "Query": "How do Georges and Retief differ in terms of their positions and knowledge about the Aga Kagans in \"The Desert and the Stars\"?",
        "Article": "The Aga Kaga guffawed. \"For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Have\nanother drink.\" He poured, eyeing Georges. \"What of M. Duror? How does\nhe feel about it?\"\n  \n \n  Georges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. \"Not bad,\" he said. \"But\nnot quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga snorted. \"I thought the goats were overdoing it a bit\nmyself,\" he said. \"Still, the graybeards insisted.

I can tie a knot in an iron bar\nas big as your thumb.\" He popped a grape into his mouth. \"As for the\nrest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childish\nas my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing.

I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial\nself-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation.

Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends.\nAnd I shall continue to take every advantage of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll fight you!\" Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey\nand slammed the glass down. \"You won't take this world without a\nstruggle!\"\n  \n \n  \"Another?\" the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered as\nhis glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent color, don't you agree?\" He turned his eyes on Georges.\n  \n \n  \"It's pointless to resist,\" he said. \"We have you outgunned and\noutmanned.

Before the tent armed men lounged under a pennant\nbearing a lion\n   \n   couchant\n   \n  in crimson on a field verte.\n  \n \n  \"Get out,\" Blackbeard ordered. The guards eyed the visitors, their\ndrawn sabers catching sunlight. Retief and Georges stepped from the\ncar onto rich rugs spread on the grass. They followed the ferocious\ngesture of the bearded man through the opening into a perfumed interior\nof luminous shadows. A heavy odor of incense hung in the air, and the\nstrumming of stringed instruments laid a muted pattern of sound behind\nthe decorations of gold and blue, silver and green. At the far end of\nthe room, among a bevy of female slaves, a large and resplendently clad\nman with blue-black hair and a clean-shaven chin popped a grape into\nhis mouth. He wiped his fingers negligently on a wisp of silk offered\nby a handmaiden, belched loudly and looked the callers over.\n  \n \n  Blackbeard cleared his throat. \"Down on your faces in the presence of\nthe Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of East and West.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Retief said firmly. \"My hay-fever, you know.\"\n  \n \n  The reclining giant waved a hand languidly.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind the formalities,\" he said. \"Approach.\"\n  \n \n  Retief and Georges crossed the thick rugs. A cold draft blew toward\nthem. The reclining man sneezed violently, wiped his nose on another\nsilken scarf and held up a hand.\n  \n \n  \"Night and the horses and the desert know me,\" he said in resonant\ntones. \"Also the sword and the guest and paper and pen\u2014\" He\npaused, wrinkled his nose and sneezed again. \"Turn off that damned\nair-conditioner,\" he snapped.\n  \n \n  He settled himself and motioned the bearded man to him. The two\nexchanged muted remarks. Then the bearded man stepped back, ducked his\nhead and withdrew to the rear.\n  \n \n  \"Excellency,\" Retief said, \"I have the honor to present M. Georges\nDuror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government.\"\n  \n \n  \"Planetary government?\" The Aga Kaga spat grape seeds on the rug. \"My\nmen have observed a few squatters along the shore.

Still, he who\nvisits rarely is a welcome guest. Be seated.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Handmaidens brought cushions, giggled and fled. Retief and Georges\nsettled themselves comfortably.

A perfumed slave girl offered\ngrapes.\n  \n \n  \"Modest ignorance is better than boastful knowledge,\" the Aga Kaga\nsaid. \"What brings the CDT into the picture?\"\n  \n \n  \"The essay of the drunkard will be read in the tavern,\" Retief said.\n\"Whereas the words of kings....\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well, I concede the point.\" The Aga Kaga waved a hand at the\nserving maids. \"Depart, my dears. Attend me later. You too, Ralph.\nThese are mere diplomats. They are men of words, not deeds.\"\n  \n \n  The bearded man glared and departed. The girls hurried after him.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"Let's drop the wisdom of the ages and\nget down to the issues. Not that I don't admire your repertoire of\nplatitudes. How do you remember them all?\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats and other liars require good memories,\" said Retief. \"But\nas you point out, small wisdom to small minds.

They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?\"\n  \n \n  \"Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man,\" Miss Meuhl said stiffly.\n\"He had complete confidence in me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on,\" Retief said, \"I won't\nbe so busy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"May I ask where you'll be if something comes\nup?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. \"Whatever for?\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. \"You've been here on Groac\nfor four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put\nthe present government in power?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure I haven't pried into\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this\nway about ten years back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we\n   \n   avoid\n   \n  with the\nGroaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders\nraking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down\nthe fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one\noccasion.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\n  \n \n  \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,\ngrilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try\nnever to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\"\n  \n \n  \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly not on Groac.\"\n  \n \n  Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I'll be back before\nyou close the office.\" Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim\ndisapproval as he closed the door.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a\nblade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us\nbranded as warmongers? Frankly\u2014is this a closed line?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n  \n \n  \"The tractors are for transshipment.

This is an accommodation\nto a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"\nRetief said. \"Any connection?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n  \n \n  \"Who gets them?\"\n  \n \n  \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy.

I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan\nrepresentative.\"\n  \n \n  \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But\nlook here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang\noff, buzzed the secretary.\n  \n \n  \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new\napplications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement\nof students.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.\nMr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced\nman in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab\nshirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  RETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  by KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Retief knew the importance of sealed\n   \n  orders\u2014and the need to keep them that way!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"It's true,\" Consul Passwyn said, \"I requested assignment as principal\nofficer at a small post. But I had in mind one of those charming resort\nworlds, with only an occasional visa problem, or perhaps a distressed\nspaceman or two a year. Instead, I'm zoo-keeper to these confounded\nsettlers. And not for one world, mind you, but eight!\" He stared glumly\nat Vice-Consul Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Still,\" Retief said, \"it gives an opportunity to travel\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Travel!\" the consul barked. \"I hate travel. Here in this backwater\nsystem particularly\u2014\" He paused, blinked at Retief and cleared his\nthroat. \"Not that a bit of travel isn't an excellent thing for a\njunior officer. Marvelous experience.\"\n  \n \n  He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagram\nappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger disk\nrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating the\ninnermost planet.\n  \n \n  \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers\u2014a\nmere handful of them\u2014have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with\nan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq. I can't think why they\nbother, merely for a few oases among the endless deserts. However I\nhave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to\ntake certain action.\" He swung back to face Retief. \"I'm sending you\nin to handle the situation, Retief\u2014under sealed orders.\" He picked\nup a fat buff envelope. \"A pity they didn't see fit to order the\nTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.\nI'm expected to produce a miracle\u2014a rapprochement between Terrestrial\nand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure\nwould look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.\"\n  \n \n  He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,\" Retief said, \"until the\nTerrestrial settlers arrived.\"\n  \n \n  \"Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.\" Passwyn fixed Retief\nwith a watery eye. \"You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a\ndelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu\nelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at\nSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,\nyou'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less than\nan hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's this native life form like?\" Retief asked, getting to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"When you get back,\" said Passwyn, \"you tell me.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The two men have dealt with each other prior to the events in the story; Retief addresses Georges by his first name, so they know each other fairly well. However, Retief\u2019s position is higher than Georges\u2019s position. Retief works for the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne; Georges works for the Planetary government. Retief knows information about the Aga Kagans that Georges doesn\u2019t know, such as the fact that they are armed, have bulletproof cloaks, and have modern technology on their home planet. He has advised Georges about handling the situation with the Aga Kagans, urging him to prevent the Boyars from attacking the Aga Kagans, and Georges trusts Retief to secure assistance for them. Retief is sympathetic to the Boyars and their situation, trying to persuade Under-Secretary Sternwheeler to support them. When Retief tells Georges that he will personally deliver the Note to the Aga Kagans, Georges wants to help Retief and volunteers to go with him; Retief agrees. It is Retief who develops the plan for handling the Aga Kagans. Georges is impulsive, which leads Retief to keep watch on him. When they encounter the goats in the grain field, Retief has to convince Georges not to hurt the animals, and when the horsemen ride through the grain, Retief has to hold him back again. Retief is calmer in stressful situations and reminds Georges of their strategy: to make their flattery sound like insults and their insults sound like flattery. Georges seems unsure of himself and comments that he should have learned more about their habits before accompanying Retief. Retief has to translate what the Aga Kagans say for Georges in order for him to know what is going on. When the two men meet with Stanley, Retief maintains his calm demeanor, while Georges loses his temper.",
        "Summary_2": "Retief is a diplomatic Minister to Flamme and has strategic plans guiding his desire to see the Boyar continue to inhabit the planet Flamme. Georges is the Chief d\u2019Regime of the Boyar who has an offensive hot temper and hatred of the Aga Kagan that flares routinely while he accompanies Retief to meet with the Aga Kagan. In this way, their contrasting approaches to interacting with the Aga Kagan are a very suspenseful part of the story.\n\nThe two of them desire a similar outcome - for the Boyar to continue to inhabit Flamme and for the Aga Kagan to leave. Georges and Retief have had a history of working together that provides a sense of camaraderie between them, and Retief desires to help Georges achieve his goals on the planet.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Retief is the Minister to Flamme, a very diplomatic position. Georges is the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime, the Boyers\u2019 leader and governor. Retief is a quirky man. His progressive nature and strong morals force him to attempt to save Flamme from the Aga Kagans invasion. However, his manner of doing so is sneaky and tricky, using proverbs to establish himself and make his way to the Aga. Georges, on the other hand, is a little more hot-headed. Although he has been patient so far in waiting for Retief\u2019s aid, he wishes to destroy the invaders and is struggling to hold back his men. When they confront the Aga Kaga, Retief takes the diplomatic approach, while Georges essentially yells at him. Although Georges may be the leader of the Boyers, Retief is the one who devises the plan and leads them to the Aga Kaga. ",
        "Summary_4": "Georges, the Boyar Chef d'Regime, has been on the planet Flamme for sixty years, overseeing its terraforming. He is understandably frustrated with the moves that the Aga Kagans are making on the territory of Boyar, and is upset at the amount of damage that the Aga Kagans are causing, as it took a long time to terraform the planet to make it what it is today. Retief is willing to get involved in the issue and backs Georges up but he goes with the flow, acting as a calm source of energy in the political sphere. It is Retief that works to convince Georges that he should consider a diplomatic approach to handling the situation, and travels to the Corps himself to make sure this is an option. Georges gets frustrated easily, as we see with the goats, and Retief is there to calm him down and remind him of the demeanor that will give him a better chance at the negotiating table. Retief speaks Kagan and is well-versed in their cultural norms, which is very useful for the purposes of negotiation. It also makes him very adept at making the Aga Kagans angry, which he does as soon as they encounter each other. On a more surface level, they are members of different groups of people, but they both hold some kind of political status within their groups respectively. "

All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls.

I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story\u2019s beginning takes place at the headquarters for the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne where Retief works, but the rest of the story takes place on the planet Flamme. Sixty years earlier, the Boyars settled on Flamme and set about making it suitable for farming by clearing the jungle, descumming the seas, irrigating the deserts, and setting out forests. For sixty years, the Boyars inhabited the planet by themselves, with only the saurian wildlife presenting a danger to them. Flamme is now a thriving planet. It has a Government House with comfortable lounge furniture, waiters in white jackets, colorful flowers, a lake, a lawn, and colorful flowerbeds. It also has beautiful sunsets. Outside the capital, there are rolling hills of granite. Flamme\u2019s main industry seems to be agriculture; fifty years ago they had bare rock, but they bred special strains of bacteria that broke the rock down to soil where they raised legumes and then grains. The Boyars also have oyster breeding beds. There are roads, although they have pot-holes, and air-cars for transportation. The Aga Kaban headquarters is a large black tent featuring air conditioning and a pennant featuring a lion \u201ccouchant in crimson on a field verte.\u201d It has the smell of incense, and someone is playing stringed instruments inside. There are colorful decorations in gold, blue, silver, and green. The Aga Kaba are accustomed to the finer things in life; Stanley even blows his nose on silk cloth. Their foods include grapes, oranges, and bananas, and their beverages include whiskey. Everything about the Aga Kaba\u2019s leader\u2019s tent suggests wealth and luxury.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on the planet of Flamme, which has been terraformed over the last sixty years into a habitable landscape for crop culture and fishing. It opens in the Corps offices where Retief meets with the Under-Secretary.\n\nRetief travels to a fancy government house of the Boyar Chief d\u2019Regime, Georges, that includes a waitstaff and an expansive verandah.\n\nThe diplomatic party travels eight miles west of the capital in a black official air-car flying twin flags of Chief of State and Terrestrial Minister. It continues on some unknown distance through granite hills to the opulent tent of the Exalted Ruler of the Aga Kaga. The tent is outfitted with rich rugs, stringed instruments playing and female slaves serving the men. The rest of the story takes place in this tent.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Much of The Desert and the Stars by Keither Laumer takes place on a previously barren, uninhabitable planet made fertile by the Boyars. After almost 100 years dedicated to terraforming the planet Flamme, the Boyars finally succeeded in making the planet habitable. With very advanced technology, they made the ground ripe and fertile, wheat stalks and barley floating in the wind. Oysters lie in the pools of water, and the great boulders and rock formations that will soon be eroded by a special bacteria will eventually host more crops. Their sunsets are striking and colorful, with beautiful poplar trees and well-maintained flower beds. \nRetief stays at the Government House with Georges, the Boyar Chef d\u2019Regime. The house overlooks a lake and is surrounding by beautiful gardens. \nThe Aga Kagans have taken over more of the rocky areas, introducing goats into the ecosystem. Their unwanted presence takes away from the belabored beauty that the Boyars created. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Most of the story takes place on Flamme, a planet occupied by the Boyars, the people who terraformed it, but more recently also occupied by the Aga Kagans. There is also a presence of the people from Earth, who work under the umbrella of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne. In the capital city of Flamme, the view from the Government House is gorgeous, with various trees and flowers planted that seem to glow in the purple and red sunset of the planet. Outside of the capital, among the hills, it is less beautified and the streets have potholes. This area used to be covered entirely in rock, but the hills were created by the terraforming and fertilization technology of the Boyars. There are a lot of goats on these hills now, because of the Aga Kagans, and past this area there are stretches of sand and other green areas, which is where the Aga Kagan leaders are. \n"

Presumably my world\nwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\nit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\nstructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\nforty feet high.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n  \n \n  \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n  \n \n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\nplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\nTaphetta.\n  \n \n  \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n  \n \n  And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\nor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\natomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\nfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\naggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\naloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\nwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve turned the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse ran back\nto the old man and gave him his canteen, turning away before it could be\nrefused and striding quickly back to the unicopter and getting himself\nairborne without looking at the deserted village or the old man again.\n  \n \n  The old man's voice called after him: \"Tell the people ... hurry ...\nKumaji looking for them to kill ... desert wind ought to wipe out their\ntrail ... but hurry....\"\n  \n \n  The voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind.\nSteve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on\nhate-haze. He circled wider and wider, seeking his people.\n  \n \n  Hours later he spotted the caravan in the immensity of sand and\nwasteland. He brought the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and\na whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the\nslow-moving column. It was like something out of Earth's Middle\nEast\u2014and Middle Ages. They had even imported camels for their life here\non the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel was a better beast of\nburden than anything the Sirius II wastelands had to offer. They walked\nbeside the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with\nthe swaying baggage of their belongings. They moved through the sands\nwith agonizing slowness. Already, after only one day's travel, Steve\ncould see that some of the people were spent and exhausted and had to\nride on camelback. They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five\nhundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them....\n  \n \n  \"Hullo!\" Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding\nclumsily through the sand toward him. \"Cantwell's the name,\" Steve said.\n\"I'm one of you.\"\n  \n \n  Bleak hostility in his face, the man approached. \"Cantwell. Yeah, I\nremember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh,\nno. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing\nhere now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?\"\n  \n \n  The bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias\nWhiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a\nboy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in\nhis eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in\nhis mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was\nwell-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a\nbig muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had\nhardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve\nCantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the\nKumajis, and had grown rich\u2014by colony standards\u2014at his business. Now,\nSteve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the\nothers\u2014either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a\nnew colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation.\nPerhaps that explained his bitterness.\n  \n \n  \"So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.\"\n  \n \n  The refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.\nThey hardly seemed to be moving at all. \"Is my aunt all right?\" Steve\nsaid. She was the only family he remembered.\n  \n \n  Tobias Whiting shook his head slowly. \"I hate to be the one to tell you\nthis. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died\nfrom the poisoned water last night.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was\npity\u2014pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death.\nSadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness.\n  \n<doc-sep>They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection\u2014and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n  \n<doc-sep>Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That\nwas from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first\ndisappointments.\n  \n \n  He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four\nyears old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange\nlonging....\n  \n \n  \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on\nthe screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing\nthrough fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n  \n \n  \"According to plan, the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  has reached its furthest point from\nEarth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more\nstars and stellar systems\u2014but hope is small that any of those will\nprove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined\nalready.\n  \n \n  \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have\nonly, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the\nUniverse, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead\nalong the Milky Way.\n  \n \n  \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the\nglobular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars\nthere in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's\nneighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But\nOmega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n  \n \n  \"Even so\u2014by expending its remaining fuel freely, the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  could\nachieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility\nof aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey\u2014even if enough\nfuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after\nmore than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and\nperhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n  \n \n  \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according\nto the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization\u2014if the\nother expeditions failed also\u2014will have reached a dangerously unstable\nphase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from\noverpopulation.\n  \n \n  \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about\nEarth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a\ndecree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be\nforgotten back there?\n  \n \n  \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know\u2014some of them still show signs\nof homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that\nwas once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n  \n \n  Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then\nhe sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n  \n \n  The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake\nhim. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them\nonce in translation from the ancient English....\n  \n \n  ... for my purpose holds\n  \n \n  To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n  \n \n  Of all the western stars, until I die.\n  \n<doc-sep>The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod?

I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes.

A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The history of Flamme itself is of great relevance to its value to both the Boyars and the Aga Kagans. When the Boyars settled the planet sixty years ago, it was habitable but unable to support much agriculture. They have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme, clearing jungles, descumming seas, irrigating deserts, and planting forests. Fifty years ago, the Boyars learned how to breed a special strain of bacteria that breaks down the granite that covered much of the surface. The granite breaks down to soil, and the Boyars add broad-spectrum fertilizer to make the land arable. The Boyars now have many fields of crops and are continuing to develop new sections for more. Their many years of intensive work in creating farming land and growing crops gives them a vested interest in their settlement.\nThe Aga Kagans are involved in empire-building. They have sent what appear to be goat herders and fishermen to Flamme to begin taking over the land. The goat herders are all male and have rocket launchers. They present a false appearance as homesteaders who lack access to modern technology; in reality, their tents are high-polymer plastic, and their robes are bullet-proof. On their home planet, they have helis and ground cars. The homesteaders set up camp in the middle of farm fields, allow their goats to graze on the crops, and cook their sheep\u2019s brains over dung fires. The fishermen are actually the Aga Kagan navy who come equipped with 40 mm infinite repeaters. The CDT knows that the Aga Kagans have been using this same method of invasion for the past five years in six other worlds. The Aga Kagans hide their modern technology in the places they are invading to dupe the people they are intruding on and to please the older conservatives in their government. \nThe Aga Kagans\u2019 approach to empire-building is based on their knowledge of Earth history. While their society has modern technology, their false appearance of third world trappings can be used to justify their invasions into \u201cmore advanced\u201d societies. Stanley admits the Aga Kagans move into an area after others have done the hard work of building the community and civilization so that the Aga Kagans can enjoy the fruits of the others\u2019 labors. By appearing to be a third world civilization, the Aga Kagans can defend their actions and gain empathy with a claim of \u201clegitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly exploited peoples.\u201d Stanley also acknowledges his familiarity with empire-builders on Earth and claims he won\u2019t make their mistake of going \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d He couches their approach as \u201can ancient and honorable custom\u201d and references Mein Kampf, the Communist Manifesto, and Leung\u2019s the Porcelain Wall. Based on the histories of the men behind these works, Stanley knows that the CDT will follow the practice of appeasement and allow the Aga Kagans to make their little land-grabs until they are positioned so that they cannot be stopped.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Stanley manipulates a historically exploited group, the Aga Kagan, to gain power. Stanley appears to be interested in exploiting whatever means necessary to acquire such power, and has positioned himself as the Exalted Ruler of the Aga Kagan to do so. He speaks negatively about the Aga Kagan and their elders which he pays lip service to, but ultimately executes his own strategies that may or may not be in line with the historical actions of their people. Stanley uses the history of the Aga Kagan as formerly exploited people to place the Corps into a complicated diplomatic situation to get his way that he relishes in and laughs about during the diplomatic visit from Retief and Georges.",
        "Summary_3": "The leader of the Aga Kagans uses history as a way to justify his actions and prove to himself and others that he will face little to no resistance in the process. He references colonial imperialism, colonization, and some of the most hated figures in history as his predecessors. By relying on the Corps silence, he truly believes that he will be able to conquer Flamme, destroy the Boyars, and do all this without any humanitarian uprising. \nBy taking it slow and biding their times, the Aga Kagans will acquire their empire slowly but surely. Based on previous knowledge, the Aga truly believes that the Corps will simply accept their invasion, so long as they don\u2019t move too quickly. He cites Hitler, Leung, and Stalin as references: these people moved too far too fast. \nHistory also sets up the present conflict. Sixty years earlier, the Corps encouraged and asked the Boyars to terraform Flamme and transform it into something beautiful. The Boyars did so, believing the Corps wwere on their side. Now, half a century later with the Aga Kagans encroaching on their territory, the Boyars are waiting for their previously promised Corps support and coming up empty. Interestingly enough, the Boyars asked the Aga Kagans to co-settle Flamme with them, but both the Corps and the Aga Kagans refused. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Flamme had been a wasteland, but was terraformed by the Boyars. The planet itself has a lot of history, which is part of the current conflict. The Aga Kagans had not wanted to help terraform the planet, but now that the hard work was done over many decades, they wanted to move in. History also plays a role in communication more generally. The Aga Kagans communicate in proverbs, which act as idioms referencing specific historical events. The Aga Kagans are also familiar with the history of other cultures, and aim to control the narrative of the history of various planets, deciding who is considered a warmonger versus labeling their own takeovers in a positive light. The Aga Kaga knows a lot about the history of Earth as well, and cites a number of historical events to Reteif during their impassioned discussion, along with names of famous historical manifestos. The Aga Kaga tries to use these historical events as points in an analogy, much like the proverbs his people communicate with regularly.  "

        "Query": "What is the significance of the Aga Kagans in THE DESERT AND THE STARS and how do they operate?",
        "Article": "The Aga Kaga guffawed. \"For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Have\nanother drink.\" He poured, eyeing Georges. \"What of M. Duror? How does\nhe feel about it?\"\n  \n \n  Georges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. \"Not bad,\" he said. \"But\nnot quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga snorted. \"I thought the goats were overdoing it a bit\nmyself,\" he said. \"Still, the graybeards insisted. And I need their\nsupport.\"\n  \n \n  \"Also,\" Georges said distinctly, \"I think you're soft. You lie around\nletting women wait on you, while your betters are out doing an honest\nday's work.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga looked startled. \"Soft? I can tie a knot in an iron bar\nas big as your thumb.\" He popped a grape into his mouth. \"As for the\nrest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childish\nas my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing. As for\nmyself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the end\none will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my years\nare numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well,\nhunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to others\nthe arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.\"\n  \n \n  \"You admit you're here to grab our land, then,\" Georges said. \"That's\nthe damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, ah!\" The Aga Kaga held up a hand. \"Watch your vocabulary, my\ndear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial\nself-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Or\npossibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly\nexploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition,\nan activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle of\nColonial Imperialism.\"\n  \n \n  \"Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notorious\nplanet-grabbers in Sector history, you\u2014you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Call me Stanley.\" The Aga Kaga munched a grape. \"I merely face the\nrealities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter of\nhistorical association. Some people can grab land and pass it off\nlightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely for\nholding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends.\nAnd I shall continue to take every advantage of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll fight you!\" Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey\nand slammed the glass down. \"You won't take this world without a\nstruggle!\"\n  \n \n  \"Another?\" the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered as\nhis glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent color, don't you agree?\" He turned his eyes on Georges.\n  \n \n  \"It's pointless to resist,\" he said. \"We have you outgunned and\noutmanned.

Reports, reports,\nreports\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not criticizing the reporting system, are you, Mr. Magnan?\" the\nUnder-Secretary barked.\n  \n \n  \"Gracious, no,\" Magnan said. \"I love reports.\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems nobody's told the Aga Kagans about fiscal years,\" Retief\nsaid. \"They're going right ahead with their program of land-grabbing on\nFlamme. So far, I've persuaded the Boyars that this is a matter for the\nCorps, and not to take matters into their own hands.\"\n  \n \n  The Under-Secretary nodded. \"Quite right. Carry on along the same\nlines. Now, if there's nothing further\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you, Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan said, rising. \"We certainly\nappreciate your guidance.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is a little something further,\" said Retief, sitting solidly in\nhis chair. \"What's the Corps going to do about the Aga Kagans?\"\n  \n \n  The Under-Secretary turned a liverish eye on Retief. \"As Minister\nto Flamme, you should know that the function of a diplomatic\nrepresentative is merely to ... what shall I say...?\"\n  \n \n  \"String them along?\" Magnan suggested.\n  \n \n  \"An unfortunate choice of phrase,\" the Under-Secretary said. \"However,\nit embodies certain realities of Galactic politics.

At that time a\nfoothold against Neo-Concordiatist elements was deemed desirable. Now\nthe situation has changed.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Boyars have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme,\" Retief said.\n\"They've cleared jungle, descummed the seas, irrigated deserts, set out\nforests. They've just about reached the point where they can begin to\nenjoy it. The Aga Kagans have picked this as a good time to move in.\nThey've landed thirty detachments of 'fishermen'\u2014complete with armored\ntrawlers mounting 40 mm infinite repeaters\u2014and another two dozen\nparties of 'homesteaders'\u2014all male and toting rocket launchers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Surely there's land enough on the world to afford space to both\ngroups,\" the Under-Secretary said. \"A spirit of co-operation\u2014\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Quite alone,\" the Aga said. He nodded sagely. \"Yes, one need but read\nthe lesson of history. The Corps Diplomatique will make expostulatory\nnoises, but it will accept the\n   \n   fait accompli\n   \n  . You, my dear sir, are\nbut a very small nibble.

They went too far, too fast.\"\n  \n \n  \"The confounded impudence,\" Georges rasped. \"Tells us to our face what\nhe has in mind!\"\n  \n \n  \"An ancient and honorable custom, from the time of\n   \n   Mein Kampf\n   \n  and\nthe\n   \n   Communist Manifesto\n   \n  through the\n   \n   Porcelain Wall\n   \n  of Leung. Such\ndeclarations have a legendary quality. It's traditional that they're\nnever taken at face value.\"\n  \n \n  \"But always,\" Retief said, \"there was a critical point at which the man\non horseback could have been pulled from the saddle.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Could\n   \n  have been,\" the Aga Kaga chuckled. He finished the grapes and\nbegan peeling an orange. \"But they never were. Hitler could have been\nstopped by the Czech Air Force in 1938; Stalin was at the mercy of the\nprimitive atomics of the west in 1946; Leung was grossly over-extended\nat Rangoon. But the onus of that historic role could not be overcome.\nIt has been the fate of your spiritual forebears to carve civilization\nfrom the wilderness and then, amid tearing of garments and the heaping\nof ashes of self-accusation on your own confused heads, to withdraw,\nleaving the spoils for local political opportunists and mob leaders,\nclothed in the mystical virtue of native birth. Have a banana.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're stretching your analogy a little too far,\" Retief said. \"You're\nbanking on the inaction of the Corps. You could be wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I shall know when to stop,\" the Aga Kaga said.\n  \n \n  \"Tell me, Stanley,\" Retief said, rising. \"Are we quite private here?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, perfectly so,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"None would dare to intrude in\nmy council.\" He cocked an eyebrow at Retief. \"You have a proposal to\nmake in confidence? But what of our dear friend Georges? One would not\nlike to see him disillusioned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't worry about Georges. He's a realist, like you. He's prepared to\ndeal in facts. Hard facts, in this case.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga nodded thoughtfully. \"What are you getting at?\"\n  \n \n  \"You're basing your plan of action on the certainty that the Corps will\nsit by, wringing its hands, while you embark on a career of planetary\npiracy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Isn't it the custom?\" the Aga Kaga smiled complacently.\n  \n \n  \"I have news for you, Stanley. In this instance, neck-wringing seems\nmore in order than hand-wringing.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga frowned. \"Your manner\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind our manners!\" Georges blurted, standing. \"We don't need any\nlessons from goat-herding land-thieves!\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga's face darkened. \"You dare to speak thus to me, pig of a\nmuck-grubber!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Star Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Garrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n  \n \n  \"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n  \n \n  \"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n  \n \n  \"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\n  \n \n  Star twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\n  \n \n  It was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\n  \n \n  He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\n  \n \n \n \n  And Devil Garrett died.\n  \n \n  There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\n  \n \n  And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\n  \n \n  Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\n  \n \n  Two of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\n  \n \n  The other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\n  \n \n  There was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n  \n \n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n  \n \n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the\nstars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion\nof it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n  \n \n  He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're\nlooking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is\ntoday and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,\nfor purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.\nThere was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky\nWay is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain\ntogether, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we\ncalculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n  \n \n  Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped\nthe motion.\n  \n \n  \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n  \n \n  There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly\nequal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't\nclose, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n  \n \n  Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n  \n \n  \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n  \n \n  \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are\nhumans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate\nwith those they were adjacent to\n   \n   two hundred thousand years ago\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"\nmurmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that\nsatisfies the calculations?\"\n  \n \n  \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something\nthat might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a\nrepresentative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have\nother ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other\nmammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.\nThe evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the\ntime right.\"\n  \n \n  Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two\nends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n  \n \n  \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic\nlight-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a\nfast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our\nexploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it\nthis trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the\nvisionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\n\"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n  \n \n  \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd\nbetter ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n  \n \n  Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn\nwas the most advanced human type present, but while there were\ndifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't\nas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in\nthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\nlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\nthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and\nthis was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some\nrespect.\n  \n \n  The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of\nyour pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give\nhim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four\nmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\nus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\nhave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\nwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to\nhave an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\nability.\"\n  \n \n  Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\nplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency\nsuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\nthe incentives?\"\n  \n \n  Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the\nRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\ncent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the\nprofits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n\"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\nyou'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound\nroll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n  \n \n  They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n  \n \n  \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take\nyou all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that\nI'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly\neverywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.\"\n  \n \n  There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the\nintegrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n  \n \n  \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it\nfor me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his\nribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the\nregion toward which we're heading.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Aga Kagans are an empire-building society that has been increasing their presence in six other worlds by the time they appear on Flamme. The Aga Kagans send in men disguised as goat herders and fishermen who are actually armed and equipped with modern accessories. The Aga Kagans have a plan to build their empire by invading other worlds following the model of Adolf Hitler, but they plan to avoid his mistake of moving \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d The Aga Kagan leader, Stanley, is well-educated and a manipulator. He plays to the older conservative Aga Kagans by allowing the third-world trappings of goat herders to be used while he actually has disdain for their traditional values, but his charade gives him what he wants. The Aga Kagans wait until an area has done the hard work of building its civilization and becoming sustainable before he moves his men in. Although the CDT is aware of the Aga Kagans\u2019 actions, it wants to avoid warfare and meets the intrusions with diplomacy, but all the while, the Aga Kagans are ensconcing themselves for a permanent takeover of the places where they have intruded.\n",
        "Summary_2": "In the story, the Aga Kagan are portrayed as antagonists to the Boyar. They appear to be manipulated by Stanley into actions that may no longer be entirely in line with the beliefs of the Aga Kagan elders.\nThe Aga Kagans are a group that has been moving onto the planet Flamme for the past five years. They\u2019ve landed military equipment that suggests they are willing to move in violently if necessary, but have not yet been met with resistance from the Boyar who have been living on the planet for sixty years. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Aga Kagans are a conquering people, known for their planet-grabbing tendencies. They have currently set up shop on the Boyer-populated planet, Flamme. After the Boyers spent 60 years redoing the planet and making it fertile and inhabitable, the Aga Kagans swooped in and are plotting an extremely slow invasion. They arrived with long robes and goat-skin tents, as well as lots and lots of goats. However, these robes and tents are actually made out of a special bullet-proof material. The goats were just for show. \nWith an incredible arsenal, an army of \u201chomesteaders,\u201d and armor to match, the Aga Kagans are fully prepared to invade the Boyers. They are the antagonist of the story, especially their leader, the Aga Kaga or Stanley, as he likes to be called. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Aga Kagans seem to be making a move on the territory that the Boyars consider theirs. The Aga Kagans making a claim on this land could be an act of war, and the Corps wants to avoid a war as much as possible. They ruin some of what the Boyars have created, including an oyster breeding bed. They're on at least six planets and have spent at least the past five years trying to expand their territories. In this way, they act as the antagonists of the story, as a group that presents a challenge for the Boyars and the people from Earth to work against. "

Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,\nstudied Wayne with abstract interest.\n  \n \n  \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you couldn't execute them?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"The psycho you only wounded. He's a five-times murderer. And that girl\nkilled her father when she was twelve. You realize there's nothing can\nbe done for them? That they have to be executed?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too bad,\" the doctor said. \"We all have aggressive impulses, primitive\nneeds that must be expressed early, purged.

        "Summary_1": "Peter Matheny is a Martian sociodynamics professor sent to Earth on behalf of the Martian government under the guise of hiring an Earthman who can help manage and improve their export business. Armed with a hundred million dollars, his real mission is to find and enlist the service of a con man who can help the Martians concoct a securities scheme that will net greater profits than their current exports yield (the government hired him because of his experience formulating the Red Ankh Society scheme, which offered to sell bogus wisdom of the Old Martians). Peter is accustomed to the largely-empty deserts of Mars and enjoys the serenity of smoking a pipe while stargazing behind his small home in addition to other quiet hobbies such as reading, playing chess, and collecting minerals. When he arrives on Earth, he feels out of his element and uncomfortable due to the heavy, humid air and massive towers and neon lights he encounters in the crowded city, so he seeks a place where he can sit. He finds a place called \"The Church of Choice,\" where, to his delight, he discovers a number of gambling games in progress despite the ban on such activities on Earth. Because the Martian Constitution specifically allows for gambling, Peter partakes and shoots a successful game of craps. However, he expresses confusion about Earth rules for craps, since the Martian version employs a number of tricks and cheats. After the game, Peter feels uncomfortable again and tries to leave, but he is stopped by a man named Gus Doran, who takes him out for drinks. During their conversation, Peter tells Gus about the struggles of the Martian economy and explains how high Earth taxes and greedy middlemen have cut into the profits from their exports. Over the course of a few more drinks, Peter tells Gus about several frauds the Martians developed in an effort to bolster their economy and accidentally reveals his true intentions for visiting Earth to Gus. This information intrigues Gus who informs Peter that he has contacts that may be able to help. To ensure Peter's trust, Gus uses an oath box and promises not to tell anyone what he learned from Peter that night. Gus then suggests they celebrate by inviting some women to their hotel, and he leaves to make a phone call. He calls his business partner Peri, who is preparing to go on a date with a wealthy marijuana rancher. Gus convinces her to cancel the date and join him at the hotel so that together they can take advantage of Peter's amenability and hustle him out of a million dollars.",
        "Summary_2": "Peri tries to look sexy as she answers the visiphone and realizes it\u2019s Gus Doran on the other end. Gus is unhappy to hear that Peri has a date scheduled with a wealthy Indonesian man, and he tries to convince her to go out with a Martian instead. The Martian has a hundred million dollars available to freely spend, and Gus wants Peri to get some of that cash. She agrees.\n\nPeter Matheny arrives at the United Protectorates on Earth and shows his paperwork to enter the country. He is there on a recruiting mission, and the official advises him to head to the rural areas because no one in the cities would ever leave Earth. Peter walks through the city and wonders why he has been given this assignment. He\u2019s a professor of sociodynamics, and although he has advised the Martian government before, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s equipped for the gig. He is supposed to find a con man that will work on Mars.\n\nPeter enters the Church of Choice and begins to gamble even though it\u2019s illegal on Earth. When he tries to pick his chips up, he is reminded that he\u2019s not really gambling. He\u2019s at church! Peter is embarrassed and relieved when Gus comes up to him and asks him to have a drink. Gus asks Peter about his background as an Earthman on Mars, and Peter provides Gus with information about why the Martians are so poor and all of the rackets and taxes that make living there and making a livable wage difficult. He explains that he\u2019s on Earth to find someone that can help the Martian people figure out how to appeal to Earthmen to bring in some capital to the red planet. After a few alcoholic drinks, Peter admits that Mars needs a true con-man that can make them lots of money. Gus offers to give Peter some of his acquaintances\u2019 contact information so that he may make some connections. \n \nGus suggests that the two men go get a hotel room, and they book a room at the Jupiter-Astoria. While there, Peter confesses that he wants to tell Gus more about his mission, but he can\u2019t unless Gus promises to keep everything a secret. They call room service for an oath box, and Gus agrees to keep everything hush-hush. Afterwards, Peter admits that the only way the Martians currently make money is through cons. Instead of selling precious Martian relics, they actually just manufacture them at scale and lie to consumers about their value. He also confesses that Junie O\u2019Brien, a little Martian girl who was dying, was a ploy to get Earthmen to send them money. Finally, he reveals that the Red Ankh Society, a group that claims to have knowledge handed down from the Old Martians, is also a con. Gus says that he may have just the right person for this job, but first they need to call the girls and celebrate. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Matheny is a college professor on Mars who is sent to Earth on a diplomatic mission to find a con man to run a con game for the planet so that it can make a lot of money, but his cover story is that he is looking for a business manager for Martian trade. Unbeknownst to him, an Earth con man, Gus Doran, has learned of his arrival and his expense budget of one hundred million dollars and plans to get at least one million dollars from him. He contacts his associate, Peri, a sultry blonde who has luxurious gifts from men she dates, and makes plans for her to be Peter\u2019s date that evening. Matheny first enters The Church of Choice where parishoners can \u201cEnter, Play, and Pray.\u201d It offers gambling, a restaurant, and a bar. He plays a crap game and draws attention when he continually rolls a seven; he thinks the game hasn\u2019t started but has been winning over and over. When Matheny leaves the table, Gus Doran introduces himself and reminds Matheny he left his chips on the table, then invites him for a drink. Matheny appreciates Doran\u2019s company, and the two discuss tourism between Earth and Mars. Matheny focuses on the Martian economy and the need to build it up by attracting more Earth dollars. Mars makes very little money on its exports due to taxes, shipping fees, and so forth, and few tourists from Earth go there because they know the air is harder to breathe, and there are no big cities with entertainment venues, just small towns, villages, and ranches amidst scrub and desert. Mars has dabbled in multiple business ventures to make money, but most have yielded little profit. Matheny tells Doran that what Mars really wants is to operate a sweepstakes. Doran keeps Matheny drinking beer and wins his confidence until Matheny tells him his real purpose, to find someone to run a world-size con game. Doran checks Matheny into the Jupiter-Astoria and arranges for Peri to come to the room, and he tells Matheny he has some contacts who can help him find the person he needs. He even orders an oath box from room service, takes the pill, and puts on the conditioner helmet; then he states the oath that he will not tell anyone what Matheny tells him. Matheny tells him that the current Martians are already running a con game; they built their \u201cancient\u201d ruins for the Billingsworth Expedition to find and manufacture the relics they sell. He also tells Matheny about another con, a little girl on Mars who was a mathematical prodigy but dying of an incurable disease. She collected Earth coins, and sympathetic people sent a billion dollars. The \u201clittle girl\u201d is now their finance minister, and her incurable disease was aging. He also admits the Red Ankh Society is a modern creation. Doran says he thinks he can help Matheny find his con man. \n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Esteemed-escort, Peri, is dressing for a date with Mr. Sastro when she receives a call from Gus Doran. He informs her of a Martian who will pay even more than this heir may and who\u2019s a little unfamiliar with Earth terms. After some bickering, she agrees on 500,000 for payment and calls off the date. Moving backward in time, Peter Matheny arrives on Earth and is questioned by the passport official. He gives him a half-truth and quickly moves on. Matheny was sent to Earth to hire a conman for Mars. Mars has been struggling financially for years now, and their biggest economic ploys are all schemes. \nMatheny stands out on Earth, unaccustomed to the gravity and air here. As well, his clothes are 40-years out of style and mark him as a Martian. Being a professor, Matheny isn\u2019t entirely sure why sent him, but he did devise the Red Ankh Society, one of their schemes. He enters the Church of Choice and decided to play a game of crap. He wants to play for money, but the other churchgoers ward him off. He leaves embarrassed and runs into Gus Doran who brought him his chips. They grab a drink at Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, but not before Matheny had already blabbed about half his business. Doran covers the drinks: a beer for Matheny and a whiskey sour for himself. They drink and talk about the Martian economy and how their goods may be pricey, but the real profit is nowhere near as high. Matheny, a little tipsy, tells Doran that they\u2019re looking for an Earth executive, someone who\u2019d make a hundred megabucks a year on a five-year contract. He mentions as well that he has extra money for expenses on Earth, which draws Doran in. Doran reveals he has connections, so Matheny tells him they need a con man. \nThey leave for the Jupiter-Astoria where they encounter sexual chairs. Doran suggests they get a girl, most likely with Peri in mind, and he tells Matheny to get some new clothes. Doran tells Matheny again he has contacts, so Matheny makes him swear under an oath box before he will reveal their true secrets. After, Matheny tells him about their schemes, from the Red Ankh Society to Junie O\u2019Brien. Doran thinks he has the man for Matheny, but first, he suggests going to the bar to celebrate with a girl. \n"

        "Summary_1": "There are several locations where key events in the story take place including Peri's residence, the immigration office, the Earth city, the Church of Choice, Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, and the Jupiter-Astoria hotel. In addition, at various points throughout the narrative, Peter recalls life on Mars, which is covered with deserts and scrub thorn and an atmosphere with drier air and lesser gravity compared to Earth's humidity and strong gravitation. Martian society is largely rural with very small towns and villages, and their weeks are different than those on Earth; they have a day called \"Tenthday\" when Peter likes to play poker with his coworkers, and he sometimes visits a place called Swindletown. Peter often notes the differences between Earth's commercialism and reliance upon automation and Mars' more calm, individualistic society. Peter is overwhelmed by the bright, neon lights, massive towers, and sheer amount of vehicles and people in the city where he arrives on Earth and longs for his small cottage and rock garden back on Mars. To navigate the city, Peter takes cabs, and to access the different levels of the towers, he utilizes the ramp system. Looking for a place to sit, Peter finds The Church of Choice, which seems to be an establishment where people can drink and gamble, although gambling is illegal on Earth. The Church of Choice features craps tables, roulette wheels, and even Bingo and has a large, marble lobby at its entrance that leads into a number of dim rooms with Gothic architecture. After meeting Gus there, the two leave and share drinks at Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar & Grill, a place where diners can talk in private sitting at soundproof booths while enjoying a strip show. The carpeted hotel room he shares with Gus at the Jupiter-Astoria has a pneumatic device that can deliver drinks straight from the bar along with anything else someone may require, such as the oath box Gus uses to cement Peter's trust in him. There is also a bathroom and a \"sexy type of furniture\" that operates like a massage chair.",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on a city on Earth. Peter Matheny, a college professor, arrives from Mars to find a con-man that can help make Mars a more economically viable place to live. The city on Earth is a shock to Peter. It has neon lights, enormous crowds, and people wearing brightly colored pajamas on the streets. The sky is impossible to see because of the pollution, and the hundreds of buildings are incredibly tall. \n\nPeter refers to Earth as the \"greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen,\" and everywhere he turns he sees businesses that make loads of money and people opening up their wallets for a good time. People appear only in groups, and they are very organized as if their only true purpose is to band together and collect capital. \n\nPeter goes to the Church of Choice hoping to gamble, but he quickly learns that although the place sells chips like a true gambling parlor, it's all for fun. Later, Peter checks into the Jupiter-Astoria hotel and is impressed by the sexy furniture and expensive-looking fixtures. \n\nEarth is essentially the exact opposite of Mars, where people live in small cottages and have a difficult time making money. There are no major businesses other than the cons that the embassy creates like children with fake diseases that need to collect money for their medical services and mass manufactured Martian relics. \n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on Earth in the hot, humid month of August. Men wear colorful clothes and are described as looking like\u201ca rainbow\u201d dressed in pajamas and the women as wearing Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats. There is a lot of traffic, and in larger cities, there are multi-colored towers half a mile high that block the stars and moon. Gambling is illegal, but churches make gambling available. There is a lively entertainment industry with nightclubs, bars, strip clubs, etc., in large cities like Newer York. There are provincial, less industrialized regions as well, such as Russia and Congolese Belgium, which some people refer to as the sticks.   \t\nOn Mars, life is more peaceful. Matheny enjoys the quiet rock garden behind his cottage where he can smoke his pipe with Orion for company\u2014when the temperature isn\u2019t too far below zero. People who live there have changed to have longer legs and an expanded chest as a result of the gravity, and the atmosphere makes it harder to hear sounds. Mars has a civilized society with universities, a central government, and specialized organizations such as the Red Ankh Society. Mars lacks much of the technology that exists on Earth, specifically the automation to bring any service you want to you on a twenty-four-hour basis. On Mars, gambling is legal, in part because it relieves the sheer boredom of the deserts. People cheat, and organizations offering gambling have systems that astute players can figure out. Matheny frequently mentions that Mars has a dollar shortage or is poor and suggests that Earth should send tourists to Mars, but Doran points out that the people who do go to Mars come back and complain that there is barely enough air to survive there and that there are no cities, just small towns, villages, and ranches. The landscape is mainly dust, sand, and thorn scrub. Mars needs equipment and supplies from Earth. Whatever Mars exports to Earth requires enormous costs to ship, and after wholesalers and retailers, salespeople, advertisers, and taxes are paid, there is very little profit left. The planet is able to produce paper products, such as postcards, travel posters, and books. It has resorted to con schemes to make more money.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on Earth, far into the future where some humans have already begun to colonize Mars. This new Earth is outfitted with modern technology and some Martian goods, like thyle. Gambling and other immoral acts are illegal, though they are not on Mars. The air is much heavier on Earth than Mars, and people tend to travel in packs. Busy and crowded, the city never sleeps and is filled to the brim with stylish people. \nOne scene takes place in the Church of Choice, which has a restaurant upstairs and play-gambling to the left. All chips purchased are contributions to the church, and the games feature crap, bingo, and other card games. At the bar, Doran and Matheny are seated in a noise-controlled section, where curtains block out most other sounds, ensuring their privacy. The Jupiter Astoria faces beautiful tall towers, and it houses chairs that are designed to wrap around those sitting in them. \n"

Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A\nhell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance\nbusiness consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange\nsome contacts....\n  \n \n  \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary\nfriendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now.

It\nwill take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean....

He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,\nthat's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can\njust blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n  \n \n  Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off\nor something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time\nmarijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,\neven a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,\nsee? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official\nbusiness, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me\nwhat the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the\nsolar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n  \n \n  Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a\nhundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit\nhis accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,\nlegal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about\nas much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to\nhave experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be\nlike taking candy from a baby.\"\n  \n \n  Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and\ncream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between\nangle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other\nplans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this\none night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a\nmillion is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an\nawful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me\nstrangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth\nseemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an\nodd quality.\n  \n \n  \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb\nout of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some\ngaiety.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room\nfirst and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Allez\n   \n  ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean\n   \n   allons\n   \n  , or maybe\n   \n   alors\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered\nhim; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.\n  \n \n \n   Oh, well\n   \n  , he thought,\n   \n   if I succeed in this job, no one at home will\nquibble.\n   \n \n \n  And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular\nenough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to\nshow the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n  \n \n  \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down.

He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but\nhis face burned. \"I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered\nhimself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a\ncigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not\ntoo late to catch them at home.

He is short, chisel-faced, has slicked-back hair, and wears blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell cloak, and slippers. When the story begins, Peri is preparing to go on a date with the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. who is also a wealthy marijuana rancher, supposedly to use him for money. Gus convinces her to change her plans to help him swindle Peter since he has discovered Peter has a hundred million dollars at his disposal and appears to be susceptible to Gus's charming and manipulative ways. Gus goads Peter into confessing his secret by providing him with beer and akvavit and gains his trust by wearing the helmet attached to the oath box. At the end of the story, Gus agrees to help Peter find his confidence man by utilizing his network of underworld contacts, but instead calls Peri to begin implementing his con.",
        "Summary_2": "Gus is a con-man who works with a woman named Peri. He uses his natural charisma to speak to men with money and try to get them to call Peri to have a little fun with her. His research and his ability to talk to all kinds of people puts her in touch with wealthy individuals that spend a lot of money on her. She then splits the profits with Gus. Gus introduces himself to Peter because he seems out of place at the Church of Choice. He can tell by his old clothes and height that he is a Martian, and he acts as though he is genuinely interested in learning about Peter's life on Mars and his business mission. The reality is that Gus sees that Peter is an oddball and decides to learn more about him in case he would make a good victim. Through his conversations with Peter, he learns that he is working for the Martian government, and he decides to hook Peter up with Peri so that they can take advantage of Peter's naivety. ",
        "Summary_3": "Gus Doran is a confidence man on Earth. He knows Peri and uses her \u201cservices\u201d for individuals with a lot of money whom he thinks he can use for his own personal gains. He interacts directly with the \u201cmark\u201d to gain the man\u2019s confidence, lower his defenses, and trick him into giving part of his money to Doran. At the story\u2019s beginning, Doran arranges for Peri to be available for the Martian diplomat with the hundred million dollar expense account. Doran intends to win the man\u2019s confidence and then bilk him of one million dollars. Gus \u201cmeets\u201d Peter Matheny, the diplomat from Mars, at the gaming tables of the church and invites him to have a drink. Gus wins Matheny\u2019s confidence so that Matheny reveals the dollar deficit that Mars is experiencing and the planet\u2019s desire to hire a manager to help it build up its tourist industry. One way Gus builds this confidence is through empathetic responses. Matheny reveals that while Mars produces vermouth that is bought and served on Earth, he can\u2019t stand the stuff. Gus responds that he can\u2019t stand the stuff either but has always been afraid to admit it. Matheny explains that Mars has very little profit after paying the engineers, salespeople, advertisers, and Earth taxes on its exports, and Gus acts as if he is a small-time business consultant and says maybe he can help Matheny, all the while planning to take Matheny\u2019s money. When Matheny suggests there is more he could tell him, Gus offers to use an oath box, swallows the pill, and dons the helmet to confirm that he is honest and trustworthy. When Matheny eventually admits that Mars wants a con man to run a worldwide con, Gus indicates he can help him find someone to do it.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Gus Doran is an Earthman who just happens to know a lot of Earthmen. He runs into Peter Matheny, a visiting Martian, and soon realizes that he can have a hell of a time with this guy. Doran serves as Matheny\u2019s tour guide and takes him to a bar and a hotel where he can stay. When he realizes that Matheny is looking for an Earthman to serve as an executive for Mars (essentially a conman), he sees potential there. Once he realizes that Matheny has millions of dollars to spend on expenses here, he sees even more potential there. Doran propels Matheny forward and takes this slightly lost Martian on a wild journey. As well, he promises Matheny that he knows someone who could be the perfect person for this position. Doran also knows Peri, an escort, who will presumably make an entrance later on in the story. "

If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

Any little mining company or transport\nfirm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few\ndollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter\nas security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.\nBut who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more\nof. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political\nmalcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of\nliberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics\nhope to get from Mars?\"\n  \n \n  \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n  \n \n  \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n  \n \n  \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary\nfreight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n  \n \n  Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n  \n \n  \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very\nfrank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n  \n \n  Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to\nevery economist.\"\n  \n \n \n   Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for\ninstance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our\nneed; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough.\n   \n \n \n  The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a\nwhiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the\nMartian.\n  \n \n  \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"A pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with\nthe situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, we're not\n   \n   that\n   \n  poor! My expense allowance assumes I will\nentertain quite a bit.\"\n  \n \n  Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,\nthen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business\nmanager for the Martian export trade.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault\nthere are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et\ncetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>I listened to all this in silence. \"But,\" I said when she had finished,\n\"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine\nlaborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie frowned. \"I'm not sure I can answer the first of those\nquestions,\" she replied. \"You must remember Antlers Park has been on\nthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted\nhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n  \n \n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens\nbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master\ncontrolling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners\nwere in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would\nbe susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you\ncoming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Coming with you?\" I repeated. \"Where?\"\n  \n \n  The old lady lit a cigarette. \"Pluto maybe,\" she said. \"There's a penal\ncolony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new\ncrime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,\nfugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....\"\n  \n \n  \"Grannie,\" I laughed. \"You're incorrigible!\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who\nopenly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n<doc-sep>All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly.

        "Summary_1": "The Red Ankh Society is a con devised by Peter for the Martian government as a way to boost their economy. People paid for the exclusive privilege of access to the secrets and ancient wisdom of the Old Martians; in reality, these were just bogus semantics compiled for the sake of earning large amounts of money. However, the existence of the Red Ankh Society reveals quite a bit about Mars, the role of cons in the story, and even Peter himself. During Peter's discussion with Gus, we learn the Martians are descended from Earthmen who preferred greater freedom than was offered by the United Protectorate and moved to Mars to establish a life there. They work to make the planet habitable and attractive to tourists, but the process is slow because they cannot afford the equipment and power plants required to build on a scale that will attract the necessary amount of visitors needed to turn a profit. This leads the government to resort to drastic measures; they wield their skills at playing tricks and cheating at gambling (they even have a city called Swindletown) to implement a number of schemes meant to draw in vast amounts of cash such as the Red Ankh Society, the construction and sale of phony ancient relics and ruins, and the saga of Junie O'Brien (a little girl whose fake illness raised a billion dollars for the planet). This leads the government to send Peter to Earth in order to purchase the services of a con man who can help implement a new scheme to sell Martian securities. This trip introduces Peter to Gus, who begins work on a plan to swindle Peter out of a million dollars.",
        "Summary_2": "The Red Ankh society is one of may cons that Peter has come up with to help the Martian government make money. The Society claims to have secret knowledge from ancient aliens, and people who purchase a membership into the Society can get their hands on the information that the old Martians had. Peter admits that he himself came up with this con, and although it has made some money for the planet, it just isn't enough. The Martian embassy is looking for an Earthman who can help the Martians trick the other Earthmen into investing in Mars or perhaps creating a tourist industry there, although there's really nothing worth seeing. The Red Ankh Society is emblematic of the way the Martians make money: by tricking Earthmen into believing that Mars is mysterious and interesting and purchasing items that truly hold no value. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Matheny, a sociodynamics professor at Devil\u2019s Kettle University, is the person who came up with the idea for the Red Ankh Society, which was established as a money-making venture for Mars, and he was selected for the mission to Earth because of this idea. The Society advertises that it can pass on the \u201cmysterious knowledge\u201d of the Old Martians and possesses the \u201csecret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens.\u201d The organization is a fake, but it has become the top dollar-earning business on Mars. While Mars lags behind Earth in its earning capacity, this organization generates more money for Mars than any other business. This scam is just one of several that Mars has used to make money.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Red Ankh Society was a ploy developed by Peter Matheny to bring more capital to the Martian Nation. This scheme involved producing advertisements, both visual and auditory, that told stories of the Ancient Aliens of Mars. This older generation supposedly had lots of wisdom to share with a select audience. The Red Ankh Society was only available to the few people willing to pay the steep price for it to uncover more secrets about the ancient Martians. This Society is significant because it is one of the reasons the Martian government chose creator Peter Matheny for this job on Earth, and it shows what schemes and ploys the Martians must come up with in order to make money.

        "Article": " \n  INNOCENT AT LARGE\n  \n \n  By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WOOD\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course\n    \n   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared\n    \n   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble!\n   \n \n \n \n  The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.\nShe peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of\ntranslucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or\nhad it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.\nThen she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked\nwith a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely\non top and tight around the hips.\n  \n \n  After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n  \n \n  She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"\nshe said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just\ntaking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n  \n \n  Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered\nin awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date\ntonight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must\nhave heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,\nthat's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can\njust blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n  \n \n  Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off\nor something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time\nmarijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,\neven a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,\nsee? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official\nbusiness, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me\nwhat the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the\nsolar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n  \n \n  Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a\nhundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit\nhis accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,\nlegal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about\nas much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to\nhave experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be\nlike taking candy from a baby.\"\n  \n \n  Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and\ncream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between\nangle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other\nplans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this\none night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a\nmillion is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an\nawful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief.

He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling\ninto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n  \n \n  \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n  \n \n  \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that was three years ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her\neyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self\nconscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw\nyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a\nheap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about\nfour miles,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" he said.\n  \n<doc-sep>  \"Any problem posed by one group of\nhuman beings can be resolved by any\nother group.\" That's what the Handbook\nsaid.

        "Summary_1": "Peri is Gus Doran's business associate along with someone named Sam Wendt. The three of them operate an enterprise centering on Peri's ability to attract rich and powerful men and swindle them for cash. Peri has golden blonde hair and silver-blue eyes and a light complexion, and she has a private phone number she gives to men involved in the group's schemes. At the beginning of the story, she wears a dinner gown as she prepares to go on a date with a marijuana rancher, who is also the heir apparent to Indonesia, Inc. When she receives a phone call, she changes from her gown into a more casual bathrobe, thinking one of her many suitors is calling her and wants to make him feel special. However, the casualness of the bathrobe is misleading as it is worth thousands of dollars and was given to her by a representative of the Antarctic Enterprise. She even tousles up her coiffed hair to complete the image. When she realizes it is only Gus Doran calling, she grows impatient and drops her facade. On the call with Gus, she learns of his introduction to Peter Matheny, and together they agree on a scheme to extort a million dollars from him. Gus wants to split the cash evenly between the three of them, but Peri insists on fifty percent for her share. She cancels the date with the marijuana rancher and prepares to go meet Gus and Peter at the Jupiter-Astoria.",
        "Summary_2": "Peri is Gus's girl, and she makes money for herself and for him by making rich men feel important and worthy of her time. When she first enters the story, she is barely dressed in a robe and purposefully places some blond hair in front of her eyes to look demure for a video call. Although she already has a date with a wealthy man scheduled for that evening, she changes her mind when Gus tells her that he has a Martian who's holding millions of dollars and wants to see her. Gus originally offers Peri one-third of the takeaway, but she insists that she gets half of the pot of money. Gus makes the connections with the wealthy guys, but it's Peri who ultimately takes advantage of them and gets them to fork over their money. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peri seems to be a high-class call girl who collaborates with others to scam men out of their money. She has a casual bathrobe which cost several thousand dollars and was given to her by either the president of Antarctic Enterprise or the chairman of the board; she has had so many \u201cdates\u201d that she has difficulty keeping them straight. When her visiphone chimes, she preps herself to look sultry, slipping out of her dinner gown and into the robe, fixing her hair just so, and making sure the robe is loose around the top and tight around the hips. When she answers the call, she says she is sorry to keep the caller waiting but that she was just taking a bath; this suggestive information is meant to lure in her caller. The caller is Gus Doran, who is her scam associate. He tells her that she has a date that night with a backwoods Martian, a man who lacks sophistication but who has come to Earth as a Martian diplomat with a large expense budget of one hundred million dollars. Peri tells Gus that she is having dinner with the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. Gus tells Peri he thinks they can get one million dollars from the Martian and states Peri\u2019s cut will be one-third of that. Peri interrupts him and states that her share will be half a million dollars and that she has a headache that will prevent her from seeing the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. After Gus \u201cbefriends\u201d the Martian diplomat and earns his trust, he gets the Martian drunk and suggests inviting a girl he knows to help them celebrate their upcoming business arrangement of a con man to work for Mars; the girl is Peri. We can assume she will help Gus make his deal that will provide a million-dollar payout that they will split. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Peri is a highly-esteemed and very expensive escort, based on her clothing alone. The casual bathrobe she puts on to answer a call probably cost several thousand dollars. Although she was supposed to meet with Mr. Sastro tonight, the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc. and marijuana rancher, Doran persuades her to meet with Matheny instead. She is drawn in by Matheny\u2019s excessive funds for his visit to Mars. She and Doran come up with a plan called \u201cBadger,\u201d which involves another fellow called Sam Wendt, presumably to steal all of Matheny\u2019s money. Peri is the escort promised to Matheny by Doran, and presumably a con-woman herself. "

        "Query": "What is the story of The CONJURER of VENUS and how does it involve Jonny Johnson and Vee Vee?",
        "Article": "  The CONJURER of VENUS\n  \n \n  By CONAN T. TROY\n  \n \n \n   A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\n    \n   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\n    \n   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories November 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n  \n \n  \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n  \n \n  \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   are\n   \n  beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n  \n \n  \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n  \n \n  \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n  \n \n  For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers\nsought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He\ncaught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened\nand became a rock.\n  \n \n  Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light\nhad been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the\nimpassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three\nhundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe\nthat would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the\nspotlight as if by magic.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n  \n \n  No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n  \n \n  Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound\npassed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself\nflat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently\nwent to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest\ntake on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n  \n \n  The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers\ndug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for\nprotection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She\ndrew closer to him.\n  \n \n  A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able\nto take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was\nsuddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she\nhad suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n  \n \n  Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer\nlay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his\nbreath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation\nwas senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he\nsensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this\nway, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these\nRooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself\nwas not prepared to disagree.\n  \n \n  Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...\ngoing.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience\nto them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n  \n \n  The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,\nperhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music\nand the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else\nthat sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium\nsmokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.\nHe was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...\n  \n \n \n   watching a space ship float in an endless void\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into\nhis vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,\nthe sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and\nCaldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not\nin the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he\nknew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out\non the periphery of his universe, perhaps of\n   \n   the\n   \n  universe.\n  \n \n  All he saw was the space ship.\n  \n \n  It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen\nin his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n  \n \n  Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off\nstars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his\ndestiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was\nthis night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n  \n \n  The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and\nthrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now\nhe was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n  \n \n  He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who\nwas Vee Vee?\n  \n \n  The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship\nvanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,\nat Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n  \n \n  \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on\nhis arm.\n  \n \n  \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n  \n \n  \"See what?\"\n  \n \n  \"The space ship!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.\n\"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact\nwith my dream.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your dream?\"\n  \n \n  He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,\nand look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of\nsound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left\ntold him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The\nVenusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat\nof hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a\nhigh-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had\nnot heard it before in this place.\n  \n \n  He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n  \n \n  The vision would not come.\n  \n \n  He shook his head and tried again.\n  \n \n  Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a\nwoman in love.\n  \n \n  He tried again for the space ship.\n  \n \n  It would not come.\n  \n \n  Anger came up instead.\n  \n \n  Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept\nintruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n  \n \n  So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not\ndreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n  \n \n  His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n  \n \n  Cold flowed over him.\n  \n \n  Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n  \n \n  The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here\nand there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to\nVenus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.\nAnother voice took its place.\n  \n \n  \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...\nthis is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian\nDreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,\ncan float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n  \n \n  \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.\nWe are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian\nBuddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n  \n \n  \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n  \n \n  \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our\nmaster saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some\nother sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n  \n \n  \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n  \n \n  A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if\nthe parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to\nhim what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days\nwhen he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n  \n \n  \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n  \n \n  The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,\nMaster! Do something.\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n  \n \n  \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,\nif action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we\ncan all die.\"\n  \n \n  \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go\ntogether.\"\n  \n \n  The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the\nlittle voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n  \n \n  \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n  \n \n  \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n  \n \n  \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see\nthem. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that\nforce. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n  \n \n  \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a\nVenusian being jarred out of his dream.\n  \n \n  \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n  \n \n  A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n  \n \n  Unger fell.\n  \n \n  He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,\nbody-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n  \n \n  There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The\nsilence went. Voices came.\n  \n \n  \"Who did that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked\nthe voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the\nmeaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At\nhis left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was\nback in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as\nif some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n  \n \n  On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up\naround his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came\nhungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n  \n \n  \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back\nof the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of\nVenusians were attacking a man.\n  \n \n  \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He\n   \n   is\n   \n  here!\"\n  \n \n  In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired\nblindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft\nthrob of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\nStruck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But\nthere seemed to be an endless number of them.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had\nslid out of his sight.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n  \n \n  \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important\none.\"\n  \n \n  Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.\nJohnson followed.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\nnotions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in an\natom's eyebrow.

What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look!

Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n  \n \n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters.

The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\ningredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n  \n \n  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\nsmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and\nthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\nMartians or Venusians.\n  \n \n  Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it\nwas the dead man's hand.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Coma esta, senor?\n   \n  \" a small voice piped. \"\n   \n   Speken die Deutsch?\nDesirez-vous d'amour? Da?

I guess I was about ten when\nWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,\nI think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\nI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n  \n \n  I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\nproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\nconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made\na hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was a\nterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n  \n \n  But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n  \n \n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  \n \n  I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  \n \n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n  \n \n  He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n  \n \n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, I mean\n   \n   real\n   \n  heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be\ndangerous, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\n  \n \n  I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\n  \n \n  He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?\nWhat have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\n   \n   nobody\u2019s\n   \n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n  \n \n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n   \n   how\n   \n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n  \n \n  I wanted to be along.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Jonny Johnson is one of Earth\u2019s foremost scientists, but no one on Venus is supposed to know that. He and another man, Caldwell, have come looking for another human named Martin, and it would be quite dangerous for him and them if anyone knew they were there. Johnson enters a bar known for providing patrons with dreams, and meets a gorgeous and dangerous woman named Vee Vee. \n\nVee Vee attempts to use a tactic known as the Karmer nerve paralysis on Johnson, which he swiftly blocks. They enter the Room of the Dreamer together, even though they don\u2019t trust each other (and Caldwell has tipped off Johnson to watch out for her because she has been asking about Martin). As they enter the room and Johnson and Vee Vee lob threats back and forth, she reveals that she knows who he is but says she will keep his secret. \n\nThe Dreamer, Unger, enters the room and the dreaming commences. It seems to affect everyone, including Johnson, who sees a spaceship and then is upset that he can\u2019t get it back. He has the odd sensation of different bodily organs speaking to him and trying to convince him what he\u2019s seeing is real as he watches Unger levitate high into the air. \n\nUnger falls, hard, and the crowd gets very upset and murmurs suggest a human is at fault. Vee Vee suddenly kisses Johnson, saying she might not be able to later. He is puzzled by this, until he sees that Martin is in the room and the crowd is converging on him. Johnson and Caldwell fire their effective but not fatal zit guns into the crowd as Johnson calls out Vee Vee\u2019s name and Caldwell tells him to forget about her. As the passage ends they are trying to get through the frantic throng of people to reach Martin. \n",
        "Summary_2": "John Michael Johnson and Caldwell are scientists from Earth that are attempting to undertake a covert mission on Venus to locate Martin. They believe he can be found at a Venusian theatrical experience called the dreaming, whereby a room full of people are led into a dream state by a Venusian named Unger. \n\nJohnson and Caldwell pretend not to know each other, and Caldwell keeps watch over Johnson - tapping out messages to him in code on the bar top so they can communicate from a distance. Caldwell detects sinister intentions of Vee Vee and tries to warn Johnson repeatedly as she joins Johnson and he begins to be swept up by her captivating beauty and manipulations. Johnson has flashes of concern that VeeVee may be planted by someone who suspects the intentions that he and Caldwell have at the bar, but he dismisses those thoughts.\n\nVee Vee forces Johnson into the dreaming spectacle to take place that evening in a dark theatre within the bar. She attempts to disable Johnson using the Karmer grip, but is astonished when he is able to break it. Despite her confident influence over Johnson, she becomes scared and clings to Johnson through the dreaming. \n\nHumans fall into the dream state more reluctantly than Venusians, and Johnson wakes out of his dream of a ship to see that Unger is levitating above the floor at the center of the room. This is a huge discovery for him that he can hardly believe. Within his body, he experiences a surge of readiness to action, but this is abruptly broken by another human interrupting the dreaming. Martin has broken Unger\u2019s dreaming session, toppling Unger to the floor from a height and waking all the other dreamers who are furious. VeeVee kisses Johnson and leaves rapidly while the theatre goers break into violence and Caldwell and Johnson start firing their stun weapons around the room trying to apprehend Martin before he escapes.\n",
        "Summary_3": "An Earthman named Johnson walks through rain-filled Venus to get to the bar. Johnson is after a genius named Martin, and he and his colleague Caldwell have traveled to Venus to find him.  He enters, hearing rhythmic music and sensing the feelings of those around him. Caldwell is in the bar as well, but they pretend they don\u2019t know each other. Johnson orders a tarmur from a Venusian waiter and asks about the dreams. Unger, a great dreamer, will be performing tonight, so Johnson asks the waiter to come back and ask again later. Johnson sits down at the bar and enjoys his green beverage. A girl sits down next to him: tan, scantily clad, with blue eyes and brown hair, and a fabulous necklace. Instantly, Johnson feels both attracted and worried for her. She was not safe here in this bar, even on this planet, dressed like that. They flirt, and she introduces herself as Vee Vee, after stating that she is not a child. Johnson cannot figure out why she is on this planet. He wonders if she was sent to monitor him because the Venusians suspected his mission, but he quickly brushes that off because he would\u2019ve been killed already had they figured it out. \nCaldwell rushes next to Johnson, pretending to be drunk and disorderly, and informs Johnson that Vee Vee knows who Martin is, the man that they\u2019re searching for. Vee Vee and Johnson decide to attend the dreaming, but on their way to the room, she attempts to paralyze him using the Karmer nerve block. He gets out of it and injures her in the process. This confirms her theory that he is John Michael Johnson, esteemed human scientist. Caldwell follows them into the Room of the Dreamer. \nThe room is heavily perfumed and filled with cushions and rugs for people to lie on. The music gets louder as the room gets darker. Vee Vee holds onto Johnson as Unger suddenly appears in the center of the room. He lies down to sleep, and soon everyone follows after him. The Venusians first, humans last. Johnson thinks he notices a pattern in the room, but he finally drifts off and sees a spaceship, the one he dreamt of as a boy. Vee Vee woke him up, but he was unable to return to sleep due to the high-speed whirring sound. He saw Unger levitating ten feet above the ground and couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Perhaps Johnson starts dreaming again, or maybe he\u2019s hallucinating, either way, his body starts speaking to him as his mind sees Unger. A Venusian awoke from their dream, and a human\u2019s cry caused everyone else to wake up. Suddenly, Unger dropped back to the ground. \nEveryone tries to figure out who disturbed the Dreaming. Fingers point to Martin, who was there after all. Vee Vee quickly kisses Johnson and then disappears. Caldwell and Johnson pull out their non-lethal zit guns and shoot at the crowd who were trying to attack Martin. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Johnson, a scientist from Earth, has traveled to Venus in search of a missing Earth scientist named Martin. He goes to an entertainment venue where patrons can have liquor, women, or dreams. An associate, Caldwell, is already there, it seems they have an agreement not to acknowledge each other\u2019s presence. Johnson orders a drink at the bar, and a young woman joins him and strikes up a conversation. Johnson is surprised to see such a young, beautiful woman alone in the bar because it isn\u2019t safe. She introduces herself as Vee Vee, and Johnson begins to suspect that the Venusians are using her to get to him; he knows that they would kill him if they knew his purpose. Caldwell comes to the bar to place an order, and his fingers tap nervously on the bar top; Johnson interprets the taps as a message warning him about the girl because she was asking about Martin earlier. Vee Vee comments about Caldwell\u2019s apparent drunkenness and calls him Johnson\u2019s friend. Johnson denies knowing him, but Vee Vee accuses him of lying. Vee Vee accompanies Johnson to the dreaming, and while she is holding his arm, she uses a move   on himcalled the Karmer nerve paralysis. Recognizing what is happening, Johnson hits her shoulder, breaking her grip, and Vee Vee is astonished because he is the first man she knew who could break it. Johnson warns her not to try it again, and she says she doesn\u2019t make the same mistake twice, and the second time she breaks her victim\u2019s neck. She claims she will use Eve\u2019s way to get to him next. She addresses Johnson by his name and says his ability to break the Karmer nerve grip confirmed his identity for her. They move to the dreaming room, select a spot, and settle on some cushions; Caldwell settles next to them. The music plays and perfumes fill the air. Eventually a spotlight shines in the center of the room, and the famous dreamer Unger appears. When he settles in to sleep, everyone in the room begins dreaming their own dreams. Johnson wakens and notices a whirring sound that seems familiar but from a different place; he can\u2019t restart his dream and sees Unger\u2019s body levitating upward. Johnson becomes hyperaware of his organs and imagines they are talking to him, and his adrenals tell him they are making adrenalin, and his pancreas is preparing him for action. Someone yells out, woken from his dream. Unger\u2019s body drops to the floor from a height of ten feet. A Venusian claims a human broke the dreaming, and pandemonium breaks loose. Vee Vee kisses Johnson and disappears, and Johnson and Caldwell see the Venusians attacking Martin and start shooting them with their zit guns.\n\n\n"

        "Query": "In the story \"The CONJURER of VENUS\", who is the protagonist named Johnson and what happens to him?",
        "Article": "  The CONJURER of VENUS\n  \n \n  By CONAN T. TROY\n  \n \n \n   A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\n    \n   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\n    \n   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories November 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n  \n \n  \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n  \n \n  \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   are\n   \n  beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n  \n \n  \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n  \n \n  \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n  \n \n  For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee. Like Topsy, I just grew.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers\nsought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He\ncaught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened\nand became a rock.\n  \n \n  Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light\nhad been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the\nimpassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three\nhundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe\nthat would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the\nspotlight as if by magic.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n  \n \n  No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n  \n \n  Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound\npassed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself\nflat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently\nwent to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest\ntake on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n  \n \n  The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers\ndug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for\nprotection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She\ndrew closer to him.\n  \n \n  A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able\nto take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was\nsuddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she\nhad suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n  \n \n  Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer\nlay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his\nbreath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation\nwas senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he\nsensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this\nway, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these\nRooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself\nwas not prepared to disagree.\n  \n \n  Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...\ngoing.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience\nto them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n  \n \n  The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,\nperhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music\nand the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else\nthat sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium\nsmokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.\nHe was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...\n  \n \n \n   watching a space ship float in an endless void\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into\nhis vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,\nthe sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and\nCaldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not\nin the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he\nknew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out\non the periphery of his universe, perhaps of\n   \n   the\n   \n  universe.\n  \n \n  All he saw was the space ship.\n  \n \n  It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen\nin his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n  \n \n  Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off\nstars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his\ndestiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was\nthis night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n  \n \n  The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and\nthrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now\nhe was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n  \n \n  He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who\nwas Vee Vee?\n  \n \n  The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship\nvanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,\nat Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n  \n \n  \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on\nhis arm.\n  \n \n  \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n  \n \n  \"See what?\"\n  \n \n  \"The space ship!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.\n\"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact\nwith my dream.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your dream?\"\n  \n \n  He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,\nand look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of\nsound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left\ntold him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The\nVenusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat\nof hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a\nhigh-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had\nnot heard it before in this place.\n  \n \n  He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n  \n \n  The vision would not come.\n  \n \n  He shook his head and tried again.\n  \n \n  Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a\nwoman in love.\n  \n \n  He tried again for the space ship.\n  \n \n  It would not come.\n  \n \n  Anger came up instead.\n  \n \n  Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept\nintruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n  \n \n  So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not\ndreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n  \n \n  His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n  \n \n  Cold flowed over him.\n  \n \n  Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n  \n \n  The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here\nand there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to\nVenus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.\nAnother voice took its place.\n  \n \n  \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...\nthis is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian\nDreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,\ncan float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n  \n \n  \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.\nWe are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian\nBuddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n  \n \n  \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n  \n \n  \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our\nmaster saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some\nother sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n  \n \n  \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n  \n \n  A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if\nthe parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to\nhim what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days\nwhen he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n  \n \n  \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n  \n \n  The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,\nMaster! Do something.\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n  \n \n  \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,\nif action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we\ncan all die.\"\n  \n \n  \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go\ntogether.\"\n  \n \n  The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the\nlittle voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n  \n \n  \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n  \n \n  \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n  \n \n  \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see\nthem. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that\nforce. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n  \n \n  \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a\nVenusian being jarred out of his dream.\n  \n \n  \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n  \n \n  A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n  \n \n  Unger fell.\n  \n \n  He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,\nbody-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n  \n \n  There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The\nsilence went. Voices came.\n  \n \n  \"Who did that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked\nthe voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the\nmeaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At\nhis left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was\nback in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as\nif some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n  \n \n  On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up\naround his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came\nhungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n  \n \n  \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back\nof the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of\nVenusians were attacking a man.\n  \n \n  \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He\n   \n   is\n   \n  here!\"\n  \n \n  In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired\nblindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft\nthrob of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\nStruck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But\nthere seemed to be an endless number of them.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had\nslid out of his sight.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n  \n \n  \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important\none.\"\n  \n \n  Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.\nJohnson followed.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n \n \n \n   He was something out of a nightmare but his music was straight\nfrom heaven.

You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain.

        "Summary_1": "Johnson, whose full name is John Michael Johnson, is described by Vee Vee as one of Earth\u2019s foremost scientists, and an expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiation in human bodies. He is the protagonist of the story, a human man who has apparently come to Venus in search of another human named Martin. He goes to a bar that has a Room of the Dreamer. Before he enters it, he encounters Vee Vee. She incites both lust and anxiety in Johnson, as he is attracted to her but doesn\u2019t think she should be alone at a Venusian bar. After she attempts to use Karmer\u2019s nerve paralysis on him, he blocks her and threatens her not to do it again. They go into the Room of the Dreamer, where Johnson discovers that Vee Vee knows who he is. The Unger enters and the dreaming begins. Johnson sees a spaceship before him and the room seems to disappear behind him. Johnson is upset when the spaceship disappears and he can\u2019t get it back. He sees Unger starting to levitate and all of Johnson\u2019s various body parts seem to talk to him. When Unger falls, Vee Vee kisses Johnson. He is confused and then realizes that Martin is there and is being attacked. As the passage ends, Johnson and Caldwell are shooting people with their zit guns and trying to get toward Martin as Johnson calls out to Vee Vee. \n",

He has travelled to Venus with a close colleague, Caldwell, to try to find a \u201cfrantic human genius\u201d named Martin at The Dreaming performance. \n\nHe\u2019s intercepted and influenced by a human named Vee Vee during his mission, who appears to have bad intentions towards him that he allows to play out. She may be using him to locate Martin as well, who she had been inquiring about at the club.\n\nJohnson has a drink at the bar and then goes to the dreaming with Vee Vee where she nearly paralyzes him with the Karmer grip that he is fortunately able to break before she gains control of him. During the dreaming performance, Johnson dreams of a ship, but then returns to reality where he catches sight of the Venusian performer, Unger, levitating above the ground in the center of the room. He is astonished at the levitation, and his body is preparing to take action of some means when the room is disrupted by another human - revealed to be Martin. Vee Vee kisses him and rapidly vanishes. The dreaming theatre erupts into violent chaos and the story ends with Johnson and Caldwell shooting their weapons around the room.\n",
        "Summary_3": "John Michael Johnson, Johnny to his friends, is an esteemed scientist from Earth. Presumably, he and his colleague, Caldwell, are developing research or material on Dreamers and what happens when they enter that state of mind. This can be assumed when it is revealed that the man they were searching for on Venus, Martin, knows something about the Dream world that others don\u2019t.\nJohnson makes his way to Venus to chase after Martin and winds up in a dive bar. An attractive young woman attaches herself to his arm after he orders a tarmur, and eventually introduces herself as Vee Vee. Johnson, cautious on this planet due to its unfriendly history with humans, immediately fears for this girl, as he can think of a reason why a human would want her and why a Venusian would want her. \nThey chat and flirt until Caldwell informs Johnson in drunken-code that the girl was inquiring about Martin, the man they were pursuing. Vee Vee expresses interest in visiting the Room of the Dreamer, so Johnson buys tickets for both of them. As they stand to enter the open doors, Vee Vee uses the Karmer nerve block paralysis on him, and it almost works, until Johnson pinches her shoulder and injures her in return. They flirt a little more, then enter the room. As they sit down on their cushioned spot, Vee Vee clings onto him in fear and reveals that his ability to defend himself from the Karmer nerve block proved his identity to her. She knows who he is, Johnny Johnson, and reveals it. \nUnger suddenly appears and promptly goes to sleep. Though they struggle at first with falling asleep, they both do and Johnson sees a spaceship in his dream. Suddenly, he wakes up to Vee Vee grabbing his arm, claiming he woke her up. He hears a strange whirring, which prevents him from falling back into his old dream. He sees Unger begin to float in the air. His body responds, his nerves talking to him, his adrenal gland, his skin. Johnson\u2019s body reacts as his mind does, too. The whole room wakes up thanks to a human\u2019s scream and Unger comes crashing onto the ground. Vee Vee kisses Johnson, as he pulls out his zit gun, a non-lethal weapon. He and Caldwell start shooting at the mass of people attacking the man, who they have discovered is Martin. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Johnson is a well-known scientist from Earth and an expert in electro-magnetic radiations within the human body. He and his associate Caldwell have traveled to Venus to search for a missing scientist named Martin. Their mission is highly secretive; Johnson and Caldwell do not acknowledge each other publicly although they can communicate through finger taps. Johnson is puzzled when a beautiful Earth woman approaches him in a bar and strikes up a conversation. It is odd for her to be there alone because Venus is not safe for unaccompanied women. Johnson suspects Venus authorities might be aware of his mission and might be using the woman to get to him, but he ultimately disregards this thought because he knows that if the Venusians knew his real mission, they would kill him. When Caldwell comes to the bar to order another drink, he finger-taps a message to Johnson to watch out for the woman and tells him that she was asking for Martin earlier. He also says he thinks Martin is or has been there although he hasn\u2019t seen him. Johnson is stunned when the woman uses the Karmer nerve paralysis move on him, and she claims that when he breaks the move, it confirms his identity for her. She knows his full name and that he is a well-known scientist but says she\u2019ll keep his secrets. During the dreaming, Johnson dreams of a spaceship, which is closely associated with his childhood dreams of traveling to the stars. When he awakens from the dream, he senses that something is off. He hears a whirring sound but can\u2019t place what it is, and he is aware his body is producing adrenalin and preparing for action. When everyone is suddenly roused from their dreams, and the Venusians start attacking the human accused of waking them, Caldwell identifies the man as Martin, and Johnson helps him shoot the Venusians with his zit gun to knock them unconscious.\n"

        "Query": "In \"The CONJURER of VENUS,\" what is the role of Vee Vee and what happens to her in the story?",
        "Article": "\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n<doc-sep>Unger stood in the middle of the spot of light.\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his chest muscles contract, then relax. Vee Vee's fingers\nsought his arm, not to harm him but running to him for protection. He\ncaught the flutter of her breathing. On his left, Caldwell stiffened\nand became a rock.\n  \n \n  Johnson had not seen Unger appear. One second the circle of light\nhad been empty, the next second the Venusian, smiling with all the\nimpassivity of a bland Buddha, was in the light. He weighed three\nhundred pounds if he weighed an ounce, he was clad in a long robe\nthat would impede movement. He had appeared in the bright beam of the\nspotlight as if by magic.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers dug deeper into Johnson's arm. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shhh. Nobody knows.\"\n  \n \n  No human knew the answer to that trick. Unless perhaps Martin\u2014\n  \n \n  Unger bowed. A little ripple of something that was not quite sound\npassed through the audience. Unger bowed again. He stretched himself\nflat on the mat, adjusted the rest to support his head, and apparently\nwent to sleep. Johnson saw the Dreamer's eyes close, watched the chest\ntake on the even, regular rhythm of sleep.\n  \n \n  The music changed, a slow dreamy tempo crept into it. Vee Vee's fingers\ndug at Johnson's arm as if they were trying to dig under his hide for\nprotection. She was shivering. He reached for her hand, patted it. She\ndrew closer to him.\n  \n \n  A few minutes earlier, she had been a very certain young woman, able\nto take care of herself, and handle anyone around her. Now she was\nsuddenly uncertain, suddenly scared. In the Room of the Dreaming, she\nhad suddenly become a frightened child looking for protection.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't you ever seen this before?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"N\u2014o.\" She shivered again. \"Oh, Johnny....\"\n  \n \n  Under the circle of light pouring down from the ceiling, the Dreamer\nlay motionless. Johnson found himself with the tendency to hold his\nbreath. He was waiting, waiting, waiting\u2014for what? The whole situation\nwas senseless, silly, but under its apparent lack of coherence, he\nsensed a pattern. Perhaps the path to the far-off stars passed this\nway, through such scented and musical and impossible places as these\nRooms of the Dreamers. Certainly Martin thought so. And Johnson himself\nwas not prepared to disagree.\n  \n \n  Around him, he saw that the Venusians were already going ... going ...\ngoing.... Some of them were already gone. This was an old experience\nto them. They went rapidly. Humans went more slowly.\n  \n \n  The Venusian watchers had relaxed. They looked as if they were asleep,\nperhaps in a hypnotic trance, lulled into this state by the music\nand the perfume, and by something else. It was this something else\nthat sent Johnson's thoughts pounding. The Venusians were like opium\nsmokers. But he was not smoking opium. He was not in a hypnotic trance.\nHe was wide awake and very much alert. He was ...\n  \n \n \n   watching a space ship float in an endless void\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  As Unger had come into the spotlight, so the space ship had come into\nhis vision, out of nowhere, out of nothingness. The room, the Dreamer,\nthe sound of the music, the sweetness of the perfume, Vee Vee and\nCaldwell were gone. They were no longer in his reality. They were not\nin the range of his vision. It was as if they did not exist. Yet he\nknew they did exist, the memory of them, and of other things, was out\non the periphery of his universe, perhaps of\n   \n   the\n   \n  universe.\n  \n \n  All he saw was the space ship.\n  \n \n  It was a wonderful thing, perhaps the most beautiful sight he had seen\nin his life. At the sight of it, a deep glow sprang inside of him.\n  \n \n  Back when he had been a kid he had dreamed of flight to the far-off\nstars. He had made models of space ships. In a way, they had shaped his\ndestiny, had made him what he was. They had brought him where he was\nthis night, to the Dream Room of a Venusian tavern.\n  \n \n  The vision of the space ship floating in the void entranced and\nthrilled him. Something told him that this was real; that here and now\nhe was making contact with a vision that belonged to time.\n  \n \n  He started to his feet. Fingers gripped his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling. You startled me. Don't move.\" Vee Vee's voice. Who\nwas Vee Vee?\n  \n \n  The fingers dug into his arm. Pain came up in him. The space ship\nvanished. He looked with startled eyes at Vee Vee, at the Dream Room,\nat Unger, dreaming on the mat under the spot.\n  \n \n  \"You ... you startled me,\" Vee Vee whispered. She released the grip on\nhis arm.\n  \n \n  \"But, didn't you see it?\"\n  \n \n  \"See what?\"\n  \n \n  \"The space ship!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No.\" She seemed startled and a little terrified and half asleep.\n\"I ... I was watching something else. When you moved I broke contact\nwith my dream.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your dream?\"\n  \n \n  He asked a question but she did not answer it. \"Sit down, darling,\nand look at your damned space ship.\" Her voice was a taut whisper of\nsound in the darkened room. Johnson settled down. A glance to his left\ntold him that Caldwell was still sitting like a chunk of stone.... The\nVenusians were quiet. The music had shifted. A slow languorous beat\nof hidden drums filled the room. There was another sound present, a\nhigh-speed whirring. It was, somehow, a familiar sound, but Johnson had\nnot heard it before in this place.\n  \n \n  He thought about the space ship he had seen.\n  \n \n  The vision would not come.\n  \n \n  He shook his head and tried again.\n  \n \n  Beside him, Vee Vee was silent, her face ecstatic, like the face of a\nwoman in love.\n  \n \n  He tried again for the space ship.\n  \n \n  It would not come.\n  \n \n  Anger came up instead.\n  \n \n  Somehow he had the impression that the whirring sound which kept\nintruding into his consciousness was stopping the vision.\n  \n \n  So far as he could tell, he was the only one present who was not\ndreaming, who was not in a state of trance.\n  \n \n  His gaze went to Unger, the Dreamer....\n  \n \n  Cold flowed over him.\n  \n \n  Unger was slowly rising from the mat.\n  \n \n  The bland face and the body in the robe were slowly floating upward!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  An invisible force seemed to twitch at Johnson's skin, nipping it here\nand there with a multitude of tiny pinches, like invisible fleas biting\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" a voice whispered in his mind. \"This is what you came to\nVenus to see. This ... this....\" The first voice went into silence.\nAnother voice took its place.\n  \n \n  \"This is another damned vision!\" the second voice said. \"This ...\nthis is something that is not real, that is not possible! No Venusian\nDreamer, and no one else, can levitate, can defy the laws of gravity,\ncan float upward toward the ceiling. Your damned eyes are tricking you!\"\n  \n \n  \"We are not tricking you!\" the eyes hotly insisted. \"It is happening.\nWe are seeing it. We are reporting accurately to you. That Venusian\nBuddha is levitating. We, your eyes, do not lie to you!\"\n  \n \n  \"You lied about the space ship!\" the second voice said.\n  \n \n  \"We did not lie about the space ship!\" the eyes insisted. \"When our\nmaster saw that ship we were out of focus, we were not reporting. Some\nother sense, some other organ, may have lied, but we did not.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" Johnson whispered.\n  \n \n  \"I am your skin,\" another voice whispered. \"I am covered with sweat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We are your adrenals. We are pouring forth adrenalin.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your pancreas. I am gearing you for action.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am your thyroid. I....\"\n  \n \n  A multitude of tiny voices seemed to whisper through him. It was as if\nthe parts of his body had suddenly found voices and were reporting to\nhim what they were doing. These were voices out of his training days\nwhen he had learned the names of these functions and how to use them.\n  \n \n  \"Be quiet!\" he said roughly.\n  \n \n  The little voices seemed to blend into a single chorus. \"Action,\nMaster! Do something.\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" Johnson ordered.\n  \n \n  \"But hurry. We are excited.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is a time to be excited and a time to hurry. In this situation,\nif action is taken before the time for it\u2014if that time ever comes\u2014we\ncan all die.\"\n  \n \n  \"Die?\" the chorus quavered.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Johnson said. \"Now be quiet. When the time goes we will all go\ntogether.\"\n  \n \n  The chorus went into muted silence. But just under the threshold the\nlittle voices were a multitude of tiny fretful pressures.\n  \n \n  \"I hear a whirring sound,\" his ears reported.\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  In the front of the room Unger floated ten feet above the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Master, we are not lying!\" his eyes repeated.\n  \n \n  \"I sweat....\" his skin began.\n  \n \n  \"Watch Unger!\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  The Dreamer floated. If wires suspended him, Johnson could not see\nthem. If any known force lifted him, Johnson could not detect that\nforce. All he could say for certain was that Unger floated.\n  \n \n  \"Yaaah!\" The silence of a room was broken by the enraged scream of a\nVenusian being jarred out of his dream.\n  \n \n  \"Damn it!\" A human voice said.\n  \n \n  A wave as sharp as the tip of a sword swept through the room.\n  \n \n  Unger fell.\n  \n \n  He was ten feet high when he started to fall. With a bone-breaking,\nbody-jarring thud, the Dreamer fell. Hard.\n  \n \n  There was a split second of startled silence in the Dreaming Room. The\nsilence went. Voices came.\n  \n \n  \"Who did that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"That human hidden there did it! He broke the Dreaming!\" Anger marked\nthe voices. Although the language was Venusian, Johnson got most of the\nmeaning. His hand dived under his coat for the gun holstered there. At\nhis left, Caldwell was muttering thickly. \"What\u2014what happened? I was\nback in the lab on Earth\u2014\" Caldwell's voice held a plaintive note, as\nif some pleasant dream had been interrupted.\n  \n \n  On Johnson's right, Vee Vee seemed to flow to life. Her arms came up\naround his neck. He was instantly prepared for anything. Her lips came\nhungrily against his lips, pressed very hard, then gently drew away.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014\" he gasped.\n  \n \n  \"I had to do it now, darling,\" she answered. \"There may not be a later.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson had no time to ask her what she meant. Somewhere in the back\nof the room a human screamed. He jerked around. Back there a knot of\nVenusians were attacking a man.\n  \n \n  \"It's Martin!\" Caldwell shouted. \"He\n   \n   is\n   \n  here!\"\n  \n \n  In Johnson's hand as he came to his feet the zit gun throbbed. He fired\nblindly at the mass of Venusians. Caldwell was firing too. The soft\nthrob of the guns was not audible above the uproar from the crowd.\nStruck by the gas-driven corvel charges, Venusians were falling. But\nthere seemed to be an endless number of them.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee?\" Johnson suddenly realized that she had disappeared. She had\nslid out of his sight.\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee!\" Johnson's voice became a shout.\n  \n \n  \"To hell with the woman!\" Caldwell grunted. \"Martin's the important\none.\"\n  \n \n  Zit, zit, zit, Caldwell moved toward the rear, shooting as he went.\nJohnson followed.\n  \n<doc-sep>  The CONJURER of VENUS\n  \n \n  By CONAN T. TROY\n  \n \n \n   A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\n    \n   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\n    \n   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories November 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n  \n \n  \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n  \n \n  \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   are\n   \n  beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n  \n \n  \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n  \n \n  \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n  \n \n  For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee.

What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look!

Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n  \n \n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  A Coffin for Jacob\n  \n \n  By EDWARD W.

The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\ningredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n  \n \n  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\nsmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and\nthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\nMartians or Venusians.\n  \n \n  Someone tugged at his greasy coat.

My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,\n  \n 'Ah, love, let us be true\n To one another! for the world, which seems\n To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n So various, so beautiful, so new,\n Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n Nor certitude\u2014'\"\n  \n  \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how are the notes signed?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd\nimagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but how are they signed?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\"\n  \n \n  \"And so when you first saw me, you thought\u2014\" He began, then stopped\nbecause she was blushing.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been getting them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ever since I can remember.

He could still hear the faint\n   \n   chop-chop\n   \n  of the waves.\n  \n \n  And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape\nglimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to\na sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the\nnewspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read:\n  \n \n  HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE\n  \n \n  Under the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones:\n  \n \n  Foes of Machado Riot in Havana\n  \n \n  Big NRA Parade Planned\n  \n \n  Balbo Speaks in New York\n  \n<doc-sep>For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  \"My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus.

As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage.

        "Summary_1": "Vee Vee is a woman described as very beautiful, with auburn hair, blue eyes and tanned skin. She wears a low-cut green dress and necklace and seems out of place at the dream bar, but unafraid. She introduces herself to Johnson and gets him to escort her to the Room of the Dreamer, even after Caldwell warns him that she has been asking for Martin. She attempts to use Karmer\u2019s nerve paralysis on Johnson and he blocks it. Johnson says she is a child vampire and brings her into the Room of Dreaming; she says next time she\u2019ll use Eve\u2019s trick against him. She says his name and when he questions her, it turns out that she knows exactly who he is and what he does. She claims to have tried the paralysis trick to see if he would block it so she would know if it was him. Self-assured though she was before, she becomes quite frightened in the Room of the Dreamer. After Unger falls and chaos breaks out, she kisses Johnson and says she did it because she might not be able to later. Though he calls for her as he and Caldwell make their way towards Martin, Vee Vee\u2019s whereabouts are unknown at the end of the passage. \n",
        "Summary_2": "VeeVee\u2019s origins are mysterious, but from her appearances in the story we know she is a beautiful human female who is capable of manipulating Johnson. She also possesses some spy-like traits with the ability to assess Caldwell\u2019s drunkard act and recognize that he is informing Johnson, as well as performing the paralyzing Karmer grip on Johnson.\n\nShe seeks out Johnson in the bar and manipulates him into going into The Dreaming alongside her. Because she has prior knowledge of Johnson being Earth's foremost expert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human body, and also shows interest in Martin - the genius Johnson himself is there to find - the reader is left to conclude that VeeVee likely has intentions of gathering expert knowledge about how the dreaming act works. To what end - good or evil - we do not know.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Vee Vee is a human woman, traveling on Venus. She\u2019s wearing a beautiful green dress with a deep neckline and a big necklace. Her blue eyes and brown hair draw Johnson in, along with her cleavage. She is presumably in Venus searching for Martin, the genius that Johnson and Caldwell are also after. She uses the Karmer nerve block on Johnson after flirting with him to determine if he is, in fact, John Michael Johnson, a human scientist. While in the Room of the Dreamer, her demeanor changes, and she suddenly becomes scared. She clings to Johnson as Unger appears and continues latching onto him as they fall asleep. She wakes him up, but she claims he woke her up and then falls back asleep. She is awoken once more when the cry echoes throughout the room. She kisses Johnson, claiming it may be her only chance, then disappears in the night. ",
        "Summary_4": "Vee Vee is a beautiful young woman who somehow knows about Martin, Johnson, and Caldwell. She starts a conversation with Johnson at the bar and identifies Caldwell as his friend. Her unaccompanied presence in the bar is disturbing to Johnson, and Caldwell warns him about her because she has been asking for Martin. It isn\u2019t clear whether she is working for the Venusians, but Johnson suspects she might be. She comes across as strong; she is bold in the way she takes on Johnson, and she uses the Karmer nerve grip on him. After he breaks the hold, she tells him she doesn\u2019t make the same mistake twice; the second time, she breaks the person\u2019s neck. Then she tells him she will get to him Eve\u2019s way. Vee Vee reveals she knows Johnson\u2019s identity but says she\u2019ll keep his secrets and even goes so far as to say no harm will come to him because she is with him. Once they go into the dreaming room, however, Vee Vee begins to act scared. She stays close to Johnson and holds onto him for protection. When the Venusians wake from their dreams, Vee Vee kisses Johnson and then pulls away from him, saying she had to kiss him now because there might not be a later time. Then she disappears as Caldwell identifies Martin, and Johnson and Caldwell begin firing their zit guns as the Venusians. "

Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound.

Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   are\n   \n  beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n  \n \n  \"How did you know?

Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee?

Anyway,\nthere will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've\naccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\n  \n<doc-sep>For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  \"My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus.

As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n  \n \n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n  \n \n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n   \n   en masse\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n  \n \n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\n  \n \n \n   Zinnng-whack!\n   \n \n \n  \"All right!\"\n  \n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n  \n \n  A heat ray!\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n  \n \n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\n  \n<doc-sep>The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Venus Is a Man's World\n  \n \n  BY WILLIAM TENN\n  \n \n  Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n   \n  over the Earth altogether.

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on Venus at an unspecified point in the future. At the very beginning, the setting is outside on a rainy evening. On Venus, the rain falls in all directions, possibly including straight up. Johnson says that everything on Venus feels like it\u2019s coming at him from all directions. He soon enters the club, a perfumed room with loud Venusian music, a bar that Johnson makes his way to, and \u201cfeeling states\u201d that hit Johnson immediately; specifically feelings of love and sex designed to entice humans and Venusians. When they enter the Room of the Dreamer, the perfume becomes stronger and the music louder, playing harmonies that seem new to the ear. The room is massive and only semi-illuminated, with many tiered, carpet and pillow-lined ramps circling up from an empty space with only a mat and headrest. It feels pleasantly cool but also slightly damp, and guests are greeted by a strange, tangible energy. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The entire story takes place on the very rainy planet of Venus, inside a club in an unnamed Venusian city. The club contains a bar and a special room for The Dreaming, which is a group experience of mental trance led on by a Venusian figure that takes place in a theatre-like seating room within the club. The club itself is filled with loud Venusian rhumba music, smoke and perfume. The dreaming room is dark, damp, and cold with perfumed smells and rhythmic lute music.\n\nThere are some references to the dream locations that characters travel to, like Caldwell dreaming of being back in his lab, but the only physical locations of the story are within the club.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Conjurer of Venus takes place on Venus, an extremely rainy planet. At first, the characters are in the main room of a bar. Filled with rhythmic music and feelings of desire, fear, and love, the bar feels crowded and full. Headwaiters attend to everyone\u2019s needs, and booths line the walls. There\u2019s a bar where drinks like tarmur may be poured. \nEventually, they enter the Room of the Dreamer. The music is just as strong here, but there\u2019s another feeling to this room, a certain coldness of unknowingness. The room was perfumed and filled with Venusian lute music. A thick rug lined the ground, as well as plenty of cushions. A man and a headrest lie in the center of the room for Unger\u2019s use. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set on Venus where it rains frequently, heavily, and seemingly from all directions. The planet is occupied by Venusians and some Earthmen, and it offers entertainment designed to appeal to emotions, especially love. The society is quite advanced; it provides entertainment venues that offer liquor, women, and dreams to its patrons. The first part of the story takes place at the bar in one of these entertainment venues; the music there is a Venusian rhumba with a strong beat. The atmosphere is clouded with smoke and perfume. A headwaiter greets people at the door and escorts them to the appropriate part of the establishment based on their desires. When it is time for the dreaming, trumpets play, and a different perfume diffuses into the bar. In the dreaming room, there is a mat and a headrest in the center of the floor, and around it, there are tiers of circular ramps covered with thick rugs and groupings of pillow nests. The dreamer\u2019s perfume is stronger in this room, and the air is cool and somewhat damp. Venusian lute music plays louder; this music sounds inharmonious to Earthmen at first, but once they become used to it, they can follow the rhythms and melodies they never knew existed. When it is time for the dreaming to begin, the lights are turned down very low, and a spotlight shines on the mat in the center of the room. A curtain lifts, and the dreamer, in this case, Unger, enters the spotlight. The music, perfume, and something Johnson can\u2019t identify put the dreamer audience into a sort of trance so that they have their own dreams.\n"

        "Query": "What insights can we gain about the futuristic and complex culture of Venus from \"The CONJURER of VENUS\"?",
        "Article": "Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe.

TROY\n  \n \n \n   A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\n    \n   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\n    \n   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories November 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n  \n \n  \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n  \n \n  \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes? And Venusians were\nhere who would cut her pretty throat for the sake of the necklace that\ncircled it?\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   are\n   \n  beautiful,\" he said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was referring to the bubbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were talking about my eyes,\" she answered, unperturbed.\n  \n \n  \"How did you know? I mean....\"\n  \n \n  \"I am very knowing,\" the girl said, smiling.\n  \n \n  \"Are you sufficiently knowing to be here?\"\n  \n \n  For an instant, as if doubt crossed her mind, the smile flickered. Then\nit came again, stronger. \"Aren't you here?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson choked as bubbles from the tarmur seemed to go suddenly up his\nnose. \"My dear child ...\" he sputtered.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a child,\" she answered with a firm sureness that left no\ndoubt in his mind that she knew what she was saying. \"And my name is\nVee Vee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Vee Vee? Um. That is....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think it's a nice name?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly do. Probably the rest of it is even nicer.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is no more of it. Just Vee Vee.

The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\ningredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n  \n \n  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\nsmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and\nthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\nMartians or Venusians.\n  \n \n  Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it\nwas the dead man's hand.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Coma esta, senor?\n   \n  \" a small voice piped. \"\n   \n   Speken die Deutsch?\nDesirez-vous d'amour? Da?

We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n  \n \n  \"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n  \n \n  \"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\n  \n \n  He flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\n   \n   like rabbits in a snare!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n  \n \n  \"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Six months.

It should be\ninteresting to see an alien race.

A\nrace that was traveling between the stars when we were living in caves?\nDissection is primitive. They won't\n   \n   have to\n   \n  dissect us in order to\nstudy us.

Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\ndeal.\n  \n \n  \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\nstay inside the high-voltage fence.

Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn't\nmake a whit difference\u2014you'd still act sappier than thirty-seven\nangels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. \"Holy\nhollering saints!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded with an airy\nlaugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\nlived to tell it, has he?\"\n  \n \n  \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\ninto his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O'Rielly snorted.\n\"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\n\"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough to\nstuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags,\neven through customs?

What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look! I was\na full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\ntwenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more\u2014just hear more,\nyou hear!

O'Rielly had not\nopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\nhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n  \n \n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The culture on Venus is complex and futuristic, and seems to cater to both Venusians and humans. Women don\u2019t appear to have a particularly high status. A bar like the one the story takes place in is apparently not safe for unaccompanied women, based on Johnson\u2019s initial reaction to her being there alone; he worries that Earth men might abduct her for sex and that Venusians might kill her to steal her jewelry. When Johnson enters, the head waiter asks if he wants liquor, women, or dreams, implying that sex work or some other transactional use of \u201cwomen\u201d is at play there. Through its use of \u201cfeeling states\u201d, the Venusian nightlife appears to have commodified the emotions that people already possess in an attempt to entice, confuse, and manipulate. The popularity of \u201cdreaming\u201d further shows an emphasis on escape and illusion in this culture. The drinks served also seem as much a visual experience as a drinking experience: the bar seems to want to stimulate all senses. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Venusians have a very rich sensory experience in their culture. In the story they are capable of operating at different electromagnetic frequencies than humans - creating trance-like dreams, guided by perfumes and rhythmic music. The humans also experience various feeling states like you would experience smells as they enter the Venusian bar.\n\nVenus is also a place that is dangerous for humans, and although their culture welcomes them to patronize clubs and the dreamings, Venusians are known to harm humans. It\u2019s described that humans die easily where the story takes place and that the motives of human killers are not questioned. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Venus is clearly not very friendly towards humans. According to Johnson, many humans are killed here without so much of an investigation or a worry. Apparently, there were plenty of motives for killing humans, so there was no need to do any sort of investigation. Hence his anxiety when he first met Vee Vee. Her necklace, which he claims Vneusiams would kill her for, and her body, which Earthmen would steal her for, make her a shiny target in Venus. \nBased on the crowdedness of the bar, it seems that Venus has a hedonistic culture. Venusians and humans alike swarm toward the Room of the Dreamer, a way to be able to transport themselves from their present reality to another. \n",
        "Summary_4": "\n\tThe Venusian culture is very centered on feelings and sensations, especially love and the desire for sex. Their entertainment venues are scented with perfumes, and their music has a wild, frantic beat. The different fragrances seem to have different effects. For example, when the dreaming time is near, waves are perfume flow into an area, but the strongest perfume is the one of the dreamer. Their dreaming rooms are designed to provide pleasant feelings with their plush carpets and cozy pillow nests. Venusians in businesses behave in a very patronizing way with humans, referring to them as \u201cmighty humans\u201d and offering them whatever they want. Outside of business dealings, Venusians are less friendly. Single human women are not safe, though, because Venusians are likely to kill a woman to steal a beautiful necklace that she is wearing, and on Venus, no human deaths are investigated, and they happen rather often. There appears to be some antipathy between Venusians and humans; Johnson fears for his life if the Venusians know he is there searching for Martin. And during the dreaming, a Venusian accuses a human of waking him from his dream. The Venusian is enraged, and he and the other Venusians descend on the human and attack him. \n"

I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or\nexplanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in\nthe control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say\nthat for her.

What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers\nnot permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n  \n \n  I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\ncould see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\nvelvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\nexisted in the Universe.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\ndistance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\nIf I just took one quick look....\n  \n \n  But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\nThen I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\nCitizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\ndidn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\nget an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\ncareful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\nmen.\n  \n \n  \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\ncan't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\nPassport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\nclause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\nthis number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\npertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\nyou will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\nNo matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\nthings. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\n   \n   Women\n   \n  like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\nmarried. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\nwouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n  \n \n  Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\nwith me. I knew what Sis could say to\n   \n   that\n   \n  , but at least it was an\nargument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n  \n \n  I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\nthe left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\nmovies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\noff the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\nmust be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\nagainst the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\nMarsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n  \n \n  Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\nblank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\nwall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\nThirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n  \n \n  Another one of those signs.\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Ferdinand is a young man accompanying his sister Evelyn on a spaceliner called the Eleanor Roosevelt with 300 hundred other women. The final destination of the spaceship is Venus, where the women hope to find a husband. Although women are in charge, the crew of the ship is all men. Ferdinand decides to explore the ship, and he encounters a large red sign forbidding passengers from entering the next deck. Despite being hesitant at first, he decides to break the law anyway because he is technically not a passenger on the ship. Ferdinand is amazed to see the stars, the moon, and another spaceliner take off in space. Unfazed by the next sign that tells unauthorized personnel to leave, he goes to the porthole and tries to figure out a way to open it by trying various methods. Suddenly, the door opens, and a large man plucks him inside by the throat. The man recognizes him as a brother to one of the Anura, which he defines as a herd of women looking for mates. Ferdinand explains his childhood in the Undersea and his parents, to which the other man listens intently. He also mentions that he and his sister have left Earth because she realized there would be no future there. All men have either died in wars, become negatively affected by radioactivity, or gone off to the planets. Then, the older man explains that there are little to no women on Venus, and he had no idea that women were in charge when he first went to Earth to find a wife. He had been arrested and was charged but decided to become a stowaway instead. The man, who introduces himself as Alberta (Butt) Lee Brown, gives Ferdinand the nickname Ford and talks more about his past. Eventually, he asks more about Evelyn, and Ferdinand does not overthink his intentions when he answers. Later, Evelyn then forces Ferdinand to go to a geography lecture with her, where she continuously asks questions and takes notes. However, she does not write down his answer after he corrects the purser and instead takes him back to the cabin to lecture him. They begin to debate, and Ferdinand begins to use the words and knowledge he learned from Butt. Evelyn is suspicious that somebody has been feeding him rebellious opinions, and she begins to hound him for answers after seeing he has a photo of her in his pocket. He then takes Evelyn to see Butt, and she begins to lecture him about breaking the law. While the both of them debate over Butt\u2019s status as a criminal and stowaway, he suddenly suggests that they should get married. Evelyn is surprised by his proposal, and Ferdinand eagerly urges her to accept it. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ferdinand Sparling is accompanying his older sister, Evelyn, on a trip to Venus. Society on Earth is ruled by women, and there are barely enough men for each, so many women take a trip to Venus, where men are in surplus, to find a husband. Ferdinand and Evelyn are aboard the Eleanor Roosevelt. Ferdinand decides to explore the ship alone, coming across rooms and areas that passengers are not allowed to go past; he notes that he wasn't really a passenger, because men weren't citizens, and explores them anyway. Ferdinand comes across Lifeboat 47, whose doors are voice activated. He tries to open the doors, and is then pulled inside by a strange, large man with long hair. Ferdinand introduces himself, and quickly learns that the man is a Venusian. Ferdinand tells him about Undersea, where he and Evelyn are from, and his family, including the death of his parents and Evelyn's decision to migrate in search of a husband afterwards. The man tells Ferdinand about growing up on Venus, about how there, it was still a man's world. He had visited Earth to find a wife, but unaware of society there, was quickly in trouble and sentenced to prison. To avoid going broke, he stowed away on the ship. The man introduces himself as Butt, his full name being Alberta Lee Brown, and begins calling Ferdinand \"Ford\". Butt continues telling stories of Venus, such as stories of his brothers, Venusian songs and vocabulary, and Butt's blaster, a weapon that he does not allow Ford to touch. Ferdinand begins visiting Butt regularly, bringing him fresh fruit from the dining hall. Butt starts to gain interest in Evelyn, and Ferdinand answers questions about her for him. One day, Ferdinand and Evelyn are in a geography lecture, where Ferdinand discusses dunging, a concept that has been censored by Earth's libraries. This makes Evelyn suspicious, and she interrogates Ferdinand about where he got the information. Ferdinand digs his hole deeper, using Venusian vocabulary and sharing ideas of male dominance. Evelyn then finds a picture of her in Ferdinand's pocket, and demands to know what man he is speaking to. Ferdinand confesses and tells Evelyn about Butt, and he takes her to visit him. There, she yells at Butt, and threatens legal action, and Butt then makes a surprising proposal; he suggests the two get married.",
        "Summary_3": "Ferdinand is on a spaceship with his elder sister. The ship is jam-packed with females going to Venus in search of husband and he exits the cabin while the women are still in their hammocks. The women at his times have all the rights and do all the important things since the Male Desuffrage Act, so the boy is admitted to the ship on behalf of his sister. He explores the empty ship in search of portholes and after some hesitation enters a forbidden area. There he looks at the stars and then tries to open a lock on the lifeboat. A huge scary man appears with a blaster and frighteningly cold gaze. Ferdinand explains that he comes from Undersea, an area on Earth, and tells his family story - his parents being one of the first married couples in Undersea and dying a while ago, leading to his sister's decision to migrate to Venus. The stranger, Butt, tells about the lack of women on Venus and his travel to Earth in search of a wife without any idea \"it's a woman's world\". So he got in trouble with the law and stowed away on this ship. His many brothers were killed in a rising and only one is left. From that day on Ferdinand keeps visiting the stowaway bringing fruits and listening to stories about Venus. Butt teaches the boy to use the blaster without giving it not hold and constantly asks about Evelyn, the sister. Once, Ferdinand attends a geography lecture on the ship with his sister and corrects the lecturer about Venusian geography. Evelyn starts eliciting where the boy learned that and the boy tells about real men working on Venus. Sis gets angry with those masculine ideas and doesn't believe them to come from a little boy. Ferdinand tries to lie but Sis suppresses him into confession and he leads her to Butt. She tells Butt about all the laws he has broken while the least responds with an appeal to sense. Suddenly, Butt simply proposes a mutually beneficial marriage to stop the debate. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ferdinand Sparling is a passenger aboard that spaceship Eleanor Roosavelt. He lives in a future society in which only women are citizens of Earth, and he is traveling to Venus with his sister Evelyn where she is in search of a husband. Women are seen as intellectuals and the only ones fit to work in positions like the government. As everyone sleeps just after the ship has taken off, Ferdinand decides to explore the ship. He comes to the hull of the ship, the crew are still asleep. In the hull are multiple doors leading to lifeboats. Ferdinand manages to open one of them, and is pulled into the lifeboat by a huge, intimidating looking man. He relates to Ferdinand how he is from Venus and had traveled to Earth to find a wife. Once he got to Earth, he realised that the planet was run by women, and when he didn't realise he has to book into a government run hotel for transient males, assaulted a barman and resisted arrest and was held for contempt in court, he decided to escape back to Venus as a stowaway. When Ferdinand attends a geography lecture with his sister, and reveals the knowledge that he has acquired from spending his days with the Venusian Butt Lee Brown, his sister becomes suspicious. He eventually gets the information that he has been spending time with a stowaway out of him. He takes her to see Butt, where she interrogates him. He tells her how he has enough money for a ticket, but doesn't want to get caught and face charges back on Earth. He tells her how he has admired her from the stories that Ferdinand has told of her, and asks her to marry him. THE END. "

I want you to understand these matters, so that\nyou will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\nNo matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\nthings. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\n   \n   Women\n   \n  like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\nmarried. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\nwouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n  \n \n  Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\nwith me. I knew what Sis could say to\n   \n   that\n   \n  , but at least it was an\nargument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n  \n \n  I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\nthe left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\nmovies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\noff the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\nmust be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\nagainst the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\nMarsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n  \n \n  Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\nblank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\nwall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\nThirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n  \n \n  Another one of those signs.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.\nThen he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n  \n \n  \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added\ncaustically.\n  \n \n  Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.\n\"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And\n   \n   you\n   \n  want to foul up\nVenus.\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of\npolitics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee\nBrown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over\nher. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What\n   \n   do\n   \n  you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She seemed to have gained poise from his loss of it. \"I don't know\nwhy. I'm to find out soon. But actually I'm not lonely. May I tell\nyou a secret?\" She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest\ntrembling. \"Every night the loneliness gathers in around me\u2014you're\nright about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a\nlittle box.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" he said sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures,\nor flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the\npoems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,\n  \n 'Ah, love, let us be true\n To one another! for the world, which seems\n To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n So various, so beautiful, so new,\n Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n Nor certitude\u2014'\"\n  \n  \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how are the notes signed?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd\nimagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but how are they signed?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\"\n  \n \n  \"And so when you first saw me, you thought\u2014\" He began, then stopped\nbecause she was blushing.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been getting them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new\nones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how does this\u2014person get these boxes to you out here? Does he\ngive them to your aunts and do they put them there?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how can they get them in winter?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" he said, pouring himself more lemonade, \"how long is it\nsince you've been to the mainland?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost eighteen years. My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle\nof the war.\"\n  \n \n  \"What war?\" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade.\n  \n \n  \"The World War, of course. What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind\nof terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him\nhad changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders,\nthe same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his\nnostrils. He could still hear the faint\n   \n   chop-chop\n   \n  of the waves.\n  \n \n  And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape\nglimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to\na sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the\nnewspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read:\n  \n \n  HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE\n  \n \n  Under the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones:\n  \n \n  Foes of Machado Riot in Havana\n  \n \n  Big NRA Parade Planned\n  \n \n  Balbo Speaks in New York\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Evelyn Sparling is the older sister of Ferdinand Sparling. She is seven years older than him and was born in the Undersea. Her parents were one of the first people to get married in the Undersea, and her mom was an Undersea representative in the World Council. Furthermore, her mom was heavily involved in the Male Desuffrage Act and the Maternal Revolution before being blown up in a surfacing boat alongside her husband. Evelyn herself is proficient in operating sub-surface machinery, believes firmly in the ideals of women leading politics, and is also very focused on affairs that other women do not care much about. She is also skilled at detecting lies, seeing past Ferdinand\u2019s lies that he spoke of to protect Butt\u2019s identity. Moreover, she has a very assertive personality. She did not back down from correcting Ferdinand about the opinions he picked up from Butt, which she classifies as masculinist and anti-socialist. Even if Butt is an intimidating man, her righteousness still shines through when she begins to scold him for escaping Earth on the Eleanor Roosevelt and about how he is also implicating Ferdinand in breaking the law by having the younger boy deliver fruit to him. Despite Evelyn\u2019s forceful nature, she does care for her younger brother and tells him what women appreciate in men. ",
        "Summary_2": "Evelyn Sparling is the older sister of Ferdinand by seven years. She watches over Ferdinand and takes on almost a maternal role, scolding him and directing him throughout the story. Evelyn is strong-minded and intelligent, well-versed in politics. She represents the typical woman in the societal structure of Earth, and advises her brother to be the ideal man. Evelyn is extremely cautious and abides by the rules; when she finds out that Ferdinand has been talking to Butt, she panics and tries to put an end to it as soon as possible.",
        "Summary_3": "Evelyn Sparling is Ferdinand's sister. She is migrating to Venus as many other women in search of a husband. She is bossy, lecturing and the head of the family of two - her and her brother. She is described as healthy, she is a careful student who listens and takes notes of every word. She is very serious and concentrated. She follows the law and enjoys politics, she wants to lead. She is a feminist, as most women on Earth, and she is very insistent. ",
        "Summary_4": "Evelyn Sparling is the sister of Ferdinand Sparling. She is on the way to Venus, aboard the spaceship \"Eleanor Roosavelt '', in search of a husband. She is an intellectual woman, constantly reading. She hopes to work in a government position some day, after she has found a husband. She realises that there are only three men to every four women on Earth, so she must look elsewhere. She teaches Ferdinand to be intellectually driven, and well spoken, as women will admire those characteristics when he enters the marriage market. She is the only girl in the geography lecture who takes notes, making sure to keep her mind in shape. To Butt, Ferdinand describes Evelyn as a \"healthy girl\". When she realises what Feridinand was up to, she promises not to turn Butt in, showing her kind side. She interrogates Butt, interrogating him and scorning him for breaking the law. She does seem to let him off in the end though after he has explained his case. She is a very learned, intelligent and fair person. "

I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to\nwipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n  \n \n  \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n  \n \n  A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers\nwanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n  \n \n  \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of\nthem that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has\nbeen giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it?

I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided\nmiserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n  \n \n  All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could\nhelp it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to\nhim. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a\nlittle better.\n  \n \n  The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was\nwith me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his\nfingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n  \n \n  He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered\nhis blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump\nwhen she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n  \n \n  \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come\nright in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n  \n \n  So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the\ndoor. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or\nexplanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in\nthe control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say\nthat for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed\nsternly.\n  \n \n  \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in\nclass, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political\ncrime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away\nwithout paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores\nintended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man.

He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n  \n<doc-sep>For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.\n\"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?\nAnd I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n  \n \n  He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\n\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what\nbusiness do\n   \n   you\n   \n  have this close to the hull?\"\n  \n \n  After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also\nbecome a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n  \n \n  He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found\nmyself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis\ninsists such things have always had for men.\n  \n \n  \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll\ncall you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n  \n \n  I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a\nblaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the\neighties\u2014the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named\nall us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the\nname they were saving for a girl.\"\n  \n \n  \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they\nwere all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys\u2014all\nexcept me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down.\nTook a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down\nthe Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n  \n \n  I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of\nthe blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with\nthat, Mr. Butt?\"\n  \n \n  \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at\nthe light globe. \"No more'n twelve\u2014not counting five government\npaddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter.

        "Summary_1": "Alberta Lee Brown, nicknamed Butt, is the man from Venus who Ferdinand meets when he explores the spaceliner. Butt used to have a very large family, and his father immigrated in the eighties after being evacuated from Ontario. His family also consisted of many brothers, also named after Canadian provinces, Unfortunately, all of his brothers except Saskatchewan and him were murdered  by the MacGregor boys in an incident known as the Blue Chicago Rising. He is not one to usually act brutally, but he has not hesitated to pull the trigger on people who have wronged him. Butt has great knowledge of his blaster and is capable of explaining everything about it to Ferdinant. Additionally, he tells Ferdinand that he has killed twelve people, excluding the five government personnel, and that he considers his brother as someone who is much more willing to resort to violence. Although he is usually level-headed, Butt is also a very blunt person. He is not afraid to tell Ferdinand what he thinks of Earth, and his actions of breaking the law as a criminal on the run show that he is more than willing to take dangerous risks if he disagrees with something. Butt also tends to act rashly, suggesting to Evelyn that they get married during their first meeting despite never having interacted with her before and only having an impression of her based on what Ferdinand told him earlier. ",
        "Summary_2": "Alberta Lee Brown, nicknamed Butt, is a native Venusian man who is currently stowed away aboard the ship. Initially unaware of the women-ruled society on Earth, he had visited in search of a wife, gotten into trouble, and snuck onto the ship to avoid bankruptcy and legal punishment. Butt is a skilled man in combat, though he believes that violence is usually not the answer. He has long hair, something never seen on an Earthman and catching Ferdinand by surprise. Butt tells Ferdinand stories of Venus and their people, and in return he takes an interest in Evelyn, asking questions about her.",
        "Summary_3": "Alberta Lee Brown or Butt is a huge man from Venus. He was born in a huge family with lots of brothers who were all but one killed in a rising. He was living on some lonely little islands on Venus and searching for a wife. He came to Earth for that purpose and soon got in trouble as he didn't know it was a women's world. He was used to men being the main figures and soon was brought to court, eventually he escaped and hid on this spaceship going back to Venus. He has a dark tan, huge body and long hair. He turns out to be an interesting storyteller and starts caring about the boy. He is also interested in the boy's sister as she fits an image of a good wife - strong, healthy and knowledgeable. He is straightforward and appeals to sense rather than law. ",
        "Summary_4": "Alberta Lee Brown is the stowaway aboard the \"Eleanor Roosavelt\". He was born on Venus and travelled to Earth in search of a wife. He had no idea that Earth was run by women, and only realised this when he got there. He gets in trouble immediately, not following protocol for travelling to Earth as a man from another planet, assaulting a bartender, resisting arrest and \"sassing\" a judge in court. He was enraged that he had female attorneys, as on Mars, men speak for themselves, and women only walk by their side. He was sentenced to jail.He has many brothers, and he has killed many men, but doesn't consider himself \"violent\". He is very gruff and blunt. He clearly hates the idea of women having power. He asks about Ferdinand's sister, and gets annoyed at the idea of her marrying someone else. When Evelyn finds him in the lifeboat, he uses his astute skills to convince her that he hadn't really done anything wrong. He then takes on a straightforward demeanour, immediately asking her to marry him. "

        "Query": "In the story \"Venus Is a Man's World\", how does the power dynamic between genders differ on Earth and Venus?",
        "Article": " \n  Venus Is a Man's World\n  \n \n  BY WILLIAM TENN\n  \n \n  Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n   \n  over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!\n  \n \n \n  I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a\ngirl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\njam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\nhusbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet\nVenus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n  \n \n  Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n  \n \n  \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\n   \n   Family Problems of the Frontier Woman\n   \n  . \"Remember you're\na nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n  \n \n  I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\nfront of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\nhammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\ncrews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\nto run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\nreally see the\n   \n   Eleanor Roosevelt\n   \n  !\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\nnotions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in an\natom's eyebrow. Touchy as hornets on a hot griddle, them Venus guys.\nCrazier than bed bugs about war. Could smell a loose dollar a million\nlight years away too. Finagled around until they finally cooked up a\ndeal.\n  \n \n  \"No Venus dames allowed within fifty miles of their port. Earth guys\nstay inside the high-voltage fence. Any dame caught trying to leave\nVenus thrown to the tigers for supper. Same for any Earth guy caught\naround a Venus dame. In return, Earth could buy practically everything\nat bargain basement prices.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I was shown the history films in pre-flight,\" O'Rielly said, still\ndreamily. \"But not a peek of any Venus dame.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pray heaven you'll never lay eyes on one nor have one get within ten\nfoot of you! Even though you'd know she'd be your damnation wouldn't\nmake a whit difference\u2014you'd still act sappier than thirty-seven\nangels flying on vino.\" Callahan suddenly stared at O'Rielly. \"Holy\nhollering saints!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, now, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded with an airy\nlaugh. \"No Earth guy for a hundred twenty-five years been near one and\nlived to tell it, has he?\"\n  \n \n  \"So the whispers run,\" Callahan murmured with a queer flame dancing\ninto his eyes. \"So the old whispers still run.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never a name, though. Never how it was done.\" O'Rielly snorted.\n\"Probably just a goofy tale set loose by some old space bum.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh?\" Callahan bristled up like a bad name had been bandied about.\n\"Seen them ditty bags Venus bigwigs have, ain't you? Some big enough to\nstuff a cow in. Notice how nobody ever dares question a bigwig's bags,\neven through customs? Just run 'em through the big Geiger that tells\nwhether there's any fusionable junk inside. Well, our boy got himself\none of them bags, stuffed himself inside and joined a bigwig's pile of\n'em.\n  \n \n  \"Didn't pull it whilst on the Venus port during a layover either, when\na crew check would of turned him up missing. Pulled it on vacation.\nStarted on the Earth end. Made himself a pair of beards to paste on his\nears of course. Wove Jupiter wiggle worms in to keep the beards moving.\nWasn't like the real thing, but good enough to flimflam Venus guys.\"\n  \n \n  With suddenly enlivened interest O'Rielly looked at Callahan. \"Hey, how\ncome you know so much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself\u2014or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look! I was\na full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\ntwenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more\u2014just hear more,\nyou hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could\nput your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't high\non vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we\nfeed the Old Woman?\"\n  \n \n  \"Search me,\" Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully.\n  \n \n  \"Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for!\nAwp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at\nleast!\"\n  \n \n  Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee.\nOld Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway\nwas saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\nlovely neck and his own forever.\n  \n \n  O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not\nopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\nhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n  \n \n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers\nnot permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n  \n \n  I peeked around the corner. I knew it\u2014the next deck was the hull. I\ncould see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the\nvelvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed\nexisted in the Universe.\n  \n \n  There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this\ndistance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely.\nIf I just took one quick look....\n  \n \n  But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.\nThen I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth\nCitizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And\ndidn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to\nget an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the\ncareful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to\nmen.\n  \n \n  \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You\ncan't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth\nPassport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this\nclause\u2014'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,\nthis number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations\npertaining'\u2014and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that\nyou will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.\nNo matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb\nthings. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what\n   \n   Women\n   \n  like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting\nmarried. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her\nwouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n  \n \n  Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do\nwith me. I knew what Sis could say to\n   \n   that\n   \n  , but at least it was an\nargument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n  \n \n  I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to\nthe left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the\nmovies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding\noff the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it\nmust be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose\nagainst the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,\nMarsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n  \n \n  Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of\nblank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the\nwall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers:\nThirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n  \n \n  Another one of those signs.\n  \n<doc-sep>She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rebellion?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n  \n \n  They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered.

It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dimdooly\u2014the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere\nEarthmen kowtowing to a mere woman\u2014swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,\nthen all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had\nenough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\nlove only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\nworks. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we\nVenus women had our own men in our power.\"\n  \n \n  \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof\nenough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth's\ntranquility.\"\n  \n \n  Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.\nWorse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked\naway from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away\nfrom Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest\nheadache in history.\n  \n \n  \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree\nperfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been\nconducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame\nPresident of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\n  \n \n  \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to\nreceive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest\nconvenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological\nmoment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the\ncommunications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels\nbroadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the\ntop man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take\nover Dimmy's credentials.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said\ngraciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\n  \n \n  \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that\nMr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our\nrevolution better than they knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No\ndoubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs\nbest.\"\n  \n \n  The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged\nDimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan.\nEspecially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his\nold conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure\nbefore returning to your stations.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, well,\" O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond\nearshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\n  \n \n  \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of\nSaturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\ncrows for breakfast.\" Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\ngrin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O'Rielly\nsaid in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\ndid Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\nlike to himself, \"they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,\nguess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.\nDames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be one\nmuch longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves\nbut didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing\nto take over Venus, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium\nbefore her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leave\nGrandmamma?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, ma'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Rielly\nsaid, \"you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'n\nBilly-be-damned. And that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure,\" O'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, 'that's all.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?\nCourse not.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ain't nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma'am.\nVenus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tickles 'em, boy, tickles 'em!\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.\nThen he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n  \n \n  \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added\ncaustically.\n  \n \n  Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.\n\"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And\n   \n   you\n   \n  want to foul up\nVenus.\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of\npolitics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee\nBrown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over\nher. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What\n   \n   do\n   \n  you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Women are generally given positions of power and have significant influence over political matters on Earth. Most of the hard labor is left to the men instead of the women. Ferdinand mentions that the crews on the spaceliner ships are always men, as women fulfill the more important tasks of running governments. It is also revealed that only women can become Earth Citizens because of the Male Desuffrage Act, which means that men cannot get an interplanetary passport. In many situations, women have the final say as well. When Butt was arrested on Earth, he could only use a female attorney to communicate his thoughts. Compared to the women, the men on Earth face much more restrictions and must follow what they say at all times. The number of men on Earth has greatly diminished, and the population primarily consists of women. \n\nOn the other hand, Venus is primarily male-inhabited, and there is a scarcity of women there. Butt says that he is unused to the saying \"it's a woman's world\" because women do not run Venus, unlike Earth. He also told his attorney that on Venus, a man could speak freely if he wanted to, and a woman's role is to support him. Men can also make a law whenever they wish with their own guns and that they should not wholly be subservient to the rule of women. ",
        "Summary_2": "Earth is a planet where women dominate. There are a surplus of women on Earth, way more than men, and men are not citizens on Earth as a result of the Male Desuffrage Act. Women rule the government and its decisions on Earth. Venus is quite the opposite, where men still remain prominent and in control while women are scarce. Venus is much more primitive than Earth, with the men being skilled in battle. Because of the complementary differences between Earth and Venus, many Earthwomen travel to Venus in search of a husband. ",
        "Summary_3": "After previous political structure had failed, Earth became ruled by women. Women are citizens and have all the rights, they are in every important sphere and they are the majority. They are the leaders and there is even an Act diminishing men and their rights. Men can only move as women's plus ones and are simply needed for reproduction. On Venus, on the opposite, there are more men and they seek for women. Women are searching for mild and steady men to support females in their careers. Men on Venus are in charge, they are building Venus with masculine jobs to start a civilization there, as the conditions on the planet are difficult and require real men. ",
        "Summary_4": "The society on Earth is run by women. The \"Male Suffrage Act\" was put in place after the third atomic war. Men were seen to not be fit to work in positions such as the government anymore. Only women are eligible to be citizens. There aren't as many men anymore on Earth as most of them have died due to various wars. All intellectual and important roles are filled by women. There are also a number of cities which lie under water on Earth, they are mining communities. A lot of women leave Earth in search of a husband, as there are so few left on Earth. \nMars seems to be the opposite to this. Men still hold the power and women, stand by their side, still silent. Venus is also a newer civilisation, and it seems as if it's citizens are freer to partake in violent, criminal acts which would be punished on Earth. "

        "Article": " \n  Venus Is a Man's World\n  \n \n  BY WILLIAM TENN\n  \n \n  Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n   \n  over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!\n  \n \n \n  I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a\ngirl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\njam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\nhusbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet\nVenus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n  \n \n  Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n  \n \n  \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\n   \n   Family Problems of the Frontier Woman\n   \n  . \"Remember you're\na nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n  \n \n  I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\nfront of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\nhammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\ncrews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\nto run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\nreally see the\n   \n   Eleanor Roosevelt\n   \n  !\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\n   \n   future\n   \n  ! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n  \n \n  And\n   \n   he\n   \n  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n  \n \n  \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n  \n \n \n   If\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rebellion?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n  \n \n  They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n  \n \n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Oui.\n   \n  \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\nkeep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\n   \n   n'est-ce-pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are spacemen?\"\n  \n \n  Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\n   \n   Ich danke, senor.\n   \n  You\nknow why city is called Hoover City?\"\n  \n \n  Ben didn't answer.\n  \n \n  \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\nthousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ai-yee\n   \n  , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n  \n \n  He needed help.\n  \n \n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n  \n \n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\n   \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story is mainly set on the Eleanor Roosevelt spaceliner. The ship is a luxury liner, and there are purple lights in front of the doors that light up when a girl is inside on her hammock. Ferdinand describes the ship as being very large, consisting of smooth black walls and white doors that seem to go on endlessly. There are multiple numbered decks and steam jets. The engines and machinery are all properly oiled. Multiple portholes line the hulls, and there is the feeling of gravity underfoot. Many emergency-use spacesuits in glass cases also line the crossways. Some of the decks also have signs with glowing red letters that warn passengers not to enter further. The portholes are described to have no knobs, switches, or even a button to press to open them. Inside the portholes, there are also bunks for the lifeboats. Some of the other amenities on the ship include a dining salon, library, and numbered lifeboat sections for passengers to go to if there is an emergency. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place aboard the Eleanor Roosevelt, a spaceship leaving from Earth to Venus. The spaceship is large, and Ferdinand explores it throughout the story. The ship contains many decks, including a hull with portholes, where the view of space and stars is visible. From the portholes, Ferdinand can see the Moon and another spaceship headed towards Mars. Ferdinand then finds Lifeboat 47, where he meets Butt, who had been staying there. The ship also contains a dining room, a lecture hall, and a salon.",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins on a huge spaceship packed with over three hundred females traveling to Venus. All of them have their cabins with hammocks along the corridor. Pictures of stars are everywhere in the corridor but no actual portholes. There is an outside level under the hull though and it has portholes, but the  area is prohibited to enter for the passengers. From there opens a great view at the stars and the Moon. There was also a lifeboat. The rest of the story takes place either in the cabin with Sis or in the lifeboat with Butt. Once, the setting moves to a class with a geography lecture. ",
        "Summary_4": "The main setting of the story takes place on the \"Eleanor Roosavelt''. It is a starship headed for the planet Venus. It holds three hundred women, all of whom seem to share cabins. Everyone has their own acceleration hammock. There are lights on the cabin doors, which glow purple when the occupants are sleeping. The corridor that holds all the doors to the cabins curves out of sight, with its black walls and white doors. The ship seems to be huge. There are pictures of stars on the walls. There is a crossway, which leads to various decks , the main engine, the main jets and the gravity helix and the hull. We also know that there is a dining salon and a library. Along the walls are spacesuits cased in glass, in case of emergency. There is a huge notice sign passed deck twelve telling passengers to not go any further. Past this sign is the hull. Every twelve feet is a porthole. Farther down the corridor is the entrance to lifeboat 47, with a voice activated lock. "

Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ration it to the men!\"\n  \n \n  \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in\nthe middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n  \n \n  \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block\nout sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service\nhasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n  \n \n  \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't\nlike to think how they would taste.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink\nalmond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that\nwine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up\nsensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are\ngoing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of\nwine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,\nand then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.\nI'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She nodded. \"There are quite a few of us now\u2014about a thousand\u2014and a\ndozen ships. Our base used to be here on Venus, down toward the Pole.\nThe dome we're in now was designed and built by us a few years ago\nafter we got pushed off Mars. We lost a few men in the construction,\nbut with almost every advance in space, someone dies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Venus is getting too civilized. We're moving out and this dome is only\na temporary base when we have cases like yours. The new base\u2014I might\nas well tell you it's going to be an asteroid. I won't say which one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't get the idea that we're outlaws. Sure, about half our group is\nwanted by the Bureau, but we make honest livings. We're just people\nlike yourself and Jacob.\"\n  \n \n  \"Jacob? Your husband?\"\n  \n \n  She laughed. \"Makes you think of a Biblical character, doesn't it?\nJacob's anything but that. And just plain 'Jake' reminds one of a\ngrizzled old uranium prospector and he isn't like that, either.\"\n  \n \n  She lit a cigarette. \"Anyway, the wanted ones stay out beyond the\nfrontiers. Jacob and those like him can never return to Earth\u2014not even\nto Hoover City\u2014except dead. The others are physical or psycho rejects\nwho couldn't get clearance if they went back to Earth. They know\nnothing but rocketing and won't give up. They bring in our ships to\nfrontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't the authorities object?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not very strongly. The I. B. I. has too many problems right here to\nsearch the whole System for a few two-bit crooks. Besides, we carry\ncargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff that's\nscarce on Earth and Mars and Venus. Nobody really cares whether it\ncomes from the asteroids or Hades. If we want to risk our lives mining\nit, that's our business.\"\n  \n \n  She pursed her lips. \"But if they guessed how strong we are or that we\nhave friends planted in the I. B. I.\u2014well, things might be different.\nThere probably would be a crackdown.\"\n  \n \n  Ben scowled. \"What happens if there\n   \n   is\n   \n  a crackdown? And what will you\ndo when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids? They can't\nignore you then.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we move on. We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them\nto Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. In time, maybe, we'll be\npushed out of the System itself. Maybe it won't be the white-suited\nboys who'll make that first hop to the stars. It\n   \n   could\n   \n  be us, you\nknow\u2014if we live long enough. But that Asteroid Belt is murder. You\ncan't follow the text-book rules of astrogation out there. You make up\nyour own.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\n   \n   future\n   \n  ! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n  \n \n  And\n   \n   he\n   \n  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n  \n \n  \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n  \n \n \n   If\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n  \n \n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Oui.\n   \n  \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\nkeep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\n   \n   n'est-ce-pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are spacemen?\"\n  \n \n  Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\n   \n   Ich danke, senor.\n   \n  You\nknow why city is called Hoover City?\"\n  \n \n  Ben didn't answer.\n  \n \n  \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\nthousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ai-yee\n   \n  , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n  \n \n  He needed help.\n  \n \n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n  \n \n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot!

She realizes that her nation has lost after 9 years of war and remembers about her task to explode both ships. When she resolves to press the button, it doesn\u2019t work. By deception, she manages to defeat the guards on the ship. Then she gets to the inquisitor and by control of his mind makes him set her free and send her to another zone as a clerk. There a supervisor gets suspicious of her transfer but she convinces him in her honesty. After that she meets Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns, her main aim, and is forced to shoot her own father not to be uncovered. From that moment she becomes a private dancer for Perat by night, and a spy into the officers\u2019 minds by day. One day Perat showed Evelyn a reel of his father, a boy, and a woman very much alike her. This reel was sent by his father with a greeting from Perat\u2019s wife and son, though he was not married. Then the mysterious topic changes and Perat asks Evelyn to accompany him to the execution of the foolish inquisitor. Scared of being recognised by the inquisitor she used a dangerous perfume capable of causing death and entered the room. ",

She realizes that when she wakes up that it is time to set off the device given to her that is meant to destroy both of the globes. She goes to the device to do so only to realize that it was in shattered ruins. Dismayed but still understanding that she has a job to complete, she sets a strict and tight timeline for herself to fix the device. To fix the device, she sets about to collect components that she needs. She leaves her cubicle and carries little with her to ensure that she appears harmless. \n\nAfter she leaves her cubicle, she senses a man with a desire to kill her. Using her telepathic capabilities, she overpowers the man and strips him of his uniform and weapon. She then kills him. She then goes to get a travel visa from a man and does so by controlling his mind to get the necessary information and documents that she wants. When she makes it to the Occupational Commandant of Zone One she goes to the personal office. She flirts with the a man to explain her transfer to the headquarters. At the end of the meeting, she is directed to meet with Perat on his balcony. On her way there she feels someone reading her brain and thinks about false information to feed them what she wants them to believe about her. She gets to the balcony where Perat is standing with a gun. Below the balcony, she chills when she notices her father is the prisoner meant to be executed. She shoots her father with the justification that it was necessary to complete her mission. \n\nLater on Evelyn dances for Perat and repeats this routine, among other tasks, for a period of time. Eventually, Perat pesters and accuses her of being someone other than she says she is. He shows her a video of a woman that looks strikingly similar to her. She denies being the woman.

        "Summary_3": "Evelyn Kane awakes injured and in pain to the sound of a voice, commanding her to die. She is the daughter of Gordon Kane, the commander of The Defender, a Terran battle globe. The Defender has been in a nine year war with The Invader, its Scythian counterpart, and Evelyn had previously promised her father that she would die on the planet instead of escaping, doing so by pressing a button that would detonate the globe and both empires. As she awakes, she realizes that the time has come to press the button. However, the cell in which she stays in had been damaged by an explosion, the button being beyond repair. Determined to obtain a replacement or repair the button, but unable to do so herself, she decides to set out, using her telepathic abilities to go undercover as a Scythian guard by killing one and wearing his uniform. She then visits the Inquisitor, who questions why she is wearing a Scythian uniform and plans to take her prisoner. Evelyn uses her telepathy on the Inquisitor to make him fill out a visa for her to visit the Occupational Commandant, Perat. Once there, she visits an office, where she is questioned and sent to Perat, who wishes to see her. Evelyn realizes that Perat is even more skilled than her in the realm of telepathy, so she is not able to use her abilities on him and instead must conceal that she possesses them at all. Evelyn's first order from Perat is to execute a final prisoner in the courtyard, who ends up being her father. Reluctantly, she does so to follow orders. For the next month or so, Evelyn dances for Perat every night, using the daytime to gather any information possible to help her construct a new device. One night, Perat shows Evelyn an image of an old man, a boy, and a woman. Perat identifies the man as his father, but the woman looks identical to Evelyn. Perat's father had sent this to him, naming Evelyn as his widow; both Perat and Evelyn have no explanation. Perat then informs Evelyn that he must attend a courtmartial, where he must address a man who let a woman prisoner escape. Evelyn realizes that this man is the Inquisitor, and she must join Perat at the hearing while going unrecognized.",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts with Evelyn, a Terran at The Defender, waking up in a cubicle, badly hurt. Soon, we learn that the Terrans are in war with The Invader. There was a huge explosion, and if Evelyn gets the chance to survive, she was told to carry the secret of the Terrans. When she comes out from her cubicle, with a few broken ribs, she heard the sound of a low-born Scythe four hundred yards behind her. There, she uses her telepathic skills and avoided being caught or murdered. Instead, the Scythe drops unconscious on the ground. Then at the inquisitor, she was questioned. After having the inquisitor ask the guards to leave, she uses her telepathic skills on him. She is then set free with a visa for woman clerk, and the guards and the inquisitor does not remember a thing about her. Then finally, she gets to meet the Viscount. But then she is shocked to see her father being captured and announced as the last Terran alive in The Defender. She is further horrified by the fact that she has to kill him. Because she knows that there is no other possible way, she indeed shot her father. \n\nLater, we learn that Perat has an image of a woman that has the identical scars as the one on Evelyn\u2019s head, this finding might affect Evelyn\u2019s destruction plan. Later, Perat asks Evelyn to be the clerk for tonight\u2019s coutmartial where some inquisitor did not show proper disposition of a female prisoner.

        "Query": "What was the nature of the relationship between Evelyn and her father in Stalemate In Space?",
        "Article": "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK STALEMATE IN SPACE ***\n  \n  Stalemate In Space\n  \n \n  By CHARLES L.

The top of the\ncubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a\nrib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of\nknowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.\nFor a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Die now\u2014die now\u2014die now\n   \n  \u2014\"\n  \n \n  The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and\nit was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great\nbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this\ntiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain\nher countrymen had either definitely won\u2014or lost.\n  \n \n  The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had\nexpected nothing else.\n  \n \n  She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would\nset in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,\nand the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless\ngrave of space.\n  \n \n  But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon\nimmediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily\nover the memories of her past.\n  \n \n  For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized\nbattle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian\nglobe,\n   \n   The Invader\n   \n  , sprang out of black space to enslave the budding\nTerran Confederacy,\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  was unfinished, half-equipped, and\nundermanned.\n  \n \n  The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.\n  \n \n \n   The Defender\n   \n  , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled\nitself from its orbit around Procyon and met\n   \n   The Invader\n   \n  with giant\nfission torpedoes.\n  \n \n  And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic\nCloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men\npoured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken\n   \n   Defender\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal\nand terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the\nScythians nine years to conquer\n   \n   The Defender's\n   \n  outer shell. Then had\ncome that final interview with her father.\n  \n \n  \"In half an hour our last space port will be captured,\" he had\ntelepathed curtly. \"Only one more messenger ship can leave\n   \n   The\nDefender\n   \n  . Be on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I shall die here.\"\n  \n \n  His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. \"Then\ndie usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will\ndestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are\nsuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the\nbattle.\"\n  \n \n  \"There's an off-chance you may survive,\" countered a mentor. \"We're\nalso working on a means for your escape\u2014not only because you are\nGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent\nradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with\nour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you must expect to die,\" her father had warned with gentle\nfinality.\n  \n \n  She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched\nherself back to the present.\n  \n \n  That time had come.\n  \n \n  With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on\nthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with\nboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo\nfissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the\nship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing\nwould she die.\n  \n \n  She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in\ndismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds\nand was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubicle\nhad been terrific.\n  \n \n  With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examined\nthe interior of the box.\n  \n \n  It was a shattered ruin.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathing\nhard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best,\nfinding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during the\ninterval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk that\nclutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.\n  \n \n  She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.\n  \n \n  Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were still\nintact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself,\nset the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were\nunsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian\nenemies.\n  \n \n  Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly.\nThe cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on the\nchaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform.\nThen she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun the\nsealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling on\nthe side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly\nto her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve\nof her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring\nthe surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she\nwas alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the\ncubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling\nfrom her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle\nto come would be her apparent harmlessness.\n  \n \n  Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born\nScythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that\nof a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black\nstumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had\nsupplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.\n  \n \n  The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and\nevidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:\nShould he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two\nmonths since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot.\nYes, he would shoot.\n  \n \n  Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously,\nhoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With\nsatisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind\nof the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up\nbehind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first.\nHe had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards,\nhe would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on.\nWomen auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.\n  \n \n  Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved\nfaster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in\nthe mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He\nwas not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidly\nonward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches,\nthinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yards\nin this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and\nthe dull light in his brain went out.\n  \n \n \n \n   She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.\n   \n \n \n \n  Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from\nbehind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man.\nFor I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite\neffective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped\nthe odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam\npower down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While\nhe bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the\nbeam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at\nleast, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of\na woman.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.\n  \n \n  \"Name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Evelyn Kane.\"\n  \n \n  The eyes of the inquisitor widened. \"So you admit to a Terran name.\nWell, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply\nlorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry\ncorporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally,\nwhere is the corporal? Did you kill him?\"\n  \n \n  He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have\nthe guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a\nway, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran\nclass. No\u2014he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford\nanother woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with\nthis cool murderess.\n  \n \n  \"Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the\ncorporal?\" He leaned impatiently over his desk.\n  \n \n  The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The\nguards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was\ntheir custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.\n  \n \n  She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the\ninquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.\n  \n \n  \"If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the\nguards out for a few minutes,\" she said, placing a hand on her hip. \"I\nhave interesting information.\"\n  \n \n  So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he\ncould take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the\nguards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one\nanother.\n  \n \n  Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib\ngingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He\nwould certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut\nshort with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mind\ngreater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the\nrecorder.\n  \n \n  \"Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,\" she asked\ntersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.\n  \n \n  \"Perat, Viscount of Tharn,\" replied the man mechanically.\n  \n \n  \"What is the extent of his jurisdiction?\"\n  \n \n  \"From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles\nradius.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for\npassage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.\"\n  \n \n  The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a\nseal at its bottom.\n  \n \n  \"You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:\n'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'\"\n  \n \n  The man's pen scratched away obediently.\n  \n \n  Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor.\nShe took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.\n\"Call the guards,\" she ordered.\n  \n \n  He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.\n  \n \n  \"This person is no longer a prisoner,\" said the inquisitor woodenly.\n\"She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant of\nZone One.\"\n  \n \n  When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had any\nmemory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, the\nrecording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,\nand sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for\nauditing.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Andre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.\n  \n \n  I knew I could not let Doc's\u2014Dad's\u2014time travel\n   \n   thing\n   \n  fall into\nanyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had\ndisappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.\n  \n \n  Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I\ndon't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.\n  \n \n  I kicked the\n   \n   thing\n   \n  to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you\ncan't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums\nbefore Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time\ntravel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we\nweren't now.\n  \n \n  Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't\nmind her touching me.\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?\n  \n \n  I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed\n   \n   it\n   \n  because I didn't\nwant the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose,\ndirection or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could\nkick the habit\u2014perhaps with Miss Casey's help\u2014but I wasn't really\nconfident.\n  \n \n  Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material\nneeds would not grow and roast coffee.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  The Code was rigid\u2014no fraternization with the\n   \n  peoples of other planets!

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning.

        "Summary_1": "Evelyn was very close with her father as a child and she has a lot of warm memories of their moments together. Her father was the commander of the Defender, a powerful man, Lord Kane. He wanted to save his daughter by putting her on the last ship leaving the Defender, but she decided to stay and die with her people. This decision impressed her father, and after a brief evaluation he decided to make use of her and give her the most important task - explode both ships. Therefore, their relationship is both caring but professional and with the feeling of duty. While resolving to press the button, Evelyn remembered her father and that helped her decision. After her escape and getting to the Viscount she had to end her relationship with her father by shooting him. Trembling, full of emotions and desire to save him, Evelyn was still able to shoot as she didn't see another positive solution for them both. She felt sad and sorry, but she felt she did the right think and would soon join her father in death.",
        "Summary_2": "Along with her father, she watched The Defender grow into a planet-sized battle globe over the course of 20 years. The Defender was commanded by her father, Gordon. Evelyn cares for her father. She is honest and mimics his passion for the war. When she was a little girl her father would play with her and read her bedtime stories, memories that she treasures. While Evelyn and her father had a good relationship and she held no ill will towards him, she eventually kills him with Perat\u2019s gun at his orders. She does so through the justification that she cannot complete her mission if she tries to save him. ",
        "Summary_3": "Evelyn and her father have a strong relationship, primarily bonded by their passion and willingness to die for their planet. Evelyn grew up witnessing Kane's success in expanding the Defender, and she took on a similar duty for the planet,  evident when she promised to die there, destroying the planet and the two at war before doing so. Kane admires his daughter for doing this. Despite Evelyn's good relationship with her father, she ultimately ends up killing him for the sake of her duty, as he becomes a prisoner of the Scythian and Evelyn is ordered to execute him. ",
        "Summary_4": "Evelyn and her father both are fighting for the Terrans. Her father wanted her to board the last ship leaving The Defender, however, Evelyn wants to stay behind to fight. While her father does not want her to stay, he approves it and reminds her that if she is to die, die usefully. Then Evelyn is tasked with pressing the final button of the battle by her father. This will give her a chance to survive, not only because she is Gordon\u2019s father, but also because she will be tasked with the secret of the Terrans. Later when Evelyn finally gets to meet the Viscount on the balcony, he orders her to kill the last Terran living within The Defender, her father. Evelyn did not want to do this, but given the circumstances, she has to, and she says that soon she will join him. "

        "Query": "How did Evelyn use her feminine charm and Scythian tricks to survive and escape in Stalemate In Space?",
        "Article": "Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathing\nhard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best,\nfinding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during the\ninterval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk that\nclutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.\n  \n \n  She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.\n  \n \n  Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were still\nintact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself,\nset the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were\nunsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian\nenemies.\n  \n \n  Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly.\nThe cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on the\nchaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform.\nThen she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun the\nsealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling on\nthe side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly\nto her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve\nof her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring\nthe surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she\nwas alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the\ncubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling\nfrom her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle\nto come would be her apparent harmlessness.\n  \n \n  Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born\nScythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that\nof a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black\nstumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had\nsupplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.\n  \n \n  The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and\nevidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:\nShould he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two\nmonths since he had seen a woman.

The top of the\ncubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a\nrib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of\nknowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.\nFor a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Die now\u2014die now\u2014die now\n   \n  \u2014\"\n  \n \n  The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and\nit was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great\nbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this\ntiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain\nher countrymen had either definitely won\u2014or lost.\n  \n \n  The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had\nexpected nothing else.\n  \n \n  She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would\nset in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,\nand the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless\ngrave of space.\n  \n \n  But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon\nimmediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily\nover the memories of her past.\n  \n \n  For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized\nbattle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian\nglobe,\n   \n   The Invader\n   \n  , sprang out of black space to enslave the budding\nTerran Confederacy,\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  was unfinished, half-equipped, and\nundermanned.\n  \n \n  The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.\n  \n \n \n   The Defender\n   \n  , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled\nitself from its orbit around Procyon and met\n   \n   The Invader\n   \n  with giant\nfission torpedoes.\n  \n \n  And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic\nCloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men\npoured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken\n   \n   Defender\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal\nand terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the\nScythians nine years to conquer\n   \n   The Defender's\n   \n  outer shell. Then had\ncome that final interview with her father.\n  \n \n  \"In half an hour our last space port will be captured,\" he had\ntelepathed curtly. \"Only one more messenger ship can leave\n   \n   The\nDefender\n   \n  . Be on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I shall die here.\"\n  \n \n  His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. \"Then\ndie usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will\ndestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are\nsuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the\nbattle.\"\n  \n \n  \"There's an off-chance you may survive,\" countered a mentor. \"We're\nalso working on a means for your escape\u2014not only because you are\nGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent\nradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with\nour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you must expect to die,\" her father had warned with gentle\nfinality.\n  \n \n  She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched\nherself back to the present.\n  \n \n  That time had come.\n  \n \n  With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on\nthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with\nboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo\nfissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the\nship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing\nwould she die.\n  \n \n  She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in\ndismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds\nand was lying on its side.

No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained\nsuch gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand\nfeet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable\nalienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully\nin the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with\nsomething like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff\nwere somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some\nstrange and alien way.\n  \n \n  It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for\ninter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of\nmystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave\nher birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was\nunthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she\nwas drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung\nabout Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away\nagain into the inter-stellar deeps.\n  \n \n  Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps\nyesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip\nthat bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We\nwould never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond\nthe ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know\nwhat killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she\nwas mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ...\nbut of what?\n  \n \n  We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would\nhave meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better\nequipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by\nmen. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank.\nLet the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and\nbrought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things\nfigured.\n  \n \n  The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed\nby the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared\na boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth\nmillions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and\ncrossed to her.\n  \n \n  In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their\nfaces.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit\nher tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives.\nShe's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage\ncompartments that are still unbroken.\"\n  \n \n  She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was\nnothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull\nalone was left.\n  \n \n  He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples\nof her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this\nstuff....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The\ncarcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and\nZaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her\ndown under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check\nthose compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When\nit's done report to me in my quarters.\"\n  \n \n  I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a\nmetallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff\nis worth anything....\"\n  \n \n  The metal was heavy\u2014too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship\nconstruction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that\ndistant world where this metal was made?\n  \n \n  Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal\ntorn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver;\nthose strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were\nthere too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of\nthe metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand.\n   \n   It had a\nyellowish tinge, and it was heavier\n   \n  ....\n  \n \n  Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held\nit grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm.\nSuddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It\nstruck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of\nmetallic lustre.\n  \n \n  For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying\nall the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a\nbalance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It\nwas no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The\nwhorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing\nvibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had\ndrawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal\u2014the\nstuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was\nbuilt\u2014was now....\n  \n \n \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my\ntable-top.\n   \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps,\nfrom some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ...\ndrawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability\nin its new environment. Stability as a terrene element\u2014wonderfully,\nmiraculously gold!\n  \n \n  And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of\nthis metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have\nbeen a wild sound in those moments of discovery....\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended\nfrom the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly\nbe high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a\nsimilar ability in a mere clerk.\n  \n \n  Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildings\nwere still smoking, and many of the radions high above were either\nshot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor of\nradiation-remover was everywhere.\n  \n \n  She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.\n  \n \n  \"What is that?\" she asked the transport attendant.\n  \n \n  \"The Commandant is shooting prisoners,\" he replied laconically.\n  \n \n  \"Oh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where did you want to go?\"\n  \n \n  \"To the personnel office.\"\n  \n \n  \"That way.\" He pointed to the largest building of the group\u2014two\nstories high, reasonably intact.\n  \n \n  She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and there\nwith dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door and\nwas admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyed\nher stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscene\ncoughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.\n  \n \n  A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whispered\nsomething to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.\n  \n \n  In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelyn\nfrowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Under\ncertain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.\n  \n \n  The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of some\nsort, who was studying her visa.\n  \n \n  \"I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria\u2014ah\u2014\"\u2014he looked at the visa\nsuspiciously\u2014\"S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to\nS'ria Gerek, here\"\u2014he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back\u2014\"I\nwish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether\nthey want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to\nH.Q.?\"\n  \n \n  She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given\nsome answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It\nwould have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in\nhis eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had\ncombed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring\nthe narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided\nyellow hair. He was studying her covertly.\n  \n \n  \"The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,\" she said\nsimply. \"I was told that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , that is, I mean\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate\nloudly into her mechanical transcriber.\n  \n \n  Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort,\nmanaged a delicate flush. \"I meant to say, I thought I would be happier\nworking for\u2014working here. So I asked for a transfer.\"\n  \n \n  S'ria Gorph beamed. \"Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet,\nyou know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before we\ncut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well\"\u2014winking\nartfully\u2014\"and I'll see that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and\nanxiety. He appeared to listen.\n  \n \n  Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was\ncertain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The\nchances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length\nof time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all\npossible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen\npersonal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest in\nthe lowly employees that amused Gorph.\n  \n \n  Gorph looked at her uncertainly. \"Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns,\nsends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony.\" He\npointed to a hallway. \"All the way through there, across to the other\nwing.\"\n  \n \n  As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and\ncalculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could\nfeel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then that\nthe Faeg had ceased firing.\n  \n<doc-sep>Reno Ulrich's tiny scout plane buzzed slowly in from the distance and\nbegan circling lazily.\n  \n \n  \"Sooner than you think,\" Max told her. \"We've discovered a castaway\ncolony on the planet. They've done our tests for us by just living\nhere. If there's anything here to catch, they've caught it.\"\n  \n \n  \"People on Minos?\" Bess's handsome ruddy face grew alive with\nexcitement.\n  \n \n  \"One of them is down in the medical department,\" June said. \"He'll be\nout in twenty minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I go see him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Max. \"Show him the way to the dining hall when he gets\nout. Tell him we sent you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right!\" She turned and ran down the ramp like a small girl going to a\nfire. Max grinned at June and she grinned back. After a year and a half\nof isolation in space, everyone was hungry for the sight of new faces,\nthe sound of unfamiliar voices.\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  The Code was rigid\u2014no fraternization with the\n   \n  peoples of other planets!

        "Summary_1": "First, she decided to appear harmless in the struggle and left her weapon in the cubicle. She took only three things in a small bag with her when exiting her spot. Then she detected a corporal and when facing him, stretched luxuriously to change his mind to shoot her or notify his man. That was a manipulation of a woman using her charm not to get killed. When he didn't expect it, she mentally attacked the corporal to death and put on his clothes. This was her Scythian trick. When Evelyn met the inquisitor and the guards, she analyzed their minds again and with a little use of her feminine charm she pretended to be willing to give some interesting information  to the inquisitor one on one. That way she got rid of the guards, also by challenging the inquisitor asking to stay one on one if he is not afraid. Then she forced his mind to answer her questions and fill the blanks for her passage to the Occupational Commandant as a clerk and set her free. Then his memory and the guards' about her were deleted by her force of mind. When she reached the supervisor of her transfer, she made up a legend about its reasons as another trick. She complained about the men in the fighting zones and appealed to the supervisor's ego by claiming she had been told he was a better boss. When it came to Perat she followed his orders and even killed her father. She was humble and seductive and gained his trust and attention, which was her feminine trick again. In the very end she used a trick of a dangerous perfume given by her mentors. She used it not to be set up by the inquisitor. ",
        "Summary_2": "Evelyn uses many tricks to ensure her safety in precarious situations. She sues her sexual appeal often. In one situation she sues her sexual appeal to distract a man from instantly killing her, giving her the opportunity to stealthy sneak upon him and kill him. \n\nIn addition to sexual appeal, she uses her telepathic capabilities to force people to carry out her wishes. She receives a visa for travel using her telepathic skills. Evelyn is careful with her telepathic capabilities when she reaches the Occupational Commandment as she correctly believes that there will be others that have the ability. \n\nAt the end of the story, Evelyn arms herself with perfume to prevent a prisoner from publicly identifying her at his death execution appeal. The perfume is capable of drowning a person if they have active adrenals. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Evelyn uses a combination of her smarts and her telepathic ability to stay alive and undercover. When she initially steps outside, she lures a Scythian man to her, and uses telepathic paralysis to kill him and take his uniform. She also uses telepathy and mind control on the Inquisitor, who is able to give her information and allow her to travel to the Occupational Commandant. Once there, however, her telepathy skills are less useful because the people she is surrounded by have higher capabilities than her and she must be unassuming. So, to maintain her cover, Evelyn plays along to the commands of the Scythian.",
        "Summary_4": "First, when Evelyn first leaves the cubicle, she detects a low-born Scythe four hundred yards behind her. She uses her telepathic skills and found that the Scythian corporal is taking a mop-up squad through the forest. Knowing that he wondered if he should kill or not, she made him follow her. And then she performs telepathic cortical paralysis on the man which made him drop unconsciously.\n\nLater, when the inquisitor, along with his two guards, were questioning her, she told the inquisitor to ask the guards to leave. Then she paralyzed the mind of the inquisitor to finds out the Occupational Commandant of this Sector. Before she makes them let her go, she controls the inquisitor to give him a visa for a woman clerk. Later, at the personnel office she pretends to be blushed and lies about her reason to transfer here. And when she goes to the balcony, she has to pretend to not know the man she has to kill, her father. "

We were,\nafter all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more\nI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty\nredsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly\nand asked: \"Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Harvey explained. \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much did it cost us?\"\n  \n \n  Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're\nright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after\nall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\"\n  \n \n  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on\nMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Goldbricks!\n   \n  \" Harvey said succinctly.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>My eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a\nrecess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with\nthe absence of starlight.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What happened?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"The door to this damned place closed,\" I explained.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Before we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a\nbrilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.\n  \n \n  The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The\nceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the\nsmooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.\n  \n \n  The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and\ninstruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.\n  \n \n  Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door\nthat had imprisoned us.\n  \n \n  \"Miller!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"See if you can get this thing open from the outside.\"\n  \n \n  I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There\nwere no visible recesses or controls.\n  \n \n  Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a\nrough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened\nbreaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;\nMiller's was faltering and weak.\n  \n \n  \"Miller, get help!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll\u2014\" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll phone Lunar City.\" My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and\ntrembled beneath the thick gloves.\n  \n \n  I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....\n  \n \n  Static grated against my ear drums.\n  \n \n \n   Static!\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Shock momentarily immobilized Chip. Not so the bartender. He was, it\nseemed, an ardent pacifist. With a bleat of panic fear he scampered\nfrom his post, his metallic stilts clattering off in the distance.\nChip's accuser moved forward from the shadows; dim light illumined his\nfeatures. And\u2014\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Johnny!\n   \n  \" Chip's voice lifted in a note of jubilant surprise.\n\"Johnny Haldane\u2014you old scoundrel! Where in the void did\n   \n   you\n   \n  drop\nfrom?\"\n  \n \n  The S.S.P. man chuckled and returned Chip's greeting with a\nbone-grinding handclasp.\n  \n \n  \"I might ask the same of you, chum! Lord, it's been ages since we've\ncrossed 'jectory! When I saw you meandering across the Casino, you\ncould have knocked me down with a jetblast! What's new? Is old Syd\nstill with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're still shipmates. But he's back at the spaceport. The jerry-crew\nis plating our crate with ek, and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Ek! Plating a private cruiser!\" Haldane stared at him in astonishment,\nthen whistled. \"Sweet Sacred Stars, you must be filthy with credits to\nbe able to coat an entire ship with ekalastron!\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" boasted Chip, \"ain't heard nothing yet!\" And he told him how\nthey had discovered an entire mountain of the previous new element, No.\n97 in the periodic table, on frigid Titania, satellite of far Uranus.\n\"It was touch-and-go for a while,\" he admitted, \"whether we'd be the\nluckiest three guys in space\u2014or the deadest! But we passed through the\nflaming caverns like old Shadrach in the Bible\u2014remember?\u2014and here we\nare!\"\n  [1]\n  \n \n  Haldane was exuberant. \"A mountain of ekalastron!\" he gloated.\n\"That's the greatest contribution to spaceflight since Biggs'\nvelocity-intensifier!\" It was no overstatement. \"Element No. 97 was a\nmetal so light that a man could carry in one hand enough to coat the\nentire hull of a battleship\u2014yet so adamant that a gossamer film of\nit would deflect a meteor! A metal strong enough to crush diamonds to\nash\u2014but so resilient that, when properly treated, it would rebound\nlike rubber! What are you going to do with it, Chip? Put it on the\nopen market?\"\n  \n \n  Warren shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Not exactly. We talked it over carefully\u2014Syd and Salvation and I\u2014and\nwe decided there are some space-rats to whom it shouldn't be made\navailable. Privateers and outlaws, you know. So we turned control of\nthe mines over to the Space Patrol at Uranus, and visiphoned the Earth\nauthorities we were bringing in one cargo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Visiphoned!\" interrupted Haldane sharply. \"Did you say visiphoned?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014why, yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"From where?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, just before we reached the Belt. We don't have a very strong\ntransmitter, you know. Sa-a-ay, what's all the excitement, pal? Did we\ndo something that was wrong?\"\n  \n \n  Haldane frowned worriedly. \"I don't know, Chip. It wasn't anything\n   \n   wrong\n   \n  , but what you did was damned dangerous. For if your message was\nintercepted, you may have played into the very hands of\u2014the Lorelei!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Shano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n  \n \n  \"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\n  \n \n  Giddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n  \n \n  \"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\n  \n \n  Shano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Stardust's\n   \n  mechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\n  \n \n  Shano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\n  \n \n  The engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\n  \n \n  The speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and thought.\n  \n<doc-sep>When it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low,\nobviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the\noutpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the\nblazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over\nExtrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled\ninto the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its\nblasts.\n  \n \n  Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat\ndisgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.\n  \n \n  Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking\nofficers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce,\nthe officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and\nknees almost stiff.\n  \n \n  \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked.\n  \n \n  They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone\ndemanded, ominously not raising his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it's another alien ship. It was sighted\na few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone's face looked much too innocent. \"How did it get there,\ngentlemen? Why wasn't it destroyed?\"\n  \n \n  \"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\" Extrone mocked.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could\nlocate and destroy it.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned\naway, in the direction of a resting bearer. \"You!\" he said. \"Hey! Bring\nme a drink!\" He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. \"I'm\nstaying here.\"\n  \n \n  The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. \"But, sir....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone toyed with his beard. \"About a year ago, gentlemen, there was\nan alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it,\ndidn't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll destroy this one, too,\" Extrone said.\n  \n \n  \"We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through. But it might try a\nlong range bombardment, sir.\"\n  \n",

I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had\nto think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for\nme. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw\nand ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a\nman, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n  \n \n  No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange\nplanet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see\nthat space exploration\n   \n   made\n   \n  a man a reckless fool by doing things on\none planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n  \n \n  The thought intruded itself:\n   \n   why\n   \n  hadn't I recognized this before I\nlet Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted\nhim dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and\nrecognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n  \n \n  I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very\nwell be true, but how did that help now?\n  \n \n  I had to\n   \n   think\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane\nreasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,\nthere were only two opinions, his and mine.

He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\nSlimeheads remember the H. M. S.\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  fiasco, for example, in which a\ngalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\nshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\nthe\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\nof the\n   \n   Benjo Maru\n   \n  incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\nhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\n   \n   Saccharomycodes\n   \n  yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\nPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\nthe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\nbite he ate to a superior grade of\n   \n   sake\n   \n  . And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\n   \n   Charles Partlow\nSale\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Sale\n   \n  blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be planted\nin the\n   \n   maria\n   \n  to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n  \n \n  Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n  \n \n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n   \n   C. P. Sale\n   \n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n  \n \n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n  \n \n  The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in.

He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh.

You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus.

He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot!

        "Query": "What is the storyline of THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS?",
        "Article": " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>There being only three seats in the\n   \n   Sale's\n   \n  mess compartment, we ate\nour meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to\nsupper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell\nto make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,\nof cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss\nof canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the\nfirst-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"\n  \n \n  \"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman\nsaid.\n  \n \n  I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric\nwarming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of\nus with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried\nChlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched\nin a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron\nskillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut\na bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are\nlimits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the\ngalley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\"\nI said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is\nactually\n   \n   good\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.\n  \n \n  I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but\nthis is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;\nyou couldn't have done it without him.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\"\nBailey asked.\n  \n \n  \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our\nCaptain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\nperformance out of his Ship's Cook.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\nHe persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\nof the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\nspearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll\nhave to admit that I do.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\nplate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me\nstrangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth\nseemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an\nodd quality.\n  \n \n  \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb\nout of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some\ngaiety.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room\nfirst and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Allez\n   \n  ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean\n   \n   allons\n   \n  , or maybe\n   \n   alors\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered\nhim; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more.\n  \n \n \n   Oh, well\n   \n  , he thought,\n   \n   if I succeed in this job, no one at home will\nquibble.\n   \n \n \n  And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular\nenough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to\nshow the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n  \n \n  \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his\ncontours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but\nhis face burned. \"I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered\nhimself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a\ncigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not\ntoo late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around\n2100 hours earliest.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and\nswivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?\nExotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"\nHis tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened\nuncertain lips.\n  \n \n  \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an\nabandoned canal.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does\nshe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend\nyou buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n  \n \n  \"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n   \n   Ante\n   \n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n   \n   Post\n   \n  .\n  \n \n \n \n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland.

TROY\n  \n \n \n   A world-famed Earth scientist had disappeared on Venus.\n    \n   When Johnson found him, he found too the secret to that\n    \n   globe-shaking mystery\u2014the fabulous Room of The Dreaming.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories November 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The city dripped with rain. Crossing the street toward the dive,\nJohnson got rain in his eyes, his nose, and his ears. That was the way\nwith the rain here. It came at you from all directions. There had been\noccasions when Johnson had thought the rain was falling straight up.\nOtherwise, how had the insides of his pants gotten wet?\n  \n \n  On Venus, everything came at you from all directions, it seemed to\nJohnson. Opening the door of the joint, it was noise instead of rain\nthat came at him, the wild frantic beat of a Venusian rhumba, the\nnotes pounding and jumping through the smoke and perfume clouded room.\nFeeling states came at him, intangible, but to his trained senses,\nperceptible emotional nuances of hate, love, fear, and rage. But mostly\nlove. Since this place had been designed to excite the senses of both\nhumans and Venusians, the love feelings were heavily tinged with\nstraight sex. He sniffed at them, feeling them somewhere inside of him,\naware of them but aware also that here was apprehension, and plain fear.\n  \n \n  Caldwell, sitting in a booth next to the door, glanced up as Johnson\nentered but neither Caldwell's facial expression or his eyes revealed\nthat he had ever seen this human before. Nor did Johnson seem to\nrecognize Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Is the mighty human wanting liquor, a woman or dreams?\" His voice\nwas all soft syllables of liquid sound. The Venusian equivalent of a\nheadwaiter was bowing to him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have a tarmur to start,\" Johnson said. \"How are the dreams\ntonight?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ze vill be the most wonserful of all sonight. The great Unger hisself\nwill be here to do ze dreaming. There is no ozzer one who has quite\nhis touch at dreaming, mighty one.\" The headwaiter spread his hands\nin a gesture indicating ecstasy. \"It is my great regret that I must do\nze work tonight instead of being wiz ze dreamers. Ah, ze great Unger\nhisself!\" The headwaiter kissed the tips of his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said. \"The great Unger!\" His voice expressed surprise,\njust the right amount of it. \"I'll have a tarmur to start but when does\nthe dreaming commence?\"\n  \n \n  \"In one zonar or maybe less. Shall I make ze reservations for ze mighty\none?\" As he was speaking, the headwaiter was deftly conducting Johnson\nto the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Not just yet,\" Johnson said. \"See me a little later.\"\n  \n \n  \"But certainly.\" The headwaiter was gone into the throng. Johnson was\nat the bar. Behind it, a Venusian was bowing to him. \"Tarmur,\" Johnson\nsaid. The green drink was set before him. He held it up to the light,\nadmiring the slow rise of the tiny golden bubbles in it. To him,\nwatching the bubbles rise was perhaps more important than drinking\nitself.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful, aren't they?\" a soft voice said. He glanced to his right.\nA girl had slid into the stool beside him. She wore a green dress cut\nvery low at the throat. Her skin had the pleasant tan recently on\nEarth. Her hair was a shade of abundant brown and her eyes were blue,\nthe color of the skies of Earth. A necklace circled her throat and\nbelow the necklace ... Johnson felt his pulse quicken, for two reasons.\nWomen such as this one had been quickening the pulse of men since the\ndays of Adam. The second reason concerned her presence here in this\nplace where no woman in her right mind ever came unescorted. Her eyes\nsmiled up at him unafraid. Didn't she know there were men present here\nin this space port city who would snatch her bodily from the bar\nstool and carry her away for sleeping purposes?

        "Summary_1": "Captain Gavin and Ordinary Spaceman Quade have an argument about the blank video screen during a space exploration mission. Quade claims it is a transphasia and Captain doubts it. When the dispute gets tense, the two of them go out to find the reason for the blackout. There they smell and taste the beauty. Suddenly, a streak of spice shoots and the captain feels pain. After another short fight the two decide to go back to the spacer. There the captain has a chat with First Officer Nagurski, an ex-captain, about making Gavin's relationship with the crew better. Quade joins, and next steps towards transphasia are discussed with the final decision of the captain to tear apart the ship as it is the only protection. Many disagree again, and Quade goes out somewhere alone without a cable. Gavin blames himself for not seeing Quade's intentions and plans to follow. The crew plans on fighting the noise with music outside and increasing smell and taste by drinking wine. After these preparations, a part of the crew moves out following the cable to search for Quade. Soon they find him lying in the dust with frostbite and heat prostration. Near the ship, lizard-like aliens stand in the crew's way. A short beating occurs, and soon the captain is talking to Quade in the infirmary about the past experience. Turns out the aliens were trying to help and desired to be colonized. Quade acknowledges his mistakes and loses his confidence, for which he is demoted by the captain.",
        "Summary_2": "Gavin is the Captain of a spaceship that is set to explore planets and aliens. However, Transphasia, an electrogravitational disturbance that rechannels incoming sense data to the wrong receptive areas, is affecting the video screen on their ship. Quade, an Ordinary Spaceman on the spaceship, does not believe Gavin\u2019s assumption that the alien race might be interfering with their exploration. Quade argues that, from experience, aliens generally do not even recognize their existence. Gavin asserts that Quade relies too much on tradition and experience that he is becoming careless. But Quade states that Gavin is an outsider. Not able to persuade the other, they decided to find out the reason that lead to this video screen blackout. \n\nGoing onto the desert at where they landed, Gavin started to experience Transphasia, where he tastes the views and smell the colors; while on the other hand, Quade seems to have accustomed to the strange senses. Suddenly, some kind of spice goes pass the two of them along with a second-long pain, and Quade was so curious that he dragged Gavin toward the direction of the spice, mentioning that they are an exploration party after all when Gavin ordered him to stop. After getting back to the spaceship, Nagurski, a former Captain and currently a First Officer, disputes with Gavin about trusting the Spacemen and arguing over the degree of specificity that an order should be. \n\nAfter informing Gavin their only way to escape from Transphasia, Gavin refuses and mentions another way, which is to take the spaceship apart. Nagurski is shocked and commented Gavin as being too cautious and it should not be done this way. But Gavin continued. He was then informed by Wallace, the personnel man, that Quade has left the spaceship alone by himself. Gavin is enraged and starts to plan the rescue. He asks Wallace to bring some light wine to the Spacemen to improve their taste and smell. Then Nagurski, Gavin and a few others, went to find Quade. On their way back, they came into direct contact with aliens, who tried to help the men; realizing that other men can provide better help, the aliens left. ",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Gavin and Ordinary Spacemen Quade are in an argument over transphasia. Gavin tries to demonstrate his superiority and title when Quade tells him he is wrong about the definition of transphasia. After a couple more jabs regarding experience as a spaceman and title, the two of them investigate the problem together. They begin to experience transphasia, and it turns out that Quade is correct about the color. Quade pulls him to explore further, and streaks of spice go past them only to come back and make a bitter rip. Gavin does not want to go further from the spacer, but Quade does not mind because he is an experienced spaceman. However, he stays silent once he sees how deep the freefall is. Later, Gavin has a conversation with First Officer Naguski, who claims that he has lots of experience with transphasia. Nagurski then offers advice on how a captain should treat his crew. Gavin argues that one cannot trust anything in space, while Nagurski argues that it is essential for trust to go both ways. Quade then comes in with a plan, and he explains how they would need to keep physical contact with the spaceship and suggests using a cable. Gavin decides to rip apart the spaceship instead, which Nagurski believes is terrible because it would be impossible to assemble again if there were too many missing parts. While Gavin stubbornly sticks to his plan, the personnel man Wallace informs him that Quade has already gone past the three-mile limit. He decides to go after him, finally recognizing that Quade is an essential member of the crew. Quartermaster Farley tells Gavin that he has nothing to worry about, and they discuss plans to combat transphasia. Gavin tells Farley to prepare music and give the men alcohol for medical purposes when they set off to find Quade. Once they are in the area where Quade is, they see and try to haul him back to the spaceship as soon as they can. On the way back, they run into an alien herd. Quade begins to jog towards it, and the others agree to lend him a hand to catch a specimen. The herd starts to close in on them, which eventually puts the group at a significant disadvantage. Gavin is the only sober person, as everybody else has either become knocked out, passed out, or forced to take cover. Later, Gavin visits Quade in the infirmary and tells him that he is having the spaceship put together again. Gavin explains that the aliens they encountered earlier were friendly and tried to help the spacemen. Furthermore, the aliens want them to colonize the planet. Quade blames his arrogance for his near-death experience, but Gavin tells him that confidence is a spaceman\u2019s most important asset. He then demotes Quade to Acting Executive Officer and says that Quade worries too much about how dangerous space is to explore.",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Gavin and First Officer Quade are on a very strange planet. This planet is very strange and it changes a person's senses, this is known as \"transphasia\" it also affects radar equipment. Gavin and Quade fight over rank, as Quade is more experienced, but Gavin is captain. They go out for a walk on the surface of this strange planet and their senses begin to get muddled. They hear a wailing call that quickly disappears, and then see a flash of light that travels into a canyon. They think this flash is a substance known as \"spice\". They make their way to the canyon to investigate, tasting colours and hearing sight, but once they reach the canyon, they decide they can't go any further. \nBack at the ship, they converse with first officer Naugurski. Gavin can't understand why the crew don't respect him, he explains to Gavin that he would have to earn the crew's respect. Quade mentioned there's only one way to make it through trasplasia, and that's to keep in contact with the ship at all times. They start to break apart the ship, so that they can put it together in a way that the whole crew will be in constant contact with the ship on a second journey together, to make it to the canyon. As they are working, Wallace, one of the personel men, tells Gavin that Quade has gone out on his own. They plan a rescue mission to save him. They think he will go beyond the three mile limit. Gavin comes up with a plan to stay oriented. They will drink wine to sharpen their sense of sight, and they will stay connected to each other through a cable. After some searching on the surface of the planet, and hearing the wailing call again, they find Quade. They haul him back in weak condition. They are met back at the ship by a group of Aliens, one of whom starts to jump on Quade, flattening him. They manage to pull Quade out of there, and when the two men talk about it later in the ship, Gavin says that the Aliens were trying to figure out what was wrong with Quade, and to help him. They let Quade go when they knew that the crew could help him more than they could. Gavin demotes Quade but they build a new sense of comradery. "

There was no time to judge its size, if it had\nsize, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp\npain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n  \n \n  The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I\ncouldn't quite make out.\n  \n \n  Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think\nyou're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n  \n \n  He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was?

Callahan knew it.\nBy now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\ninquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\n  \n \n  Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\nmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly\nsaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\nsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\nhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\nthat way.\n  \n \n  She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\neither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\nO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\nof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I\ncouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.\nSo I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\nnaturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned\nresetting the control.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\ncomes down the passage?\"\n  \n \n  Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin.

Don't try to\nchange course.\"\n  \n \n  The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\n  \n \n  \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\nthe desk, gripped the captain's wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he\neased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\ndrawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\n  \n \n  \"You busted it, you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\nhoods.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't put it over, hick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\nhe said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\nthe mike and looked up at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\nto sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\n  \n \n  Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door.\n  \n \n  \"Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's\ngoing on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with\na sick friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\n  \n \n  Retief settled himself in a chair.\n  \n \n  \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I'm going to\nstay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.\"\n  \n \n  The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel\nlike dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don't mind me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.\n  \n \n  \"If anything happens that I don't like,\" he said, \"I'll wake you up.\nWith this.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Quade holds the captain in low regard, he believes to be much more experienced and knowledgeable and disagrees with Gavin's decisions. Therefore, Quade doesn't want to obey the captain and constantly confronts him. Gavin, in turn, wants to be obeyed and considers his position enough reason to ask for that. The captain is new to the crew and he doesn't try to get closer to it, while all the other members have known each other for a while. Moreover, the captain constantly takes risks and suggests new methods, in which the crew and Quade are not sure. Gavin also feels jealous as the crew respects Quade much more than the captain himself. Quade acts on his own according to what he considers right, and Gavin has to fight him for leadership and make him obey, not to lose charge. Their relationship changes when Gavin starts blaming himself for Quade's leave and possible death, considering his own jealousy the reason of neglect. When he saves Quade, the least also changes his mind because he recognizes the foolishness of his actions and the two come to an agreement. ",
        "Summary_2": "The conflict between Captain and Quade started with Quade mentioning that this is the first trip for the Captain and accused of him being wrong at analyzing the reason that lead to the blackout on the video screen. The Captain argues that Quade has been relying too much on the tradition and the past experiences where he started to become careless; he supposed that Quade was busted to Ordinary Spaceman because of it and he is complacent. Quade repudiated that idea and called Captain an outsider. This conflict leads them to find out the reason that lead to this video screen blackout together. During the trip, Quade was so curious about a spice that passed not far from them that he dragged the Captain toward the direction of the spice, mentioning that they are an exploration party after all when the Captain ordered him to stop.\n\nAfterward, the Captain refuses to comply with Quade\u2019s escape plan from Transphasia; he comes up with a much unusual plan. Later, Quade has left the spaceship alone by himself, which gets the Captain enraged and thought about if he wanted him dead. But he still goes to rescue him fearing of more opinions from the spacemen if Quade is gone. Finally, after Quade is found, they meet some aliens who tried to help them by calling and warning them. They even offered one of their kind for the men to study. Then, Quade realizes that he has been arrogant and blind, and he apologize for his actions. The Captain tells Quade to keep up with his confidence even though he demoted him afterward. And he told Quade that the space isn\u2019t that dangerous. ",
        "Summary_3": "The reason behind Captain Gavin and Quade\u2019s conflict is that the Captain does not trust Quade\u2019s opinions. He believes himself superior to Quade and the rest of the crew because of his higher position as Captain, even though he is very inexperienced compared to many other crew members. He also refuses to compromise for the sake of other crew members, which causes him and Quade to clash constantly because of his stubbornness. This conflict initially develops for the worse, and Quade even goes to defy Gavin\u2019s orders because he believes that his experience will ensure his survival. However, Gavin does choose to rescue Quade, which is a turning point in their conflict. After Quade is rescued, Gavin has a much more positive attitude towards him and even offers words of encouragement. ",
        "Summary_4": "\nThe reason for the Captain and Quade's conflict is because while it is Captain Gavin's first space expedition, Quade has twenty years of experience under his belt. They argue over who is more knowledgeable, the captain obviously feeling threatened by Quade's experience. Quade hates that Gavin has the power to pull rank over him, and he sees him as a cocky newbie that doesn't have half the knowledge he possesses. They insult each other on a number of occasions. Quade tells the captain that he is nothing more than a figurehead to the men of the crew. When they go onto the planet's surface, they bicker about how to deal with the terrain. Their conflict is put to rest though after the captain saves Quade's life, and a sort of comradery is formed between them. \n"

Before the\ntape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt\nsomething dark and ominous in the outside air.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.\n\"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on\nthis channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain.\n   \n   You\n   \n  weren't giggling,\nsir?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n  \n \n  A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my\nshelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n  \n \n  The basso profundo performing\n   \n   Figaro\n   \n  on my headset climbed to a\ngirlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had\nfirst heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n  \n \n  \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a\n   \n   long\n   \n  time. Look again.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n  \n \n  I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It\n   \n   was\n   \n  Quade. A\nman in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead.\n  \n \n \n \n  Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.\nA hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed\non sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of\n   \n   Pomp and\nCircumstance\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n  \n \n  The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better\nget him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing\nbefore with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming\nwind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for\nthe cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n  \n \n  \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy\ntest lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what\nto do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what\nthey are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell\n   \n   you\n   \n  a thing,\nNagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no\nlonger a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less\nhuman nature. Even I know that much!\"\n  \n \n  He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n  \n \n  \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is\n   \n   obey\n   \n  me or, by\nJupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal\nback home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to\nthink of me\u2014of\n   \n   us\n   \n  , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the\ncrew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this\nship.\"\n  \n \n  \"He\n   \n   is\n   \n  a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his\nstatus.\"\n  \n \n  The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for\ngetting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head\nand stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's\npermission....\"\n  \n \n  \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n  \n \n  \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any\nreliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact\nwith the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,\nbut the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n  \n \n  \"How far can we run it back?\"\n  \n \n  Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n  \n \n  \"How many?\"\n  \n \n  \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,\nsmell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n  \n \n  \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change\nsites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n  \n \n  \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from\ntransphasia. Is that it?\"\n  \n \n  Quade gave a curt nod.\n  \n \n  \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said\nexpansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,\nBruce.

Dogs? Spacemen?

I was wondering why\n   \n   you\n   \n  did.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed\nme home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own\nmaster is the most content.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and\nstill be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd\nhave anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the\nreins on the men.

I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n  \n \n  He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many\nyears.

It was glowing cherry red.\n  \n \n  \"Let's go!\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n  \n \n  He and the Major reached the airlock at the same time and became\ntemporarily engaged with each other. Movement was somewhat ungainly\nin the space suits under the best of conditions, and now, with the\nnecessity for speed, was doubly so. The other two crashed into them\nfrom behind, and they spewed forth from the dome in a tangle of arms\nand legs.\n  \n \n  At the table, they separated, two going to the left, two to the right.\nThe table remained untouched.\n  \n \n  When they halted, Capt. Wilkins said, \"Get to one side, it may go off\nlike shrapnel.\" They obeyed.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014what\u2014what?\" Capt.

It's ... it's ...\nmelting, yes. Melting down at the bottom a little. Now it's falling\nover to one side and laying on the air tank. The air tank is getting\nred, too.

Wilkins leaped from his position.\nHe was still floating toward the ground when there was an incredibly\nbright flare from inside the dome, and a great, silent tongue of flame\nlashed through the airlock and rolled across the lunar surface. The\ntable was sent tumbling. The flame was gone almost instantly.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"There went the air,\" Capt. Lawler commented.\n  \n \n  \"We got T-Trouble,\" said Lt. Chandler.\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Nagurski used to be a captain and Gavin is now, though their methods and thoughts about this position differ.

Gavin tries to adapt to the new conditions, acting creatively and according to situation, while Nagurski sticks to old patterns and rules. Nagurski is afraid to risk, he opposes taking apart the ship, being afraid to lose too many parts. Nagurski is neither afraid for Quade going out alone as he believes in the least, while the captain heads to save the man. ",

Thus they will volunteer to have you as their Captain. He trust the men on the ship for making smart decisions, which will in turn make the men trust him as the Captain. On the other hand, this is Gavin\u2019s first mission ever, and he demands the men on the ship to follow his orders. He does not trust anyone in the ship, but only needs them to obey him. Moreover, he believes that the plan Gavin forms to escape the Transphasia is way too cautious, and he is risking the whole party. Gavin sees Nagurski as wanting a safer job. Gavin also thinks that Nagurski is now a First Officer instead of a Captain due to the fact that he trusted his Spacemen. However, Nagurski explains that he wants to relax a bit more and get a better pay than being a captain.  ",

Gavin often says that the rest of the crew must follow his plans, even when they are much riskier and are more of a stupid gamble than the alternative solutions. He also believes that he will always know what's best because he is the captain, no matter his crew's expertise. Gavin and his crew have a lack of trust, and he generally has a much more negative attitude. Even when Nagurski tries to give him advice, he tells the older man that he cannot have lazy, incompetent slobs running the spaceship. On the other hand, Nagurski, due to his experience, has more trust in the crew. Although he says that he was once the same as Gavin, he is now much calmer and more trusting. He believes that the trust between a crew and its captains must go both ways, which ultimately leads to a captain being accepted by his crew.",
        "Summary_4": "Gavin believes that to run a ship, you just need a crew to obey you. They don't have to like you, they don't even have to respect you, but they do have to follow the orders in which you give. Nagurski on the other hand believes that respect, a very important part about working as a captain on a spaceship, is won over. He believes that you must treat your crew with kindness and respect. You must make them see you as their friend, so that they pick you to be their leader, instead of you just being appointed theirs. You must trust them, as they trust you.

I was thankful\nfor the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the\ntape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt\nsomething dark and ominous in the outside air.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.\n\"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on\nthis channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain.\n   \n   You\n   \n  weren't giggling,\nsir?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n  \n \n  A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my\nshelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n  \n \n  The basso profundo performing\n   \n   Figaro\n   \n  on my headset climbed to a\ngirlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had\nfirst heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n  \n \n  \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a\n   \n   long\n   \n  time. Look again.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n  \n \n  I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It\n   \n   was\n   \n  Quade. A\nman in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead.\n  \n \n \n \n  Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.\nA hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed\non sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of\n   \n   Pomp and\nCircumstance\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n  \n \n  The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better\nget him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing\nbefore with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming\nwind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for\nthe cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had\nto think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for\nme. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw\nand ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a\nman, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n  \n \n  No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange\nplanet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see\nthat space exploration\n   \n   made\n   \n  a man a reckless fool by doing things on\none planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n  \n \n  The thought intruded itself:\n   \n   why\n   \n  hadn't I recognized this before I\nlet Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted\nhim dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and\nrecognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n  \n \n  I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very\nwell be true, but how did that help now?\n  \n \n  I had to\n   \n   think\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane\nreasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,\nthere were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have\nendless opinions to contend with.\n  \n \n  But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.\nThere was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to\nreach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten\nmiles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in\nspacesuits.\n  \n \n  But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n  \n \n  Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he\nwould be?\n  \n \n  How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable?\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.\n\"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's\nsolid.\"\n  \n \n  The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was\nunimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,\nso it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white\nsand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink\nsunlight.\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul\nas soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n  \n \n  \"Apparently, Quade,\n   \n   this\n   \n  thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n  \n \n  The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n  \n \n  The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my\nhead around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n  \n \n  But what else can you do with a wail but\n   \n   hear\n   \n  it?\n  \n \n  Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's\ntrace it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from\nwhat you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You\nmay begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing\ntastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of\nlanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n  \n \n  Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and\nstaying alive.\"\n  \n \n  There was no reply.\n  \n \n  His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and\nI knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our\npressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n  \n \n  We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our\nhides.\n  \n \n  The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting\ntreble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made\nyou feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever\ntasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under\nmy skin.\n  \n \n  \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n  \n \n  \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your\nwords about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,\nCaptain?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an\nilliscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n  \n \n  \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't\nfor our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of\nCentauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n  \n \n  It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the\nface of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you\nsmell them for the first time.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS\n  \n \n  By JIM HARMON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Now was the captain's chance to prove he knew\n    \n   less than the crew\u2014all their lives hung upon it!\n   \n \n \n \n  There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were\nlooking at it so analytically.\n  \n \n  \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with\na definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my\nword on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust\n   \n   anything\n   \n  . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n  \n \n  \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of\nhis scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you\nhaven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex\ndissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything\nyou like, it's still transphasia.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an\nelectrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling\nit to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also\neffects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n  \n \n  \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n  \n \n  \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many\nplanetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope\nmay mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never\ninterfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us\nthey can't even recognize our existence.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n  \n \n  \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy\ntest lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what\nto do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what\nthey are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell\n   \n   you\n   \n  a thing,\nNagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no\nlonger a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less\nhuman nature. Even I know that much!\"\n  \n \n  He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n  \n \n  \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is\n   \n   obey\n   \n  me or, by\nJupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal\nback home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to\nthink of me\u2014of\n   \n   us\n   \n  , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the\ncrew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this\nship.\"\n  \n \n  \"He\n   \n   is\n   \n  a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his\nstatus.\"\n  \n \n  The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for\ngetting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head\nand stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's\npermission....\"\n  \n \n  \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n  \n \n  \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any\nreliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact\nwith the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,\nbut the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n  \n \n  \"How far can we run it back?\"\n  \n \n  Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n  \n \n  \"How many?\"\n  \n \n  \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,\nsmell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n  \n \n  \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change\nsites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n  \n \n  \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from\ntransphasia. Is that it?\"\n  \n \n  Quade gave a curt nod.\n  \n \n  \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see\nirregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have\ncompensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of\nreference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all\nwe have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes\n   \n   bang\n   \n  and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n  \n \n  Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of\nspice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip\nbetween the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had\nsize, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp\npain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n  \n \n  The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I\ncouldn't quite make out.\n  \n \n  Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think\nyou're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n  \n \n  He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This\n   \n   is\n   \n  an\nexploration party, you know, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't\nlike the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any\nfurther from the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's important, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until\nwe got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want\nit to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but\nit would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to\nfree-fall.\"\n  \n \n  But he turned back.\n  \n \n  \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want\nto see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational\njamming here.\"\n  \n \n  I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.\nSweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n  \n \n  Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He\nwas reading the map too.\n  \n \n  The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.\nThere was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had\nknown for an instant as a streak of spice.\n  \n \n  \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough\nto get used to it.\"\n  \n \n  He said nothing on the route back to the spacer.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,\neyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n  \n \n  \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to\nLethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last\ntime anybody would ever board the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  alive. His stomach\nwent flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n  \n \n  If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end\nof shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind\nsearching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like\na smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,\nwater-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy\njet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be\neliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored\nbecause of his gun.\n  \n \n  Kriere would make odds impossible.\n  \n \n  Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n  \n \n  Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,\nfooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n  \n \n  Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade\nwhere Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,\nartery\u2014heart.\n  \n \n  There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and\nthis would be the last trip.\n  \n \n  Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n  \n \n  \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there\nwas too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in\nthe center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the\nstar-port.\"\n  \n \n  Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.\nBurnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back\nkept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet\nsings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,\nwhy\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of\nstars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about\nto be rescued.\n  \n \n  Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he\nwas about to end a ten-years' war.\n  \n \n  There was only\n   \n   one\n   \n  way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be\nfast.\n  \n \n  Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as\nit had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a\ngood sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered\ndirections, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies\nfrom space.\n  \n \n  Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,\ntoo.\n  \n \n  The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its\nslowness.\n  \n \n  It reached Kriere.\n  \n \n  Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n  \n \n  The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lethla watched.\n  \n \n  He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You\nknow, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . I believe it.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "In the very beginning, Quade confronts the new captain in a challenging and harsh manner. Quade believes he knows everything better than the captain and neglects the least as he is a rookie. Quade goes out one on one with the captain to prove he was right about transphasia. When the two face it, Quade is trying to drag the captain towards transphasia, but has to follow the orders and return to the ship. He suggests to keep contact with the ship and run back the cable. His idea is declined and he recklessly goes out alone in a suit without the cable. There his senses are deceived and he is found lying in the dust and brought to the ship. Facing the aliens there, Quade approaches them and is beaten. He finds himself in an infirmary then and acknowledges his lack of judgement to the captain. He is demoted after and accepts this punishment. ",
        "Summary_2": "Quade first opposes Gavin\u2019s assumption that the alien race might be interfering with their exploration. Quade argues, from experience, aliens generally do not even recognize their existence. Disagreeing with Quade, Gavin asserts he is relying so much on tradition and experience that he is becoming careless. But Quade states that Gavin is an outsider. Tension is created between the two, and they decided to go and find out what lead to the blackout of the screen. Gavin expected to have Transphasia when they are outside of their spaceship, and explained to Gavin about it. When the spice passes the two, Quade gets curious, but he is stopped by Gavin. Later when he proposes an escape plan, it is refused by Gavin, which then leads to Quade going off alone, only bringing with him a suit and a cartographer unit. He is found, having frostbite and heat prostration, by Gavin and his rescue team.\n\nWhen the team and Quade came across aliens on their way back to the spaceship, Quade decides to show them that aliens cannot be harmful to them. However, he was wrong. After hitting Quade with its tail and injuring some others, the aliens finally left. In the infirmary, Quade is told that the aliens were trying to help, in their own ways, and when they realized that men can provide better help, they left. This makes Quade realize that he was a fool being so arrogant and blind. And he also learns that he has been demoted to Acting Executive Officer.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Throughout the story, Quade almost gets himself killed by the transphasia. He initially tries to propose a plan to Gavin, but the captain vehemently rejects it. After he is fed up with Captain Gavin, he decides to take the initiative and leave the spaceship to investigate on his own. He is confident in his own abilities, but this ends up getting him into trouble. Although he has a lot of experience, he admits that his arrogance and foolhardiness get him into trouble. The transphasia is a lot more dangerous than he initially assumes, and the Quartermaster even diagnoses him with frostbite and heat prostration when the team finds him. Later, he is able to recover in the infirmary.",
        "Summary_4": "Quade starts off the story by arguing with Captain Gavin. They decide to go out and explore the surface of the mysterious planet together. They make their way through the pyschadellic minefield of the planet, all the way down to a gorge, where they spot \"spice\". They decide to turn back at this moment, as the climb down would be too dangerous. Quade walks in on the conversation between Gavin and Nagurski, where he proposes an idea. He says that the only way to get through transphasia would be to keep in constant contact with the ship. all the men would be tied together on a line. Not long after this conversation, he decides to go out onto the terrain of the planet on his own, taking with him a suit and a cartographer unit. After a long time out in the terrain, he comes down with frostbite and heat prostration, and collapses on the ground. The crew find him and drag him back to base. When they see the aliens outside of the ship, Quade walks over to one to convince the men that they're docile. The alien begins to jump on him, flattening him, until the crew pull him away. He goes back to his bunk, where he and Gavin talk. Gavin demotes him, but they begin to become friends. "

Considering the mixed-up\nsensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are\ngoing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of\nwine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,\nand then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.\nI'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n  \n \n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n  \n \n  \"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n   \n   Ante\n   \n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n   \n   Post\n   \n  .\n  \n \n \n \n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was\nimpatient as well. \"All right, Stevenson,\" he said. \"Make it fast, I've\ngot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing\nof yours again.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid it is, Captain,\" said Stevenson. \"Did you see the morning\npaper?\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?\"\n  \n \n  Captain Hanks sighed. \"Stevenson,\" he said wearily, \"are you going to\ntry to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's\nthe problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'\" Stevenson told\nhim. \"One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the\nChallengers.\"\n  \n \n  \"So they changed their name,\" said Hanks.\n  \n \n  \"Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted\nthat much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever\nseeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"A bunch of juvenile delinquents,\" said Hanks in disgust. \"You take\ntheir word?\"\n  \n \n  \"Captain, did you read the article in the paper?\"\n  \n \n  \"I glanced through it.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started\nfighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once\nall the metal they were carrying\u2014knives and tire chains and coins and\nbelt buckles and everything else\u2014got freezing cold, too cold to touch.\nAnd then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to\npull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later\ncollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been\nbranded 'The Scorpion.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, let\n   \n   me\n   \n  tell\n   \n   you\n   \n  something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard\nthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they\nthrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been\npart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before\nthey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed\nup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it\nbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the\nneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not\nbothering anybody.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what happened. And all this talk about\nfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec\npunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to\nworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid\ngangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or\nyou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.\nNow, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n<doc-sep>Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and\nthought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the\ngirl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that\n   \n   was\n   \n  my name.\n  \n \n  \"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like\nwaterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help\n   \n   me\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.\n  \n \n  She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.\n\"What do you think of this?\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.\n  \n \n \n   Dear Acolyte R. I. S.\n   \n  :\n  \n \n \n   Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, \"The Scarlet\nBook\" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the Universe.\n   \n \n \n \n   Name\n   \n  : ........................\n  \n \n \n   Address\n   \n  : .....................\n  \n \n  The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner\nand Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.\n  \n \n  There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was\ntrying to pull it out.\n  \n \n  I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a\ncup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and\na pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five\u2014if the\nlady didn't pay you.\"\n  \n \n  \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that\nbill out of your hand?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman\nput down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant\nbar, smoothing it.\n  \n \n  I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the\nsidewalk, only in the doorways.\n  \n<doc-sep>They did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n  \n \n  \"I have to have a drink.\"\n  \n \n  Rat stared at her without answer.\n  \n \n  \"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n  \n \n  \"Heard you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\n  \n \n  She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\n  \n \n  They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\n  \n \n  She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n  \n \n  \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\n  \n \n  Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n  \n \n  \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n  \n \n  \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n  \n \n  \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\n  \n \n  Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\n  \n \n  No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\n   \n   upward\n   \n  , beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\n  \n \n  Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n  \n \n  \"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n  \n \n  \"And now, please, just\n   \n   how\n   \n  do I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Every conflict and dangerous mistake throughout the story was caused by the lack of unity among the characters. The confrontation between Gavin and Quade caused the two to go alone towards transphasia and put themselves in danger. Gavin's lack of desire to work on mutual trust with the crew caused their condemnation of his actions and disobedience during such ab dangerous mission. The mutual offenses and tense arguments between the captain and the crew turned the least to Quade's side. All of this led to Quade going out alone and approaching death, for what Gavin and the crew would blame the captain himself. The arguments between the captain and different members of the crew take a lot of time and the job is done unwillingly, making it not as productive as it could be. The final peace and cohesion, on the contrary, lead to saving Quade, dealing with the aliens and coming to an understanding. ",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, Gavin and Quade dispute over transphasia; not much was accomplished during their trip outside to prove their theories correct. Later, Gavin and Nagurski demonstrate their different opinions on the way of being captains. Clearly, they weren\u2019t content and only believed that they are correct. It was only until Gavin forms the rescue team, do they manage to achieve something. They are able to find Quade, who went off alone. Later, they see aliens. It is interesting to note that even the aliens are able to work as a team, forming a circle to enclose the rescue team and prevent them from escaping. In the end, Quade realizes that he has been arrogant and acted like a fool.",
        "Summary_3": "The significance of cohesion is that it brings together the entire crew. Initially, all of the characters are very disconnected from each other, and there is no teamwork on the spaceship. Instead, there are only conflicts, whether between Gavin and Quade or even Nagurski and Gavin. When they form a rescue team for Quade and initiate the plan, there is finally a sense of unity between the characters. The cohesion is significant because it provides Gavin with positive character development. As it played an important factor in his first mission, it also became an opportunity for him to learn how to be a better captain for the future.",
        "Summary_4": "Cohesion is perhaps the most important underlying theme of the story. At first, Captain Gavin is opposed to cohesion. He believes that he shouldn't trust anyone. He doesn't need the crew to like him, and he is completely fine separating himself emotionally from the rest of the men. Gavin and Quade are not a cohesive pair at the beginning of the story. They argue and try to pull rank on one another, both from intellect and experience. Nagurski explains why cohesion is so important, using his dog as a metaphor, you must win the respect and love of your crew so THEY choose YOU. The crew decide to work as a cohesive unit, working together to save Quade. It is the first time that the Captain can be seen actually working with the team, and not just giving them orders. They enter onto the planet's surface together, working as a team to save their comrade. It is only through cohesion that they overcome the transphasia, and save Quade. This is why cohesion is so significant in this story. "

        "Query": "What is the plot of END AS A HERO, and how does Peter Granthan use his knowledge of the Gool's mind control to save himself and others?",
        "Article": "Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,\nstifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the\nobscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy\nof xenophobia\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\n  \n \n  I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.\nNot pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,\ntracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\n  \n \n  I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There\nwas a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner\nsource, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its\nrim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a\nmore favorable position.\n  \n \n \n \n  I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that\nlinked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced\nthe passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where\nsmaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory\ntold me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that\nwould transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had\ndiscovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur\nalone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\u2014riches\nbeyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe\ncluster\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\u2014at a single feeding\ntrough. They would spread out across a galaxy\u2014and beyond.\n  \n \n  But not if I could help it.\n  \n \n  The Gool had evolved a plan\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\n  \n \n  In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among\nthe fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,\nperhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a\nman back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\n  \n \n  Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter\nof the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a\npsychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened\nthe fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see\nwhat I could steal.\n  \n \n  A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and\nwhite sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,\nfared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the\nconcepts of an alien mind.\n  \n \n  I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within\npattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\n  \n \n  I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its\nmeaning exploded in my mind.\n  \n \n  From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in\nits lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of\ntheir kind.\n  \n \n  Matter across space.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You've got to listen to me, Kayle,\" I shouted. \"I know you think I'm\na Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without\na fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The\nconcept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take\nmy word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus\nan infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\u2014and a few other\nthings....\"\n  \n \n  I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was\ngetting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\nscreens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\n  \n \n  Kayle came back\u2014and his answer boiled down to \"no.\"\n  \n \n  I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\nfor the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\ncross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\nto the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\ntalked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\nego-complex.\n  \n \n  I might have saved my breath.\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped.\n\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\nyou well enough. I'm sorry.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\nthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\nproblem at hand.\n  \n \n  I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\nreference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\nstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\nthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\ndaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\n  \n \n  And I had a few ideas.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\nwild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\nit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\npreparatory to picking up approach orbit....\"\n  \n \n  The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\nautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\nwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\nme\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\nmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\nstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\nkeys, spoke into his microphone:\n  \n \n  \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\nseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\nbelated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\nnow, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am\npicking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  There was a long pause. Then:\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\ncountermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\nninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\nof defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\ndumb, and hope for a little luck.\n  \n \n  \"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\nfellows. I'm a little banged up\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.\nWhat was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I\nchecked in with DEW\u2014\"\n  \n \n  It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the\ncontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014\n  \n \n  A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\nfrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\nscreens blanked off....\n  \n \n  For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\nattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\nsoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\nover, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\n  \n \n  I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\ndisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\nlifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\nthe water.\n  \n \n  I would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\nposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I was\nbadly in need of a pick-up.

I saw dark sea, the\nglint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on\nthe horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the\npilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next\nattacker.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling\nwalk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.\n   \n   A few more\nminutes and you can lie down ... rest....\n   \n \n \n  The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker\nsquare. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside\nfor a grip with my good hand.\n  \n \n  Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped\nalong the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.\nI ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a\nconfused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the\ncity all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep\u2014\n  \n \n  I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a\ngout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between\nthe cars. I caught the clear thought:\n  \n \n  \"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right\u2014\"\n  \n \n  I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went\nout, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled\nsteer.\n  \n \n  It was easy\u2014if I could only stay awake.\n  \n \n  I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark\ncorner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality\nfraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn\nme of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide\ndown into darkness.\n  \n<doc-sep>I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\nreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up\na hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a\nfracture. The left arm\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to the\nshoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar\ntissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the\ntruss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at\nleisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't\ncomplaining.\n  \n \n  As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the\nGool\u2014if I survived.\n  \n \n  I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the\ncondition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was\ndogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at\nwork.\n  \n \n  I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\u2014with\na broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014I\nshouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\nfrom\n   \n   Belshazzar's\n   \n  CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\nport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\nrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\nand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\nhere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\n  \n \n  I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\nIt was almost five minutes before the \"acknowledge\" came through from\nthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\nswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\nhaggard look.\n  \n \n  \"Granthan!\" he burst out. \"Where are the others? What happened out\nthere?\" I turned him down to a mutter.\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" I said. \"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\" I didn't wait for\nan answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Belshazzar\n   \n  was sabotaged. So was\n   \n   Gilgamesh\n   \n  \u2014I think. I got out. I\nlost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\nMed people the drinks are on me.\"\n  \n \n  I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\nscreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\nas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\nget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.\nKayle was talking.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\nthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\"\n  \n \n  \"How the hell do I know?\" I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\ndroning on:\n  \n \n  \"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\nhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\npossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\ntold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to on\nthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\n  \n \n  \"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\nwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\npossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\nknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\npass the patrol line.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\nthe risk.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do I do now?\" I stormed. \"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\nyou think of something? I need a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  Presently Kayle replied. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You'll have to enter a\nparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\nit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\" He didn't meet my\neye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\nknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\nwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\npretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'd\nbeen condemned to death.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\nwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\nconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\nrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\nmy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\nwas acting under Gool orders.\n  \n \n  I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\npsychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\nearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\nmine, all mine....\n  \n \n  But how could I be sure of that?\n  \n \n  Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\nskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\ntheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\nlike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\nwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\nmind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\n  \n \n  Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\nresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see again\nwhat had happened.\n  \n \n  I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\nthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\n  \n \n  Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\nfirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\nsurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\ntheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\nthrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\nmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention.

        "Summary_1": "Peter Granthan, a psychodynamicist, wakes up severely injured on a lifeboat after his spaceship \"Belshazzar\" has been mysteriously destroyed. He has no recollection of what has happened to him. He thinks to himself he must have been the first ever survivor to come into contact with a \"Gool\", a fierce alien race who infiltrate and control people's minds. He makes a call to TSA headquarters back on Earth, who control the mission from the ground. On the other end is Ausar Kayle. Kayle asks Granthan what happened to the rest of the crew. Granthan relays how he got out. Kayle thinks that Granthan may be under the control of the Gool, and he may be the one who inadvertently caused the destruction of the ship. Kayle orders Granthan to stay in Orbit around Earth. Granthan knows that if he stays in orbit, there is sure to be a fleet of missiles on their way towards him. He decides to enter his own mind, in search of a Gool spy that may be tampering with it. He dives deep into his sub conscious. He looks into his memory, where he finds a Gool. He sees how it controlled him as he unknowingly made his way onto the lifeboat, escaping the burning ship. \nHe follows the Gool, studying how it infiltrates minds and controls them as it goes. He reaches out to the Gool, infiltrating it's mind. Granthan takes control of the Gool's mind, inside of his own. He see's the Gool's home world. In it he finds the secret to Matter across space. \nHe calls Kayle, explaining the information he has just found. Kayle doesn't believe Granthan, still thinking he is being controlled by the Gool. Granthan plans his course of re-entry. Now knowing the secret to the Gool's mind control, he uses the technique to convince various stations on Earth to allow him to land, and not raise suspicion. He eventually lands in the ocean, some distance outside Key West. \nKayle realises Granthan has landed, and he readies the missiles. Granthan finds the man's mind who controls the missiles, enters it, and forces him to hit the self destruct button. He infiltrates a fisherman's mind, convincing him to take him to shore, while bombs are being dropped around them. He then gets a driver to take him to a rail yard.  \nWhen he arrives at a train yard, he lays down to rest in the empty box car where he just fought a guard. While the train is stopped, he convinces a man to buy him food and water. \nThe train is headed for New Orleans, and his plan is to raid the Delta National Labs. He arrives before dawn, and crawls out of the car.He gets a man to drive him into town, where he buys new clothes and hails a cab, who takes him to the Laboratories. They arrive, Granthan gets out of the car. The taxi driver drives away. ",
        "Summary_2": "Granthan is a psychodynamicist on a mission to end Earth's war with the Gool, a species tribe with the goal to spread an empire throughout the galaxy through tactics of mind control. Granthan awakes on a lifeboat, in immense pain and terrible condition. He presumably came in contact with the Gool and ended up alive, though scathed. However, he has no recollection of what happened or how he managed to escape on the lifeboat. Granthan decides to call TSA headquarters, informing Col. Kayle that he is alive. Kayle is skeptical, aware of the Gool's ability to mind control, and believes that Granthan has been brainwashed due to his inability to recall the events. Kayle decides that he cannot risk a potentially sabotaged Granthan returning to Earth, and Granthan realizes that he is going to be executed. Urgently in need of a solution, Granthan remembers his training before the mission, how he had learned how to access his subconscious to obtain memories. He decides to do so, going back and seeing his mind being probed by the Gool and controlling his actions. Upon seeing how the Gool had taken control of his mind, Granthan realizes that he, too, can replicate the practice, and he probes the mind of a Gool. When he probes the Gool, he finds that they plan to take over the galaxy through matter transmission. Granthan calls Kayle again, explaining what he has seen and begging for him to change his mind. However, Kayle still refuses to let Granthan return. Granthan then decides to take matters into his own hands, using his mind control techniques to make officers allow him through and shut off radar detection. As Granthan lands on the ocean's surface, he calls Kayle again in an effort to convince him. Instead, Kayle tells him it's too late, and General Titus appears through transmission to salute him before his execution. At the last second, though, Granthan uses his mind control on the man controlling the missiles, and detonates them, buying him time to take the escape capsule to shore. Granthan eventually ends up at a trainyard, fending off an attacker before sneaking onto a train car. As the train stops near a store, he overtakes the train conductor and walks in, buying food and water for himself. At dawn, he exits the train car and gets a lift from a driver on the road, asking him to take him to Delta National Laboratories. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Granthan is a psychodynamics who was assigned by Colonel Ausar Kayle, an Aerospace Intelligence officer, to go on the Belshazzar to investigate the possibility of hyper-cortical invasion. According to Granthan, they\u2019ve found the Gool, but something has happened to them that the Belshazzar was sabotaged and only Granthan survives this devastation. And the story begins with Granthan in some kind of dream where he is badly burned and really hurt, except, this was not simply a dream. He wakes up realizing that his right leg is broken, his skull is probably fractured, and his left arm was badly burned. Surprisingly, those injuries have been taken care of. There is a walking brace on his leg, stiches on his head, arm is wrapped to the shoulder; to add onto that, he somehow got himself onto a lifeboat. Granthan has no idea how he might be capable of doing any of those given his conditions. \n\nHe quickly contacted Kayle and told him about the disaster, but Kayle is suspicious of the reasons that he is the only survivor. The Gool is known to have telehypnotic abilities that can control men without them being aware of it, thus Granthan\u2019s blackout during the attack seems to be fitting. Kayle refuses to land Granthan on Earth. Granthan decides to figure out what actually happened to him during the blackout. Since he is a psychodynamicist, he can gather the memories of his subconscious and see what has occurred. Going multiple levels deeper within the memory, he finally finds the Gool. He watches the Gool take over his body and his mind, he sees how the Gool managed to get him onto the lifeboat, and he sees how the Gool is able to withdraw from the mind, leaving no marks behind. Then, he learns the way that the Gool controls the mind, which allows him to acknowledge the plan that the Gool has \u2013 to spread out across the galaxy and beyond. Finally, he learns their secret, matter transmission.\n\nAfter grasping the idea of sending matter across space, Granthan tells Kayle that he can build it. Kayle rejects the idea despite Granthan\u2019s effort to explain his training on encephaloscope. Granthan then uses the Gool\u2019s ability that he has just gained to pass the outer defense line, to disappear off the radar, and to avoid the missiles, etc. He is able to get to a train for some sleep, and later he gets off near the New Orleans, where he changed his clothes and goes to Delta National Laboratories. With the ability to control people\u2019s mind, Granthan seems to be able to do things as he wish. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Granthan waking up on a couch. He recognizes his left arm is heavily injured and the rest of his body is not faring much better either. He ponders whether he is the first survivor of contacting the Gool and even more if he is even alive. He musters his strength to get a call to TSA headquarters where Ausar Kayle answers the emergency call. Kayle accuses Granthan of being mind-controlled by the Gool and Granthan excitedly states that he is not. Nevertheless, Kayle instructs Granthan to go to a waiting post in orbit. Granthan knows that he is to do this so he can be killed. He does not want to go through with that and so he thinks about alternatives to help himself.\n\nGranthan begins to use his training to try to deduce whether he is being controlled by the Gool. He breaks through a hallucinatory third level during this process of discovery. Granthan is seemingly able to successfully enter a Gool\u2019s mind. In the process, he learns more about how they live, where their young reside, and their goals. Granthan believes that he was able to successfully spy on the Gool and that he can safely return to Earth to relay what he has learned. He believes that their ultimate secret is matter across space. Granthan tells Kayle what he has learned and is dismayed that Kayle still refuses to allow him to return to Earth. Kayle is still not convinced and doesn\u2019t trust him. \n\nGranthan decides to use his newfound mind-control technique to get back to Earth by getting his ship cleared to return by an unwitting officer. He heads towards Earth. He lands on the water and contacts Kayle again to convince him. Kayle still does not relent. Granthan continues to insist that he is not a spy, but Kayle does not budge. Granthan begins to use mind control to his advantage to keep himself safe while back on Earth. He is still heavily injured and has trouble keeping himself awake. It is evident that he is learning how to better use the mind control capabilities through his practice on others. Eventually, Granthan ends up at Delta National Laboratories after convincing a cab driver to take him there. \n"

I\ntalked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\nego-complex.\n  \n \n  I might have saved my breath.\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped.\n\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\nyou well enough. I'm sorry.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\nthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\nproblem at hand.\n  \n \n  I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\nreference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\nstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\nthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\ndaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\n  \n \n  And I had a few ideas.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\nwild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\nit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\npreparatory to picking up approach orbit....\"\n  \n \n  The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\nautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\nwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\nme\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\nmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\nstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\nkeys, spoke into his microphone:\n  \n \n  \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\nseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\nbelated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\nnow, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am\npicking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  There was a long pause. Then:\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\ncountermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\nninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\nof defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\ndumb, and hope for a little luck.\n  \n \n  \"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\nfellows. I'm a little banged up\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.\nWhat was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I\nchecked in with DEW\u2014\"\n  \n \n  It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the\ncontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014\n  \n \n  A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\nfrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\nscreens blanked off....\n  \n \n  For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\nattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\nsoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\nover, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\n  \n \n  I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\ndisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\nlifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\nthe water.\n  \n \n  I would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\nposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I was\nbadly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\n  \n \n  \"This is Z four-oh-two,\" I said. \"I have an urgent report for Colonel\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\"\n  \n \n  Kayle's face appeared. \"Don't fight it, Granthan,\" he croaked. \"You\npenetrated the planetary defenses\u2014God knows how. I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Later,\" I snapped. \"How about calling off your dogs now? And send\nsomebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other\ncomplaints.\"\n  \n \n  \"We have you pinpointed,\" Kayle cut in. \"It's no use fighting it,\nGranthan.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\nreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up\na hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a\nfracture. The left arm\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to the\nshoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar\ntissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the\ntruss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at\nleisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't\ncomplaining.\n  \n \n  As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the\nGool\u2014if I survived.\n  \n \n  I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the\ncondition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was\ndogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at\nwork.\n  \n \n  I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\u2014with\na broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014I\nshouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\nfrom\n   \n   Belshazzar's\n   \n  CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\nport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\nrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\nand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\nhere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\n  \n \n  I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\nIt was almost five minutes before the \"acknowledge\" came through from\nthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\nswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\nhaggard look.\n  \n \n  \"Granthan!\" he burst out. \"Where are the others? What happened out\nthere?\" I turned him down to a mutter.\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" I said. \"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\" I didn't wait for\nan answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Belshazzar\n   \n  was sabotaged. So was\n   \n   Gilgamesh\n   \n  \u2014I think. I got out. I\nlost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\nMed people the drinks are on me.\"\n  \n \n  I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\nscreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\nas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\nget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.\nKayle was talking.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\nthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\"\n  \n \n  \"How the hell do I know?\" I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\ndroning on:\n  \n \n  \"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\nhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\npossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\ntold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to on\nthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\n  \n \n  \"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\nwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\npossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\nknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\npass the patrol line.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\nthe risk.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do I do now?\" I stormed. \"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\nyou think of something? I need a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  Presently Kayle replied. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You'll have to enter a\nparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\nit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\" He didn't meet my\neye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\nknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\nwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\npretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'd\nbeen condemned to death.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\nwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\nconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\nrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\nmy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\nwas acting under Gool orders.\n  \n \n  I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\npsychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\nearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\nmine, all mine....\n  \n \n  But how could I be sure of that?\n  \n \n  Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\nskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\ntheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\nlike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\nwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\nmind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\n  \n \n  Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\nresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see again\nwhat had happened.\n  \n \n  I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\nthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\n  \n \n  Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\nfirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\nsurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\ntheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\nthrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\nmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

And then I was awake\u2014and the fire was still there, fiercely\nburning at me.\n  \n \n  I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain\nhit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the\nriver of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and\nconscious.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to\nan unpadded acceleration couch\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm\ninstalls in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but\nno one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a\nlot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.\nI took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,\nbut the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the\ncracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\n  \n \n  There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I\ntried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation\nthat transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with\nthe charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek\nup Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the\nmicroswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was\nfading out again....\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Kayle does not allow Granthan to re-enter Earth because he has a suspicion that Granthan might be under the control of the Gool. When Grantahn escaped the burning Belshazzar, he blacked out. He has no recollection of the incident. Granthan can also offer no explanation to Kayle as to why the ship was destroyed, or what happened to the rest of his crew. It is mysterious that Granthan was able to escape, especially while being so badly injured. Kayle believes that the Gool might have been the one to infiltrate Granthan's mind, and sabotage the mission, saving Granthan's life so he could return as a host to Earth. This would then allow the Gool to have a spy on Earth during the ongoing war. Even when Granthan tries to explain to Kayle that he has broken into a Gool's mind, and found data that would win them the war, Kayle is not convinced. He believes that the Gool will try anything to allow it's host to land. Kayle readies the missiles in the direction of Granthan's ship. While it is obvious that Kayle likes Granthan, and feels deep sympathy for him, he cannot take the risk of letting a Gool onto planet Earth. Even when Granthan manages to get past initial security on his descent, Kayle orders Granthan to stop. When Granthan lands on Earth, Kayle sends missiles to his location to take him out. Kayle can't let Granthan free on planet Earth, the risk would be too big in the war between mankind and the Gools. ",
        "Summary_2": "Kayle does not allow Granathan to re-enter Earth because he sees it as too much of a risk. He knows that Granthan came in contact with the Gool on his mission, and he is aware that the Gool have mind-controlling and hypnotic powers; when Granthan calls Kayle but is unable to remember the events that occurred, Kayle is sure that he has fallen victim to the Gool's tactics. If Granthan was potentially brainwashed or being controlled, he could risk sabotaging Earth from the inside, so Kayle decides that it is not worth the danger.",
        "Summary_3": "Kayle learns that the Gool may have the ability to somehow telehypnotically control a man\u2019s mind without the man knowing it. And Granthan has told Kayle that he has experienced a period of blackout during the disaster, including not knowing how he ended up on the lifeboat. Moreover, since Granthan is the only one that is left alive after coming in contact with the Gool; no one has survived before. Thus, Kayle assumes that there is a risk of the Gool using the telehypnotical ability on Granthan, which means that Gool can still be in control of Granthan, as well as control him even if he is back on Earth. Since they are at war with the Gool, it seems reasonable, from what he knows, for Kayle to refuse Granthan to re-enter Earth. \n\nWhen Granthan tries to explain matter transmission to Kayle, Kayle states that he does not understand the jargons that he is using, and refuses him again. After Granthan breaks through the planetary defenses, he got in contact with Kayle again. Kayle says that it is too late even if he do want to believe him. ",
        "Summary_4": "Kayle believes that Granthan is being mind-controlled by the Gool and does not want to risk him returning to Earth and decimating them. He cannot trust that Granthan is acting of his own volition and would rather be safe. The Gool are known to use telehypontic abilities to control others without them knowing. Kayle does not want to risk Earth being experiencing hyper-cortical invasion, which would be a possibility if Granthan returned to Earth and was in fact being controlled. Based on the risk, Kayle orders Granthan not to return to Earth. "

But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without\na fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The\nconcept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take\nmy word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus\nan infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil\u2014and a few other\nthings....\"\n  \n \n  I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was\ngetting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\nscreens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\n  \n \n  Kayle came back\u2014and his answer boiled down to \"no.\"\n  \n \n  I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\nfor the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\ncross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\nto the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\ntalked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\nego-complex.\n  \n \n  I might have saved my breath.\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped.\n\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\nyou well enough. I'm sorry.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\nthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\nproblem at hand.\n  \n \n  I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\nreference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\nstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\nthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\ndaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\n  \n \n  And I had a few ideas.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\nwild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\nit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\npreparatory to picking up approach orbit....\"\n  \n \n  The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\nautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\nwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\nme\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\nmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\nstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\nkeys, spoke into his microphone:\n  \n \n  \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\nseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\nbelated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\nnow, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am\npicking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  There was a long pause. Then:\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\ncountermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\nninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\nof defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\ndumb, and hope for a little luck.\n  \n \n  \"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\nfellows. I'm a little banged up\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.\nWhat was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I\nchecked in with DEW\u2014\"\n  \n \n  It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the\ncontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014\n  \n \n  A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\nfrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\nscreens blanked off....\n  \n \n  For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\nattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\nsoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\nover, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\n  \n \n  I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\ndisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\nlifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\nthe water.\n  \n \n  I would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\nposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I was\nbadly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\n  \n \n  \"This is Z four-oh-two,\" I said. \"I have an urgent report for Colonel\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\"\n  \n \n  Kayle's face appeared. \"Don't fight it, Granthan,\" he croaked. \"You\npenetrated the planetary defenses\u2014God knows how. I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Later,\" I snapped. \"How about calling off your dogs now? And send\nsomebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other\ncomplaints.\"\n  \n \n  \"We have you pinpointed,\" Kayle cut in. \"It's no use fighting it,\nGranthan.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,\nstifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the\nobscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy\nof xenophobia\u2014a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\n  \n \n  I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.\nNot pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,\ntracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\n  \n \n  I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There\nwas a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner\nsource, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its\nrim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a\nmore favorable position.\n  \n \n \n \n  I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that\nlinked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced\nthe passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where\nsmaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory\ntold me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that\nwould transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had\ndiscovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur\nalone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals\u2014riches\nbeyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe\ncluster\u2014those who remained of a once-great race\u2014at a single feeding\ntrough. They would spread out across a galaxy\u2014and beyond.\n  \n \n  But not if I could help it.\n  \n \n  The Gool had evolved a plan\u2014but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\n  \n \n  In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among\nthe fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,\nperhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a\nman back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\n  \n \n  Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter\nof the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a\npsychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened\nthe fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see\nwhat I could steal.\n  \n \n  A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and\nwhite sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,\nfared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the\nconcepts of an alien mind.\n  \n \n  I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within\npattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\n  \n \n  I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its\nmeaning exploded in my mind.\n  \n \n  From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in\nits lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of\ntheir kind.\n  \n \n  Matter across space.\n  \n<doc-sep>I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but\nreasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up\na hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a\nfracture. The left arm\u2014well, it was still there, wrapped to the\nshoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar\ntissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the\ntruss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at\nleisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't\ncomplaining.\n  \n \n  As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the\nGool\u2014if I survived.\n  \n \n  I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the\ncondition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was\ndogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at\nwork.\n  \n \n  I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition\u2014with\na broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull\u2014I\nshouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip\nfrom\n   \n   Belshazzar's\n   \n  CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that\nport shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But\nrunning on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers\nand thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was\nhere\u2014and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\n  \n \n  I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.\nIt was almost five minutes before the \"acknowledge\" came through from\nthe Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face\nswam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the\nhaggard look.\n  \n \n  \"Granthan!\" he burst out. \"Where are the others? What happened out\nthere?\" I turned him down to a mutter.\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" I said. \"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\" I didn't wait for\nan answer\u2014not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Belshazzar\n   \n  was sabotaged. So was\n   \n   Gilgamesh\n   \n  \u2014I think. I got out. I\nlost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the\nMed people the drinks are on me.\"\n  \n \n  I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the\nscreen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile\nas a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would\nget his reaction to my report. I dozed off\u2014and awoke with a start.\nKayle was talking.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in\nthe disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\"\n  \n \n  \"How the hell do I know?\" I yelled\u2014or croaked. But Kayle's voice was\ndroning on:\n  \n \n  \"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may\nhave some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it\npossible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've\ntold me yourself that you blacked out during the attack\u2014and came to on\nthe lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\n  \n \n  \"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without\nwarning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the\npossibility of\u2014what's that term you use?\u2014hyper-cortical invasion. You\nknow better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to\npass the patrol line.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept\nthe risk.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do I do now?\" I stormed. \"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope\nyou think of something? I need a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  Presently Kayle replied. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You'll have to enter a\nparking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make\nit possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\" He didn't meet my\neye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of\nknowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing\nwhat he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and\npretend\u2014right up until the warheads struck\u2014that I didn't know I'd\nbeen condemned to death.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I\nwas alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a\nconverging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery\nrange of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive\nmy next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I\nwas acting under Gool orders.\n  \n \n  I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,\npsychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks\nearlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were\nmine, all mine....\n  \n \n  But how could I be sure of that?\n  \n \n  Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as\nskillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of\ntheir tampering\u2014not at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting\nlike any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I\nwasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the\nmind\u2014and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\n  \n \n  Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one\nresource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious\u2014and see again\nwhat had happened.\n  \n \n  I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on\nthe trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\n  \n \n  Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a\nfirst-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty\nsurface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in\ntheir limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke\nthrough into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of\nmirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\n  \n<doc-sep>The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\nme. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\npersonality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\ncontinuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\n  \n \n  And found it.\n  \n \n  As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\nof static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\nprobing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\nmotivations.\n  \n \n  I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   It is a contact, Effulgent One!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the\nthreshold....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating\ntrough!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the\nvoices\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\nintricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\nconcretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\nagainst the intruding stimuli\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\nof the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\ncenters, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\ncontrol compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\nthe way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\u2014and then the\nhatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\nMy blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\nthe lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\u2014and the\nworld-ending impact as I fell.\n  \n \n  At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\nlashed out again\u2014fighting the invader.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend\nthe last filament of your life-force!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\nare instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\nfollowed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\nmy subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\npassage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\u2014at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\n  \n \n  The insinuating probe\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\ntheorized\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\n  \n \n  But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\nbeen done to me.\n  \n \n  Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\nand manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\ncrystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\nthemselves.\n  \n \n  Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\nto pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\nvoid\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\nglistening dark shape.\n  \n \n  There was a soundless shriek. \"\n   \n   Effulgence! It reached out\u2014touched\nme!\n   \n  \"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

And then I was awake\u2014and the fire was still there, fiercely\nburning at me.\n  \n \n  I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain\nhit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the\nriver of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and\nconscious.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to\nan unpadded acceleration couch\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm\ninstalls in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but\nno one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a\nlot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.\nI took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,\nbut the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the\ncracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\n  \n \n  There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I\ntried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation\nthat transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with\nthe charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek\nup Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the\nmicroswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was\nfading out again....\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "While searching his mind, Granthan finds a Gool, using this technique on him. He watches as the Gool traces out the pattern in his subconscious, studies and remembers it. He uses this new found skill to infiltrate the Gool's mind. In it he sees the Gool's home world, along with the rest of its colony, and a piece of theory that could win the war for Earth. When Granthan returns to the physical world to share the good news with Kayle, he is dismissed, and sentenced to death. Granthan flies onto Earth, reaches out with his mind, finding a Signal Officer. He convinces the officer to let him pass. He then infiltrates the mind of a radar man, forcing him to switch off the radar screens. When Kayle decides to send a fleet of missiles to Granthan's location in the pacific, Granthan reaches out with his mind, finds two men working in the control centre, and forces them to hit the self-destruct button on the bombs, saving his life. To escape his life boat, Granthan coerces a fisherman into taking him onboard, where they narrowly miss bombs being dropped on them. He then forces a driver to take him into town, convincing him that he was going to buy groceries. Granthan arrives at the train yard and uses his new power to defeat a guard who recognises Granthan, with a gun cocked towards him. While the train is stopped, he orders a man to buy him food, water and cigarettes, which the man delivers to him. When his train arrives in New Orleans, he forces a driver to take him into town, quickly diminishing his curiosity. When the cab driver arrives at the laboratories, Granthan finally convinces the man to drive around the field, leading to an open gate, where Granthan exits the car. ",
        "Summary_2": "Granthan initially tries to use his psychodynamic abilities to go back into his subconscious and find hidden memories of his interaction with the Gool. While in his subconscious, he is able to witness how the Gool probed his mind to control it. By seeing the techniques used by the Gool, Granthan is able to replicate it using his knowledge of psychodynamics, and through this, he probes the mind of the Gool and realizes that he has mastered the practice. Granthan uses this new ability to his advantage, particularly by mind controlling the officers that are ordered to prevent him from entering Earth and execute him. He also uses the ability through his escape route, controlling drivers, train conductors, and other passerby to help advance himself.",
        "Summary_3": "Granthan learns about the mind control techniques by going deeper into his subconscious mind and seeing the Gool withdrawing from him without his consciousness being aware of it. He realizes that he can do the same thing as the Gool. Then he decides to use the mind control to his own advantage by mind controlling people so that he can do things as he wish. \n\nFirstly, Granthan was able to use what he learned to spy on the Gool and learn about matter transmission. Later, he uses the mind control abilities during his escape. He first tries to control the Signal Officer to allow him to pass the outer line of defense. Then, he mind controls the radar man to make his radar disappear so that his location will not be exposed; he controls the  control center man, and he destroys one of the missiles; he prevents many attackers from attacking him while inside the capsule. Later on the train, he controls a man for food. Through practice, Granthan also discovers that the person being controlled can behave rationally once an impulse to act is given; there is no need for complete control over the person. At New Orleans, he controls a taxi driver to take him to the gate of Delta National Laboratories and makes him forget that he ever saw Granthan. ",
        "Summary_4": "Granthan learns how to use the Gool\u2019s mind control technique by watching them and utilizing their own methods. He has previous experience with psychodynamics that helps inform him on how to do so. He notices their patterns and tries to duplicate them. He essentially copies their techniques of probing into tiny planes of existence to reach a black pit where the Gool seem to exist. He does so seemingly successfully and is able to locate and control a Gool\u2019s mind, according to his own analysis. He uses it to learn more about Gool\u2019s and how they live. \n\nGranthan begins to use the mind control technique to allow people to do his bidding for him. He is able to reenter Earth by controlling an officer to grant him entry. He detonates the missiles that are launched to kill him through the same methods. He prevents himself from being attacked or potentially caught while at the train yard by again using mind control. He saves the life of himself and the fisherman helping him by destroying a cruiser\u2019s gunnery crew. He is able to get food for himself by mind-controlling a man to go and buy him goods at a store. He is able to hitch a ride on a truck by influencing the driver. \n"

        "Summary_1": "The setting of this story changes as the plot develops. When we first meet Peter Granthan, he is onboard a lifeboat, which is fleeing the now destroyed starship \"Belshazzar\". He travels within range of planet Earth, where, onboard the lifeboat, he dives into his mind. He enters the setting of his subconscious, which is stark and expansive. Granthan travels through the Gool's mind to its home world. It is described as being filled with yellow seas, reaching out to \"endless shores of mud\". There are great pits, rising with steam, in which the gools feed. Each cable underground connects to a massive brain, which controls the species. After Granthan's trip to the Alien planet, he lands on Earth, in the Pacific ocean, just outside of Key West. He then moves onto a train yard, where he boards a train. The train stops in a rural area, where, using a host, Granthan goes into a local shop to buy food. He travels to New  Orleans, where he arrives the next day. The area is swampy. He forces a driver to take him to a shappy, run down corner of the city, where he goes into a second hand clothes shop. Granthan then makes his way to the Delta National Laboratories, surrounded by a large field. He moves around the field in his taxi, before arriving at open gates to the Labs. ",
        "Summary_2": "The first part of the story takes place on Granthan's lifeboat, which contains a first aid cabinet, a couch, and an escape capsule with an energy plant. At the beginning of the story, Granthan is in space, on his way to Earth. He then ends up in the ocean, near Key West, where he leads his escape capsule to shore. Through the rest of the story, Granthan travels through many different settings, including a fishing camp, a trainyard, and a train car, before ending up at a clothing store and being driven to Delta National Laboratories. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in a seldom-used lifeboat where there are three couches in the room. There is a screen that allows connection from the Ganymede relay station to be seen in a fifteen-minute transmission lag. Then after Granthan \u00ac\u00ac\u00acgoes into the Gool itself where there are yellow seas with shores of mud, and there is also a fuming pit. He sees the cables of nervous tissue as well as young Gool. Later after Granthan breaks through the barrier, he gets to a trainyard. At the trainyard, there was some tracks that Granthan walks along, he finally gets into a car and walks up later finding a bar across from where he is. There is a linoleum-topped counter behind the door. Finally, Granthan arrives near New Orleans where he gets into a taxi and goes to the Delta National Laboratories after changing his cloths at the marketing district of the city.",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Granthan on a couch in an unremarkable room. He is on a lifeboat in space, but still within the same solar system as the Earth. There are transmissions that are sent between Earth and where Granthan is located in space and they take about 15 minutes one way to arrive at either designation. Part of the story takes place in a Gool\u2019s mind where Granthan is exploring through it to understand them. When Granthan returns back to Earth he lands on the water near Key West in Florida. While on Earth, Granthan goes from the ocean to a train yard and to a fisherman\u2019s boat. The story ends with a cab driver dropping Granthan off at Delta National Laboratories, not too far from New Orleans. "

If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my\nscreens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\n  \n \n  Kayle came back\u2014and his answer boiled down to \"no.\"\n  \n \n  I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself\nfor the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the\ncross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits\nto the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I\ntalked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the\nego-complex.\n  \n \n  I might have saved my breath.\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped.\n\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to\nyou well enough. I'm sorry.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind\nthoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the\nproblem at hand.\n  \n \n  I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the\nreference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor\nstations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat\nthe size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a\ndaring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\n  \n \n  And I had a few ideas.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a\nwild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized\nit was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee\npreparatory to picking up approach orbit....\"\n  \n \n  The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the\nautopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout\nwas moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes, reached out\u2014as the Gool mind had reached out to\nme\u2014and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand\nmiles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of\nstruggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched\nkeys, spoke into his microphone:\n  \n \n  \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen\nseconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his\nbelated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line\nnow, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am\npicking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"\n  \n \n  There was a long pause. Then:\n  \n \n  \"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance\ncountermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code\nninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line\nof defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it\ndumb, and hope for a little luck.\n  \n \n  \"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,\nfellows. I'm a little banged up\u2014I guess I switched frequencies on you.\nWhat was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I\nchecked in with DEW\u2014\"\n  \n \n  It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the\ncontrols, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out\u2014\n  \n \n  A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose\nfrom his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar\nscreens blanked off....\n  \n \n  For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after\nattack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles\nsoutheast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,\nover, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\n  \n \n  I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy\ndisorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking\nlifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on\nthe water.\n  \n \n  I would have to risk calling Kayle now\u2014but by voluntarily giving my\nposition away, I should convince him I was still on our side\u2014and I was\nbadly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\n  \n \n  \"This is Z four-oh-two,\" I said. \"I have an urgent report for Colonel\nKayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\"\n  \n \n  Kayle's face appeared. \"Don't fight it, Granthan,\" he croaked. \"You\npenetrated the planetary defenses\u2014God knows how.

        "Summary_1": "The Gool are an evil Alien race, at war with planet Earth. They are a hive mind. Each being is an extension of a greater conscience. This conscience is hidden deep in their home world, a brain that connects to both the planet and its people. They are described as \"organs\u201d to it. They can telepathically communicate with their leader through soundless thought. They have the ability to infiltrate the minds of their enemies, taking control over them and using them as hosts. This allows the species to sabotage missions, and create spies behind enemy lines. Their numbers have dwindled and what was once a great race, is now a mere colony. But they have plans to expand to newly discovered worlds, where they would replenish their numbers, and be mighty once again. They feed on minerals and metals. They could usually only take over certain minds, but never before like Granthan's. His mind was clear, out of the way of all the others, which made it easy for them to get their claws into him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Gool were previously a great and prominent race in space, now a tribe interested in spreading out and overtaking the galaxy and planting themselves in places where they would have an abundance of food, such as potassium, calcium, and iron. They plan to achieve this using their special mind-control techniques. The Gool are able to probe the minds of individuals, gathering information but also gaining the ability to control their movements and actions; they are also able to erase parts of memory from an individual.",
        "Summary_3": "According to Kayle, the Gool are in war with the men. At first, the Gool was assumed to have the ability to somehow telehypnotically control a man\u2019s mind without the man knowing it. By going into his subconscious mind, Granthan learns that the Gool can engrave their demands onto the subconscious minds of a man. In the past, the Gool has been controlling men at the superficial level. Digging deeper into his subconscious mind, Granthan learns that the Gool are building fleets that transport the spawn to a world where food was for free. And they want to spread out across the galaxy, thus they\u2019ve came up with a plan. Further exploring, Granthan finds out that they have the ability for matter transmission across space. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Gool\u2019s are a group of people that use hyper-cortical invasion to subvert the will of previously loyal people to enact their own wants and desires. They have built fleets of ships meant to transport their young to new worlds that they have discovered. The new worlds were desirable because they had plenty of food that could be acquired from them.

He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. \"They'll have the\nhighway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got\nonto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"The old Ranch Road? Good Lord\u2014it's completely closed. Nobody's\nsupposed to drive over it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\" Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. \"That's our best\nchance. Now call down the twins and let's get going.

Miss Parker says if we don't get this done\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You can forget about fractions.\" Ed grabbed his son as he came down the\nstairs and propelled him toward the door. \"Where's Jim?\"\n  \n \n  \"He's coming.\"\n  \n \n  Jim started slowly down the stairs. \"What's up, Dad?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're going for a ride.\"\n  \n \n  \"A ride?

And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out.\nSickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of\nmotion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy.\nIt was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse\u2014the thing hurtling at him,\ncold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow\nT-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange\nhalf-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?\n  \n \n  A stinger.\n  \n \n  Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce\nrolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as\nstatues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again.\nThis time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It\nbounced against the wall and fluttered down.\n  \n \n  Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien\nmind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his\nown, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien presence,\nsettling over him\u2014and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a\nbroken heap on the rug.\n  \n \n  It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of\nsome kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy.... He closed his mind\ntight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his\nknife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still,\nneither of them moving.\n  \n \n  The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It\nwas ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and\nopen fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone.\n  \n \n  Loyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and\nson. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps.\n  \n \n  A moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness\ntoward the edge of town.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

After all, no really effective test\nwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n  \n \n  The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran\nLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education.

There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive\nsociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru\nshould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy\nof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran\nprimitive tradition of romance.\n  \n \n  \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were\nout of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me!

At the same time he was regretting being grounded and on bad terms with I.S.P. for a mistake. Suddenly, he felt danger and when the Mercurial dancer approached him, a Martian attempted an attack. After a short fight, Dennis overcame the Martian who turned out to possess a prohibited weapon and supposedly was a space pirate. After capturing the pirate, Dennis was called by I.S.P. commander and told that Marla and her whole spaceship traveling to Terra disappeared, supposedly captured by Koerber, the head of pirates. Dennis begged to be sent for the pirate leader and the commander gave him this chance. They watched a recording of Marla's spaceship zig-zagging and being attacked, which ended with a blank screen. Dennis immediately set out to space on a cruiser. After a long search without success, something appeared on the visa-screen and the crew prepared to board. Nevertheless, no survivors were found and the Captain, Dennis, was out of hope. Everyone left in silence the spot of the tragedy of the attacked spacer. Back on the ship, one of the crew, George Randall, gladly informed that an object was detected. The crew rushed for the object which indeed turned out to be a pirate craft trying to escape the persecutor. Koerber's ship was soon doomed and he caught Dennis' ship with a beam to follow. The ship crashed and the crew found itself in a place without any chance to escape from. The captain ordered to explore the place and see what happened to Koerber for sure, while others will be welding, and the crew reentered the ship.",

He was distracted and not prepared for duty to complete the last link in a net of I.S.P cruisers that were surrounding a space pirate because he was at the Jovian Chamber. While back there, he becomes quite alert because there is a Martian looking at him with pure hatred in his eyes. A dancer flings herself onto his lap and the Martian comes rushing to attack Dennis. Dennis is able to avoid the attack and the police come and take the Martian away. The Martian turns out to be a wanted pirate crew member, and this capture allows Dennis to be positioned in a more favorable view by the commander of the I.S.P. \n\nDennis goes to meet the commander and the commander tells him some troubling news. He states that Marla\u2019s ship is unable to be contacted and is multiple days overdue for contact. The commander tells Dennis that joining the mission would be his opportunity to redeem his reputation and Dennis is readily prepared to accept and wants to leave immediately. They eventually do leave and spend the first couple of days searching in space with no luck. However, they do eventually spot something in the distance and prepare all stations for incoming possibilities. They board a ship finding no survivors and the ship to be without cargo.  When they return to their ship, George excitedly greets them telling them that the radar is picking up a possible trail of a space. Dennis is hopeful that it is Koerber.

He spends his days in the Jovian Chamber, a place on Venus where the desires of its men are met constantly; despite this, his mind is only on his fiancee, Marla, whose letter he rereads while she is on a trip to Terra. One night at the chamber, Dennis is suddenly attacked by a strange Martian man, who he fights off and defeats. The police later discover that the Martian man was in possession of a forbidden weapon, inferring that he is part of Koerber's crew. Dennis then meets the I.S.P Commander in his office, where he is informed that a ship, the ship that was supposed to take Marla to Terra, has vanished, and all signs point to Koerber. The Commander gives Dennis a final chance to redeem himself and defeat Koerber for good, equipping him with a crew and an upgraded cruiser that can travel at record speed. Aboard the cruiser, Dennis eventually finds the vanished ship, but unfortunately no hopeful signs of survival from the destruction. Heartbroken by the loss of Marla, Dennis advises his crew to return back, when they notice Koerber's ship approaching. Dennis challenges the ship to a battle, sending cannons and jets to crash into the ship. However, Koerber's ship is quickly approaching the surface of a planet, and Koerber sends a magnetic beam to bring Dennis' cruiser down with him. Dennis panics and orders George Randall, the youngest on the crew, to cut the jets and use magentic repulsion, but Randall does not respond. Another crew member eventually cuts the jets, but not early enough, and the cruiser is stranded on the unknown planet.

He is at the Jovian Chamber in the Inter-planetary Palace on Venus, where it is highly regarded as an elusive place that costs a fortune to enter. He drinks and makes eye contact with a young martian, who stares at him back with hatred. A Mercurian dancer flings herself onto his lap, and the Martian leaps up to attack him while the other guests are distracted. Dennis manages to knock the Martian, and the international police find out that the Martian is a member of Bren Koerber\u2019s pirate crew. The Police Lieutenant Gillian mentions that they should radio the I.S.P., but Dennis reveals that he is grounded from the organization. The lieutenant still insists that he come to Terra with him. Later, the I.S.P. commander frowns when he sees Dennis walk into the office. He explains that they brought him here for two reasons. The first reason is tracking down Koerber\u2019s orbit of piracy by capturing one of his henchmen. The second reason is about the disappearance of Marla and the loss of contact with the interplanetary spacer that she was on. In his despair, Dennis begs the commander for one more opportunity to bring back Koerber or die trying. He then sees a visual record of the passenger spacer. They later embark on the trip, and the spacer they are in gets attacked by atom shells. The commander tells Dennis that he can use the new cruiser equipped to deal with these dangers. His expedition is the first assignment for many of the crew members. As they are about to give up, the cruiser finds what is left of a passenger cruiser. Everybody wants to be a part of the boarding party except for George Randall because he still feels nauseous about the idea. Tom, Scotty, and Dallas are chosen to go with Dennis. Dennis finishes creating the survey about the liners left, and they leave. Randall tells them that another spacer is somewhere close behind them, and Dennis hopes it is Koerber. He observes Koerber\u2019s cruiser through the viso-screen, but it suddenly maneuvers once it realizes that the I.S.P. cruiser is nearby too. Although it tries to lose Dennis and his crew, Koerber\u2019s cruiser is unsuccessful, and the two cruisers begin fighting. He sees the shadow behind Koerber\u2019s ship and avoids getting hit by a beam that the enemy cruiser fires. Randall is given orders to cut the engines, but he does not follow them. The cruiser is forced to land in the middle of nowhere of unfamiliar territory. They discuss ways to get out of the area, and Dennis asks to see Randall. They talk briefly, and Dennis treats Randall much more kindly after seeing his first trip into the outer orbits. Even though the others are angry at Randall, he tells them there will be no feuds on the ship, and they re-enter the cruiser. \n"

The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune.

There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke.

        "Summary_1": "Marla used to be a fiancee of Dennis, but she broke up with him and left for an assignment. Her poignant last letter pained Dennis, but he kept rereading it, delving into drinks, dancers and images of Marla. This condition even caused him to fail his commander and be grounded. The break up left a huge void in Dennis and he had no desire to see other women. The news of her disappearance made Dennis pale and silent, he felt extreme pain, which was soon accompanied by anger towards Koerber. Dennis desired to rush that very second to search for Marla and bring Koerber, risking his own life. All the time without success Dennis was slowly losing hope, and when he didn't find any survivors, he was silent and devastated with the loss of hope to find Marla.",
        "Summary_2": "Dennis recounts how the loss of Marla has left a void in his heart that hurts him. His repeated reading of a letter that she has left him shows that Dennis longs for Marla and wishes to be reunited with her because of his love for her.

At the beginning of the story, he is rereading the last letter that Marla wrote him before leaving, and even when at the Jovian Chamber, a palace meant to meet anyone's desires, Dennis can only think of Marla and her beauty. Dennis' feelings towards Marla are also apparent when he gets the news of Marla's ship being seized by Koerber.",

He is heartbroken over the letter that she initially sent him and cannot bring himself to enjoy anything in the Jovian Chamber. When the commander tells him that his wife has potentially fallen into the hands of Koerber, he does not hesitate to hunt the criminal down for her. He is also very determined because of her, effortlessly taking on his duties as captain and giving out fast orders if it means that they will be reunited sooner.

Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\n  \n<doc-sep>Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided\nthe murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and\nplanted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all\nMartians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the\nMartian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin\nthat staggered and all but dropped him.\n  \n \n  The Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered back\nand sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But he\nwas not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight for\nDennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis took\nit, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride over\nwith all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw and\nspun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowly\nsagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor.\n  \n \n  Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the international\npolice arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life. Upon search,\nthe police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under his\nleft arm-pit\u2014an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout the\ninterplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates still\nwithout the law were known to possess them.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck,\nBrooke!\" The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. \"If\nI'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew.\nWho else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and have\nin his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete records\non that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps they\nhave details on this dandy!\" He eyed admiringly the priceless Martian\nembroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border of\nred, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black\n   \n   acerine\n   \n  on his finger.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put to\nshame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile curved\nhis generous mouth. \"I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture of\nKoerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again\u2014you don't know\nBertram! To him an infraction of rules is a major crime. Damn Venus!\"\nHe reached for his glass of\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  but the table had turned over\nduring the struggle, and the glass was a shattered mass of gleaming\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  shards. He laughed shortly as he became conscious of the\nvenomous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of the excited voices of the\nguests and the emphatic disapproval of the Venusian proprietor who\nwas shocked at having a brawl in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive\nPalace.\n  \n \n  \"Better come to Headquarters with me, Dennis,\" the lieutenant said\ngently. \"We'll say you captured him, and if he's Koerber's, the\ncredit's yours. A trip to Terra's what you need, Venus for you is a\nhoodoo!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The stern, white haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminil\ndesk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six foot\nfour frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as\nif uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a\ndecision, he were forcing himself to speak:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for\ntwo reasons.

The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose\ningredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.\n  \n \n  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco\nsmoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and\nthere, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,\nMartians or Venusians.\n  \n \n  Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it\nwas the dead man's hand.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Coma esta, senor?\n   \n  \" a small voice piped. \"\n   \n   Speken die Deutsch?\nDesirez-vous d'amour? Da?

He was like\na red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn\nskivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.\n  \n \n  \"I'm American,\" Ben muttered.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\n   \n   buena\n   \n  !

Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he\nsank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the\nmaneuver avoided it.\n  \n \n  \"George Randall!\" He shouted desperately into the speaker. \"Cut all\njets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed\nout of the increasing gravity trap.\n  \n \n  \"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the\njets!\" But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then\nKoerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught,\nforced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of\na whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that\nshook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.\n  \n \n  Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to\nmeet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy.\nIt showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active.\nGravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this\nunknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time\nwas supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could\npossibly explain the incredible gravity.\n  \n \n  And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to\nRandall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes\nhimself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action,\ntoo late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent\na crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding\nthem in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided\na man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser,\nthe strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them,\nwas anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against\nthe sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in\nthe cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could\nreach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty much of a mess!\" Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he\nturned to Scotty Byrnes. \"What's your opinion? Think we can patch her\nup, or are we stuck here indefinitely?\"\n  \n \n  Scotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into\nthe forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower\npetals. The crash-landing had not helped either.\n  \n \n  \"Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain,\nbut,\" he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.\n  \n \n  \"But what? Speak up man!\" It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his\nordinarily gentle voice like a lash.\n  \n \n  \"But, you may as well know it,\" Scotty replied quietly. \"That parting\nshot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use the\nemergency tank to make it down here!\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. Dennis\nBrooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tom\ntugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed\nmournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long,\nragged line of cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"I think we got Koerber, though,\" he said at last. \"While Tom was doing\na job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast\nand out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with Koerber!\" Tom Jeffery exploded. \"You mean we're stuck in\nthis hellish rock-pile?\"\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Tom!\" Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale,\nimpassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. \"Where's Randall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably hiding his head under a bunk!\" Dallas laughed with scorn. His\ncontemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who\nfailed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place\nin the I.S.P.\n  \n \n  \"Considering the gravity of this planetoid,\" Dennis Brooke said\nthoughtfully, \"it's going to take some blast to get us off!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for\nour atom-busters to chew on!\" Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal\noptimist.\n  \n \n  \"Better break out those repair plates,\" Dennis said to Scotty. \"Tom,\nyou get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log\nbook, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try\nto find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,\" he said in a\nlow voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.\n  \n \n  A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear\nthe last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead\nbumped during the crash landing.\n  \n \n  \"Captain ... I ... I wanted ...\" he paused unable to continue.\n  \n \n  \"You wanted what?\" Captain Brooke's voice was terse. \"Perhaps you\nwanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding\njob....\" That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the\nwords had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His\ncandid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage\nwith its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened\nthe anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized\nthis was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better\nmen than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there had\nbeen an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in\nthe grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung\nhis neck!\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, Randall,\" he replied in a much more kindly tone. \"We'll\nneed all hands now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you, sir!\" Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his\nmouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon\nhim, he whirled and re-entered the ship.\n  \n \n  \"But for him we wouldn't be here!\" Dallas exclaimed. \"Aagh!\" He shook\nhis head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chin\nshook like gelatin. \"Cowards are hell!\" He spat.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance.\" Dennis observed.\n  \n \n  \"You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake in\nthis than we, and he's spoiled it for you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" Dennis nodded. \"But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feuds\non my ship. Get it!\" The last two words cut like a scimitar.\n  \n \n  Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spat\na thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground. One by one they\nre-entered the cruiser.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n<doc-sep>He was lucky. He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last\nflight before retirement. Discipline was lax, investigation of new\npersonnel even more so.\n  \n \n  Ben Curtis made it to Venus.\n  \n \n  There was just one flaw in his decision. He hadn't realized that the\nmemory of the dead man's face would haunt him, torment him, follow him\nas constantly as breath flowed into his lungs.\n  \n \n  But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead\nvoice? Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways\nobscure the dead face?\n  \n \n  So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent red-bearded giant,\nand hoping and doubting and fearing, all at once.\n  \n \n  \"You look for someone,\n   \n   senor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He jumped. \"Oh. You still here?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Oui.\n   \n  \" The Martian kid grinned, his mouth full of purple teeth. \"I\nkeep you company on your first night in Hoover City,\n   \n   n'est-ce-pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't my first night here,\" Ben lied. \"I've been around a while.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are spacemen?\"\n  \n \n  Ben threw a fifty-cent credit piece on the table. \"Here. Take off, will\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin. \"\n   \n   Ich danke, senor.\n   \n  You\nknow why city is called Hoover City?\"\n  \n \n  Ben didn't answer.\n  \n \n  \"They say it is because after women come, they want first thing a\nthousand vacuum cleaners for dust. What is vacuum cleaner,\n   \n   monsieur\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ai-yee\n   \n  , I go. You keep listen to good Martian music.\"\n  \n \n  The toothpick of a body melted into the semi-darkness.\n  \n \n  Minutes passed. There were two more whiskeys. A ceaseless parade of\nfaces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed him\u2014reddish balloon\nfaces, scaly reptilian faces, white-skinned, slit-eyed faces, and\noccasionally a white, rouged, powdered face. But nowhere was there a\nface with a red beard.\n  \n \n  A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis. Hoover City was but one of\na dozen cities of Venus. Each had twenty dives such as this.\n  \n \n  He needed help.\n  \n \n  But his picture must have been 'scoped to Venusian visiscreens. A\nreward must have been offered for his capture. Whom could he trust? The\nMartian kid, perhaps?\n  \n \n  Far down the darkened aisle nearest him, his eyes caught a flash of\nwhite. He tensed.\n  \n \n  Like the uniform of a Security Policeman, he thought.\n  \n \n  His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness.\n  \n \n  And then he saw another and another and another.\n  \n \n  Each whiteness became brighter and closer, like shrinking spokes of a\nwheel with Ben as their focal point.\n  \n \n \n   You idiot! The damned Martian kid! You should have known!\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Dennis was forced to fight back and exit his state of stagnation, caused by being grounded at work and left by fiancee. When he overcame the enemy, the least turned out to be a space pirate, bearing a prohibited weapon. That way Dennis stopped and imprisoned a criminal, who turned out to possess useful information about Koerber's present activities. This helpful action, together with Dennis' personal interest in success of the mission and his skills of a spacer, made the commander give Dennis a chance to redeem himself. For that reason Dennis was sent to search for Koerber and he set out for the adventure.",
        "Summary_2": "The Martian fails to successfully attack Dennis as he is able to maneuver out of the way to prevent a painful or deadly attack. The Martian is captured by the police and they tell Dennis that he had a forbidden weapon on him, an atomic disintegrator. That type of weapon is only found on space pirates or criminals. It turns out that the Martian was a member of a pirate crew, specifically Koerber\u2019s pirate crew. Dennis aiding the capture of this Martian is important because it puts him in a more favorable position with the commander of the I.S.P. ",
        "Summary_3": "Though the Martian man who attacks Dennis seems random, it is later revealed by the Police Lieutenant that the Martian was in possession of an atomic-disintegrator, which is a forbidden weapon. This, in addition to the attack, leads them to suspect that the Martian man is part of Koerber's pirate team. Dennis had previously been grounded by the I.S.P, but his brawl with the Martian man gives him the opportunity to be back on the I.S.P's good side. The Police Lieutenant tells Dennis that if the Martian turned out to be one of Koerber's men, he would allow Dennis to take the credit for his capture, which ends up working.",
        "Summary_4": "The Martian man attacking Dennis reveals more critical information about Koerber, the criminal\u2019s whereabouts, and how Dennis later becomes involved. Even though Denis is temporarily not allowed to interact with the I.S.P., the Martian man attacking him creates an opportunity for him to go back to the organization. Furthermore, he is also aware of Marla\u2019s situation from going to I.S.P., and he goes immediately to hunt down Koerber. For the commander, this Martian\u2019s attack also means that the location of their lost passengers and cargo must be found soon. The attack sets up the plot for the majority of the story, and it also helps Dennis become motivated enough to go and rescue Marla. \n"

        "Query": "How is Dennis treated at work and what is his profession as an I.S.P. captain in THE SOUL EATERS?",
        "Article": "The stern, white haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminil\ndesk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six foot\nfour frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as\nif uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a\ndecision, he were forcing himself to speak:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for\ntwo reasons. The first one you already know\u2014your capture of one of\nKoerber's henchmen\u2014has given us a line as to his present orbit of\npiracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's not\nreally why I've brought you here.\" He frowned again as if what he had\nto say were difficult indeed.\n  \n \n  \"Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her\u2014a\ndelicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, and\nvery clever young lady could perform. And,\" he paused, grimacing,\n\"somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringing\nher and several other passengers, began to send distress signals.\nFinally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three days\noverdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untold\nmillions, the spacer itself\u2014seem to have vanished.\"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazel\neyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slits\nthat smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides,\nwhile something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruel\nprecision.\n  \n \n  \"Marla!\" He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the power\nof Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like an\natom-blast.\n  \n \n  \"Commander,\" Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths of\nemotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself\u2014and\nthat grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another known\nevery change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul.\n\"Commander, give me one ...\n   \n   one\n   \n  chance at that spawn of unthinkable\nbegetting! Let me try, and I promise you ...\" in his torture, Dennis\nwas unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surface\nof the priceless desk, \"I promise you that I will either bring you\nKoerber, or forfeit my life!\"\n  \n \n  Commander Bertram nodded his head. \"I brought you here for that\npurpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, where\nthe last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!\"\n  \n \n  He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast set\non his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. \"You'll now see\na visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that left\nVenus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vessel\nin space. This, Dennis,\" the Commander emphasized his words, \"is your\nchance to redeem yourself!\" He fell silent, while the viso-screen began\nto show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacer\nup-tilted in its cradle.\n  \n<doc-sep>  THE SOUL EATERS\n  \n \n  By WILLIAM CONOVER\n  \n \n  Firebrand Dennis Brooke had one final chance\n   \n  to redeem himself by capturing Koerber whose\n   \n  ships were the scourge of the Void. But his\n   \n  luck had run its course, and now he was\n   \n  marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save\n   \n  himself from a menace weapons could not kill.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"\n   \n   And so, my dear\n   \n  ,\" Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase, \"\n   \n   I'm\nafraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets\u2014or\nis it six?

Anyway,\nthere will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've\naccepted. I did love you.... Good-by.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last\nletter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they\nnever failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as\nthe palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a\nperpetual wonder\u2014limpid as a child's.\n  \n \n  The barbaric rhythms of the\n   \n   Congahua\n   \n  , were a background of annoyance\nin Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian\ndancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace,\nbegan to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\n  \n<doc-sep>Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser, a surprise awaited them. It was young George\nRandall, whose excited face met them as soon as they had entered the\nairlocks and removed the space suits.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Brooke ... Captain, recordings are showing on the new 'Jet\nAnalyzers' must be the trail of some spacer. Can't be far!\" He was\nfairly dancing in his excitement, as if the marvelous work of the\nnew invention that detected the disturbance of atomic jets at great\ndistance were his own achievement.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke smiled. His own heart was hammering, and inwardly he\nprayed that it were Koerber. It had to be! No interplanetary passenger\nspacer could possibly be out here at the intersection of angles Kp\n39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. None\nbut a pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could dare! This was the\ndangerous asteroid belt, where even planetoids drifted in eccentric\nuncharted orbits.\n  \n \n  Dennis, Tom Jeffery and Scotty Byrnes raced to the control room,\nfollowed by the ponderous Dallas to whom hurry in any form was\nanathema. There could be no doubt now! The \"Jet Analyzer\" recorded\npowerful disturbance, atomic\u2014could be nothing else.\n  \n \n  Instantly Captain Brooke was at the inter-communication speaker:\n  \n \n  \"Crew, battle stations! Engine room, full speed!\"\n  \n \n  Scotty Byrnes was already dashing to the engine room, where his beloved\nmotors purred with an ascending hum. Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser each\nmember of the crew raced to his assigned task without delay. Action\nimpended, and after days and nights of inertia, it was a blessed\nrelief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces, and the banter of men\nsuddenly galvanized by a powerful incentive was bandied back and forth.\nAll but George Randall. Now that action was imminent. Something gripped\nhis throat until he could hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S.P.\nuniform. A growing nausea gripped his bowels, and although he strove to\nkeep calm, his hands trembled beyond control.\n  \n \n  In the compact, super-armored control room, Captain Brooke watched\nthe telecast's viso-screen, with hungry eyes that were golden with\nanticipation. It seemed to him as if an eternity passed before at\nlast, a black speck danced on the illuminated screen, until it finally\nreached the center of the viso-screen and remained there. It grew by\nleaps and bounds as the terrific speed of the cruiser minimized the\ndistance long before the quarry was aware of pursuit.\n  \n \n  But at last, when the enemy cruiser showed on the viso-screen,\nunmistakably for what it was\u2014a pirate craft, it showed by its sudden\nmaneuver that it had detected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had described\na parabola in space and headed for the dangerous asteroid belt. As if\nnavigated by a masterly hand that knew each and every orbit of the\nasteroids, it plunged directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to lose\nthe I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneuver. Ordinarily, it would have\nsucceeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such\na trap without specific orders. But to Dennis Brooke, directing the\nchase from the control room, even certain death was welcome, if only he\ncould take Koerber with him.\n  \n \n  Weaving through the deadly belt for several hours, Dennis saw his\nquarry slow down. Instantly he seized the chance and ordered a salvo\nfrom starboard. Koerber's powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up\nspewing Genton-shells. The battle was on at last.\n  \n \n  From the banked atom-cannon of the I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain\nof atomic fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged rent back toward\nmidship showed on Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if it had been\nmortally wounded. Then Dennis maneuvered his cruiser into a power\ndive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the space lane above him, but as\nhe came up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was\nripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under\nthe detonating impact.\n  \n \n  It was then that Dennis Brooke saw the immense dark shadow looming\nimmediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom\ndesperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass,\nbut too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no\navail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was\ndoomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful\nmagnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided\nthe murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and\nplanted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all\nMartians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the\nMartian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin\nthat staggered and all but dropped him.\n  \n \n  The Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered back\nand sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But he\nwas not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight for\nDennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis took\nit, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride over\nwith all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw and\nspun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowly\nsagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor.\n  \n \n  Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the international\npolice arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life. Upon search,\nthe police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under his\nleft arm-pit\u2014an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout the\ninterplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates still\nwithout the law were known to possess them.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck,\nBrooke!\" The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. \"If\nI'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew.\nWho else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and have\nin his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete records\non that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps they\nhave details on this dandy!\" He eyed admiringly the priceless Martian\nembroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border of\nred, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black\n   \n   acerine\n   \n  on his finger.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put to\nshame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile curved\nhis generous mouth. \"I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture of\nKoerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again\u2014you don't know\nBertram! To him an infraction of rules is a major crime. Damn Venus!\"\nHe reached for his glass of\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  but the table had turned over\nduring the struggle, and the glass was a shattered mass of gleaming\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  shards. He laughed shortly as he became conscious of the\nvenomous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of the excited voices of the\nguests and the emphatic disapproval of the Venusian proprietor who\nwas shocked at having a brawl in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive\nPalace.\n  \n \n  \"Better come to Headquarters with me, Dennis,\" the lieutenant said\ngently. \"We'll say you captured him, and if he's Koerber's, the\ncredit's yours. A trip to Terra's what you need, Venus for you is a\nhoodoo!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\nthrough a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\nexordium of\n   \n   Isaiah\n   \n  36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\nwhat was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.\n  \n \n  The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\noffal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\nspacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\nSlimeheads remember the H. M. S.\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  fiasco, for example, in which a\ngalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\nshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\nthe\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\nof the\n   \n   Benjo Maru\n   \n  incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\nhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\n   \n   Saccharomycodes\n   \n  yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\nPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\nthe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\nbite he ate to a superior grade of\n   \n   sake\n   \n  . And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\n   \n   Charles Partlow\nSale\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Sale\n   \n  blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be planted\nin the\n   \n   maria\n   \n  to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n  \n \n  Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n  \n \n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n   \n   C. P. Sale\n   \n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n  \n \n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n  \n \n  The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness.\n  \n<doc-sep>With a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennis\nmaneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he\nsank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the\nmaneuver avoided it.\n  \n \n  \"George Randall!\" He shouted desperately into the speaker. \"Cut all\njets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed\nout of the increasing gravity trap.\n  \n \n  \"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the\njets!\" But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then\nKoerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught,\nforced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of\na whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that\nshook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.\n  \n \n  Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to\nmeet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy.\nIt showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active.\nGravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this\nunknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time\nwas supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could\npossibly explain the incredible gravity.\n  \n \n  And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to\nRandall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes\nhimself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action,\ntoo late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent\na crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding\nthem in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided\na man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser,\nthe strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them,\nwas anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against\nthe sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in\nthe cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could\nreach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty much of a mess!\" Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he\nturned to Scotty Byrnes. \"What's your opinion? Think we can patch her\nup, or are we stuck here indefinitely?\"\n  \n \n  Scotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into\nthe forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower\npetals. The crash-landing had not helped either.\n  \n \n  \"Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain,\nbut,\" he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.\n  \n \n  \"But what? Speak up man!\" It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his\nordinarily gentle voice like a lash.\n  \n \n  \"But, you may as well know it,\" Scotty replied quietly. \"That parting\nshot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use the\nemergency tank to make it down here!\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. Dennis\nBrooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tom\ntugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed\nmournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long,\nragged line of cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"I think we got Koerber, though,\" he said at last. \"While Tom was doing\na job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast\nand out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with Koerber!\" Tom Jeffery exploded. \"You mean we're stuck in\nthis hellish rock-pile?\"\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Tom!\" Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale,\nimpassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. \"Where's Randall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably hiding his head under a bunk!\" Dallas laughed with scorn. His\ncontemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who\nfailed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place\nin the I.S.P.\n  \n \n  \"Considering the gravity of this planetoid,\" Dennis Brooke said\nthoughtfully, \"it's going to take some blast to get us off!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for\nour atom-busters to chew on!\" Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal\noptimist.\n  \n \n  \"Better break out those repair plates,\" Dennis said to Scotty. \"Tom,\nyou get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log\nbook, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try\nto find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,\" he said in a\nlow voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.\n  \n \n  A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear\nthe last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead\nbumped during the crash landing.\n  \n \n  \"Captain ... I ... I wanted ...\" he paused unable to continue.\n  \n \n  \"You wanted what?\" Captain Brooke's voice was terse. \"Perhaps you\nwanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding\njob....\" That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the\nwords had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His\ncandid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage\nwith its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened\nthe anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized\nthis was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better\nmen than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there had\nbeen an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in\nthe grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung\nhis neck!\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, Randall,\" he replied in a much more kindly tone. \"We'll\nneed all hands now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you, sir!\" Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his\nmouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon\nhim, he whirled and re-entered the ship.\n  \n \n  \"But for him we wouldn't be here!\" Dallas exclaimed. \"Aagh!\" He shook\nhis head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chin\nshook like gelatin. \"Cowards are hell!\" He spat.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance.\" Dennis observed.\n  \n \n  \"You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake in\nthis than we, and he's spoiled it for you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" Dennis nodded. \"But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feuds\non my ship. Get it!\" The last two words cut like a scimitar.\n  \n \n  Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spat\na thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground.

However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring\nsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,\nwas where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test\nwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n  \n \n  The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran\nLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No\nindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how\ngreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so\nimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason\nwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at\nthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the\npopulation.\n  \n \n  The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve\nthe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former\nPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the\nfact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,\nafter considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method\nof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,\nhad come up with this program.\n  \n \n  It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he\nfelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the\nBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,\nlargely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,\nas a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the\nstatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of\nthe planet, there was no choice.\n  \n \n  But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his\nanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one\nprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was\nnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies\nwhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in\nlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive\nsociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru\nshould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy\nof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran\nprimitive tradition of romance.\n  \n \n  \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were\nout of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me!

The girl was beautiful,\nin a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left\nhim cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts\nin silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not\nto speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom\nupon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one\nsolitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n  \n \n  Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending.\nWhen the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of\nMarla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not\nfill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded.\nTrue, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his\nfault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian\nChamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been\nready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers\nthat almost surrounded the space pirate.\n  \n \n  A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every\ndream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use\nof hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as\nif by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's\nsoul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality\nunder the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n  \n \n  It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a\nfortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a\nsheaf of credits\u2014it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and\nmost of his heart in Marla.\n  \n \n  Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the\ninsidious\n   \n   Verbena\n   \n  , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty\nglass of Martian\n   \n   Bacca-glas\n   \n  , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel\neyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a\nyoung Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in\nthose eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy?\nDennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger\nbrought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could\ninstantly denote.\n  \n \n  His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed\nslightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this\nMartian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter\nhad edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad\nsemi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in\na final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and\ntilted back invitingly.\n  \n \n  Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the\nhandsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the\ntinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand,\nand a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his\nfeet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one\nside as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis\nBrooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl\ncried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was\nnot there.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story starts on Venus, in a pleasure palace where Dennis is trying to distract himself from his ex-fiancee and being grounded on his job. After an attack followed by Dennis' victory, he proceeds Headquarters with the police and soon enters the I.S.P. commander's office. From there he immediately sets off to space on a ship, searching for days through the space for any signs of pirates or the disappeared spaceship. The first stop is the remnants of transport lacking any use. The second is a detected pirate spaceship, which the crew starts to follow. The setting of the chase remains in space, and after being engulfed by a Planetoid, the crew find itself in a strange world. The setting was rocky and looked deadly. Only desolate vista was seen around. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dennis is at the Jovian Chamber which is a place that caters to a man\u2019s desire. Then Dennis is taken to the headquarters for the I.S.P, to talk to the commander. He goes to the office of the commander and learns some troubling news about Marla. The crew, along with Dennis and the commander, spend days on a spaceship searching space for Marla\u2019s ship and a pirate ship. When they spot a trail of a spacer, Dennis notes that they are at the intersection of angles Kp at 39 degrees, for 12 minutes, Fp at 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. They fall into an unknown planetoid where the atmosphere is breathable but does not allow for much exertion. ",
        "Summary_3": "The beginning of the story takes place in the Jovian Chamber within the Inter-planetary Palace on Venus, where Dennis is staying after being grounded by the I.S.P. The chamber is a luxurious, royal place with drinks, dancers, and anything a man could desire. After the brawl with a Martian, Dennis goes to the I.S.P Commander's office, where he is given a new mission and cruiser, which is updated with intense speed. Once the mission begins, Dennis spends days on the cruiser, which despite being efficient, lacks comfortable space and offices like the other cruisers do. Eventually, the cruiser crashes onto an unknown planet, with strong gravity, intimidating soils and valleys, and iridescent ground. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story initially takes place on Venus. The Jovian Chamber is packed, and there is the loud sound of the barbaric rhythms of \"Congahua\" in the background.  There is a beautiful Mercurian dancer who weaves amongst the crowd too. There are also tables to sit and have drinks at. After Venus, the story takes place briefly in Commander Bertram\u2019s office at the I.S.P. There is a large aluminil desk and a small telecast set on it. Then, the story takes place in space as they chase down Koerber's cruiser. The cruiser itself has an engine room, a control room, and bunks for rest. One of the other cruisers they encounter has everything in place, except for a noticeably missing amount of cargo. Finally, when they crash, the place the crew crashes in is very difficult to breathe. There are towering jugs that jut raggedly against the sky and iridescent soil for the narrow valley. The crew is the only people there, and there is just nothing that stretches into the horizon."

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>She shrugged. \"We have friends who can be bribed.

He is completely alone, but doesn't fear loneliness, he welcomes it, and the idea that it might drive him mad one day. His job is to wait, looking out at the expanse of nothingness around him. He is an overseer, to prepare the atmosphere for colonization. One day, Manet thinks he sees a spaceship land near his station. He puts on his pressure suit and heads out to see what it is. As he walks towards it, he finds himself in a rustic log cabin, where a lean, tall man stands, waiting for him. The man calls himself \"Trader Tom\", and offers him a very interesting service. He tells Manet that he will give him a special credit card that will allow him to purchase anything he can think of. Manet's estate would cover the cost, and when Manet asks the man what would happen if he had no estate, Trader Tom simply says that this is a risk that he, and his business, take. Trader Tom asks what would Manet like, to which he replies: to not be alone. Manet signs some paperwork and is given the credit card. \nManet is given a box, it is called \"LIFO, the socialisation kit\". The box contains various items from a person's lifetime. On top is a book entitled \"The Making Of Friends and Others''. It orders the user to find the modifier, which Manet cannot locate. He goes to work anyway, on making his first friend with the tools inside the kit. \nHis first friend he creates is named Ronald. He seems sweet at first but his incessant optimism and lack of intelligence finally becomes too much for Manet. Manet decides to lock Ronald in a room away from him. He is stuck on this planet for the next eighteen years, and will need some kind of company. He goes to work on creating his second companion, a girl. \nVeronica is sweet, she talks kindly to Manet, and throws herself at him, which he swerves. Manet thinks her to be even more stupid than Ronald, and ends up striking her, which he finds he enjoys. He locks her in the same room as Ronald. \nManet once again goes back to the box, and goes to the last page of the handbook, entitled, \"The Final Model\". He creates this new being, whom he calls Victor. Victor jumps to life, and into the kit, destroying the item that Manet now realises was the modifier. Vitor explains to Manet that he is his enemy. He is just as intelligent as Manet, and is his designated adversary. Now that the modifier is destroyed, Manet will have no way to ever alter Veronica or Ronald, and will be stuck with the same silly, innocent people as he grows old. Manet will be bored for eighteen years. Manet replies to Victor, explaining, now that he has an enemy, he will never be bored. ",
        "Summary_2": "William Manet is an extremely lonely man and is the only human who works at his station. He is part of a small pressure group called the Workers\u2019 Union and works as an Overseer that focuses on the colonization of Mars. He cannot leave his job, but it has a high salary and good future opportunities. Manet sees a spaceship land nearby, and he begins to think he is hallucinating. He goes out to meet the spaceship, and the other man introduces himself as Trader Tom. He says that he serves the wants of spacemen and represents free enterprise. When Manet is suspicious, Tom explains that his businessmen have gone back to the barter system. Furthermore, Manet can also apply for the Trader Tom\u2019s Credit Card and have charges deducted from his estate as payment. He tells Tom that he wants to be alone, and Tom lets him sign a card. He is then given a socialization kit, to which Tom tells him that there have been no complaints about it so far. Manet ignores the box for as long as possible, but he eventually gives in and opens it. There is a collection of junk inside the box and a book titled The Making of Friends and Others. The book gives him instructions on how to create his friend. He then begins to play games with his new friend Ronald. He makes Ronald as somebody with opposite traits as him and enjoys knowing more than his new friend. After a while, however, Manet gets annoyed by Ronald, and the two of them fight. The time then skips to Spring, and Manet has locked Ronald away hoping that he will shut down by himself. He then gets a transmission from the B.B.C, explaining that the estimated time of departure for the Overseers was now eighteen years. Manet then goes back to the box, where he tries to find the Modifier amongst the many parts to shut down or change Ronald. Instead, he creates a girl named Veronica to keep him company. Veronica\u2019s personality is very shallow, and she constantly speaks of things that Manet considers stupid. He locks her up in the same place where he keeps Ronald, and both try to persuade him to let them out. Manet tries to find the Modifier again but instead finds the steps to create one final model. He does so and names it Victor. Suddenly, Victor destroys the Modifier and proclaims himself as Manet\u2019s enemy. He tells Manet that he will do everything he can to defeat him and. Victor says that his biggest accomplishment is destroying the Modifier, so Veronica, Ronald, and himself will continue to exist in the same way forever. Manet, however, is not afraid or concerned about Victor at all. He sees the \u201cenemy\u201d as an obstacle who must be triumphed and exclaims that he does not need friends if he has Victor as an enemy. ",
        "Summary_3": "William Manet is a man stranded alone on Mars. He has taken a job as an Overseer, hired to monitor several Seeders scattered on the planet in order to prepare Earth for colonization of the planet. Though the job is well-paying, Manet is to be at his station indefinitely, alone. Initially, Manet liked the idea of being alone, but he quickly became bored and lonely, and anticipated his madness. One day, Manet sees a ship landing on the surface of Mars outside; he is wary of his own mind and wonders if it is a hallucination, but he approaches the ship anyway, where he enters a cabin and meets a strange man, who refers to himself as Trader Tom. Trader Tom introduces himself and his business, which aims to serve spacemen through a bartering system. Manet is skeptical as to how such a business could exist, and how he would be able to afford whatever services are provided. Trader Tom asks Manet what it is that he wants, to which Manet expresses his loneliness. He gives Manet a Socialization Kit, which is meant to replicate human interaction. Manet makes the deal, but waits a while to open the box. When he finally decides to, he comes across a manual, which advises Manet to find the Modifier inside the kit, which is critical. However, Manet is unable to find the Modifier, as he does not know what it looks like. He ends up creating Ronald, meant to be a companion who is cheerful, pleasant, yet not as smart as Manet. Manet soon becomes tired and irritated with Ronald's repetitive nature, wearing out the same dialogue and topics of conversation. Eventually, Manet locks Ronald in his file room. He later gets a message from the B.B.C, explaining that though his estimated stay time had previously been longer, it has lowered to 18 years. Still unable to locate the Modifier, Manet creates a woman, Veronica, who also ends up being too submissive and repetitive for his taste, and he locks her in with Ronald. Manet comes across instructions for creating \"The Final Model\", which spawns Victor, who immediately destroys what must have been the Modifier. Victor explains that he is not a friend for Manet, but an enemy, meant to challenge and defeat him. Manet realizes that Victor will cure his boredom by presenting obstacles for him to work around every day.",

The salary is high but nothing is provided regarding the overseer having some human interactions or commodities. One day Manet sees a spaceship and is unsure whether it is a hallucination. Nevertheless, he enters a strange cabin and a man offers him a good whiskey. To Manet's astonishment, it turns out the spaceship is created by a free enterprise to serve the spacemen. Manet says to the service that he wants not to be alone and gets a box, the cost is unknown. He doesn't open the box until he decides he is mad. In the box there is a socialization kit with instructions. Then a game follows between Manet and someone called Ronald and a dialogue about war takes place. Very soon, Manet gets bored and tired of his companion, turns out Ronald was a copy of a human with features Manet himself picked. One day Manet listens to BBC and hears that his time left on Mars is 18 years for now. He tries to find the modifier and change Ronald, in the next scene a girl called Veronica appears. She is a submissive and seductive human copy who took the place of Ronald. She is even more stupid and backward in knowledge than her predecessor, Ronald, who has been locked this whole time which was months. Now Veronica joins Ronald in the locked room. In a while the final model pages open up in the instructions and Manet creates Victor. Victor possesses all the knowledge Manet has and is created to defeat Manet, Victor destroys the modifier and wants to make the overseer upset by that. But Manet needed an enemy all this time not to be bored and he is more than happy to have this constant obstacle always in his way. \n"

Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\n  \"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into\nhis subject now, \"that's where they'd\nbe, places like the\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  . For\none thing, a time traveler wouldn't\nbe conspicuous. At a festival like this\nsomebody with a strange accent, or\nwho didn't know exactly how to wear\nhis clothes correctly, or was off the\nordinary in any of a dozen other\nways, wouldn't be noticed. You could\nbe a four-armed space traveler from\nMars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous\nat the\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  . People\nwould figure they had D.T.'s.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why would a time traveler\nwant to go to a\u2014\" Betty began.\n  \n \n  \"Why not! What better opportunity\nto study a people than when they\nare in their cups? If\n   \n   you\n   \n  could go\nback a few thousand years, the things\nyou would wish to see would be a\nRoman Triumph, perhaps the Rites\nof Dionysus, or one of Alexander's\norgies. You wouldn't want to wander\nup and down the streets of, say,\nAthens while nothing was going on,\nparticularly when you might be revealed\nas a suspicious character not\nbeing able to speak the language, not\nknowing how to wear the clothes and\nnot familiar with the city's layout.\"\nHe took a deep breath. \"No ma'am,\nyou'd have to stick to some great\nevent, both for the sake of actual\ninterest and for protection against being\nunmasked.\"\n  \n \n  The old boy wound it up. \"Well,\nthat's the story. What are your rates?\nThe\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  starts on Friday and\ncontinues for sixteen days. You can\ntake the plane to Munich, spend a\nweek there and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Simon was shaking his head. \"Not\ninterested.\"\n  \n \n  As soon as Betty had got her jaw\nback into place, she glared unbelievingly\nat him.\n  \n \n  Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself.\n\"See here, young man, I realize\nthis isn't an ordinary assignment,\nhowever, as I said, I am willing to\nrisk a considerable portion of my\nfortune\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be\ndone.\"\n  \n \n  \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\"\nMr. Oyster said quietly. \"I\nlike the fact that you already seem\nto have some interest and knowledge\nof the matter. I liked the way you\nknew my name when I walked in the\ndoor; my picture doesn't appear often\nin the papers.\"\n  \n \n  \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality\nin his voice.\n  \n \n  \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if\nyou bring me a time traveler.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out of the question,\" Simon\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   why\n   \n  ?\" Betty wailed.\n  \n \n  \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the\ntwo of them sourly, \"suppose I tell\nyou a funny story. It goes like\nthis:\"\n  \n \n \n  I got a thousand dollars from Mr.\nOyster (Simon began) in the way\nof an advance, and leaving him with\nBetty who was making out a receipt,\nI hustled back to the apartment and\npacked a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\nanyway, this was a natural. On\nthe way to Idlewild I stopped off at\nthe Germany Information Offices for\nsome tourist literature.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly three and a half\nhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\nI spent the time planning the\nfun I was going to have.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly seven and a half\nhours from Gander to Shannon and\nI spent that time dreaming up material\nI could put into my reports to\nMr. Oyster. I was going to have to\ngive him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a\nlaugh!\n  \n \n  Between Shannon and Munich a\nfaint suspicion began to simmer in\nmy mind. These statistics I read on\nthe\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  in the Munich tourist\npamphlets. Five million people\nattended annually.\n  \n \n  Where did five million people\ncome from to attend an overgrown\nfestival in comparatively remote\nSouthern Germany? The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n  \n \n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n  \n \n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Theresienwiese\n   \n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway. I was stiff from the plane ride\nso I walked.\n <doc-sep>The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n  \n \n  \"So far. Keep talking.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\n  \n \n  The man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n  \n \n  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n  \n \n  \"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n  \n \n  \"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n  \n \n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n   \n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n  \n \n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you come from the future?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n  \n \n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on Mars. Manet is the sole occupant of the Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47. There is nothing to be seen in any direction far beyond the horizon. Mars is described like a blank canvas. It is a boring, desolate place, which only adds to Manet's feelings of loneliness and boredom. Manet crosses from his station to Trader Tom's starship at the beginning of the story. The inner compartment of the ship is like that of a log cabin. There is a slate fireplace with black and orange log charring. The fireplace holds a crackling fire. Manet moves through different rooms in his station throughout the story. When Manet first gets the box, he puts it by a transparent wall in one of the rooms of the station. He moves from his bedroom, the file room, the tube way, to communication, to an area where he plays chess with Ronald, to the solarium,  to another room where he eventually locks both Ronald and Veronica.",
        "Summary_2": "The story is primarily set on Mars. Manet works at the Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47. The station itself is all cybernetically controlled, and all Manet has to do is sit there to monitor everything as the Overseer. The station itself is located in the middle of a chalk desert, and it is always completely barren with miles of white sand. There are many amenities at the station, including a File Room and a radio to receive transmissions from. Apart from the File Room, there is also a solarium where Manet keeps the box from Trader Tom. Additionally, he also has a place with a hatch where he keeps Ronald and Veronica locked up. ",

The station is located in the middle of a vast Mars desert, where Earth is visible in the distance as a tiny star. The interior of the station isn't the most comfortable, made of aluminum and resembling an industrial factory, though he has a transparent wall to provide him with an outside view. Manet gets a change of scene when another ship lands on Mars, where the interior is cozy and comfortable, with a fireplace. The rest of the story, however, continues in Manet's station, limited to a few rooms, including a File Room, where he keeps Ronald and Veronica.",

The station is small and can accommodate only one human - Manet. There is a starry sky over the station, a couple rooms inside, including a bedroom with a transparent wall, a file room, a corridor, a hall and a place to sit down and watch a transmission or listen to the radio. Once a spaceship with Trader Tom Service arrives, accommodating anything the guest wants inside. In Manet's case it's a cabin with a fireplace.  Then the story returns to his station which stays the same with human copies adding to its housemates one by one. "

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between Ronald and Manet in the story \"How to Make Friends\"?",
        "Article": "Manet knew it all. He had heard it all before.\n  \n \n  He was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, Daniel\nBoone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines,\nthe painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing,\n   \n   ad nauseum\n   \n  . What a\nnarrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thought\nand concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginal\nhuman being?\n  \n \n  Of course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy.\n  \n \n  Manet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties\u2014Lt. \"Hoot\" Gibson,\nSam Merwin tennis stories,\n   \n   Saturday Evening Post\n   \n  covers\u2014when he had\nfirst learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firm\nopinions on all these.\n  \n \n  He yearned for someone to challenge him\u2014to say that\n   \n   Dime Sports\n   \n  had\nbeen nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why,\n   \n   Sewanee Review\n   \n  , there\nhad been a magazine for you.\n  \n \n  Manet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than his\nown. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superior\nto the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was a\nbetter band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk.\n  \n \n  \"Ronald,\" Manet said, \"you are a terrific jerk.\"\n  \n \n  Ronald leaped up immediately and led with his right.\n  \n \n  Manet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross.\n  \n \n  Ronald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel.\n  \n \n  The two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing the\ndiesel works, closed again.\n  \n \n  Ronald leaped forward and led with his right.\n  \n \n  Manet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge of\nRonald's jaw.\n  \n \n  Ronald pinwheeled to the floor.\n  \n \n  He lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth.\n\"Had enough?\" he asked Manet.\n  \n \n  Manet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Ronald hopped up lightly. \"Another checkers, Billy Boy?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer.\"\n  \n \n  Manet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury.\n  \n \n  Ronald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get in\na fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manet\nwanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid.\n  \n \n  Manet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard.\n  \n \n  But if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it that\ntheir checker games always ended in a tie?\n  \n<doc-sep>Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Hear that?\" he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth.\n  \n \n  \"No, darling.\"\n  \n \n  Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore\nthe noise. She was still following orders.\n  \n \n  \"Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald,\" the voice carried\nthrough sepulchrally.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Manet yelled.\n  \n \n  The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off.\n  \n \n  A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it.\n  \n \n  Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took\ncomfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the\nstation.\n  \n \n  Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch.\n  \n \n  Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His\nhands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips\nseemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the\nshouting but from having nothing to drink for some months.\n  \n \n  Ronald didn't say anything to Manet.\n  \n \n  But he looked offended.\n  \n \n  \"You,\" Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back,\n\"inside, inside.\"\n  \n \n  Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl.\n  \n \n  \"Do you know what I'm going to do with you?\" Manet demanded. \"I'm going\nto lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year,\nforever! Now what do you think about that?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you think it's the\n   \n   right\n   \n  thing, dear,\" Veronica said hesitantly.\n  \n \n  \"You know best, Willy,\" Ronald said uncertainly.\n  \n \n  Manet slammed the hatch in disgust.\n  \n \n  Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of\nhis reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk\ncarefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he\nwalked too carefully for this to happen.\n  \n \n  As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: \"In my opinion,\nWilliam, you should let us out.\"\n  \n \n  \"I,\" Veronica said, \"honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill,\ndearest.\"\n  \n \n  Manet giggled. \"What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you\nback after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?\"\n  \n \n  He went down the corridor, giggling.\n  \n \n  He giggled and thought: This will never do.\n  \n<doc-sep>Veronica crept up behind Manet and slithered her hands up his back and\nover his shoulders. She leaned forward and breathed a moist warmth into\nhis ear, and worried the lobe with her even white teeth.\n  \n \n  \"Daniel Boone,\" she sighed huskily, \"only killed three Indians in his\nlife.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  Manet folded his arms stoically and added: \"Please don't talk.\"\n  \n \n  She sighed her instant agreement and moved her expressive hands over\nhis chest and up to the hollows of his throat.\n  \n \n  \"I need a shave,\" he observed.\n  \n \n  Her hands instantly caressed his face to prove that she liked a rather\nbristly, masculine countenance.\n  \n \n  Manet elbowed Veronica away in a gentlemanly fashion.\n  \n \n  She made her return.\n  \n \n  \"Not now,\" he instructed her.\n  \n \n  \"Whenever you say.\"\n  \n \n  He stood up and began pacing off the dimensions of the compartment.\nThere was no doubt about it: he had been missing his regular exercise.\n  \n \n  \"Now?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'll tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you were a jet pilot,\" Veronica said wistfully, \"you would be\nromantic. You would grab love when you could. You would never know\nwhich moment would be last. You would make the most of each one.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not a jet pilot,\" Manet said. \"There are no jet pilots. There\nhaven't been any for generations.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly,\" Veronica said. \"Who else would stop those vile North\nKoreans and Red China 'volunteers'?\"\n  \n \n  \"Veronica,\" he said carefully, \"the Korean War is over. It was finished\neven before the last of the jet pilots.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly,\" she snapped. \"If it were over, I'd know about it,\nwouldn't I?\"\n  \n \n  She would, except that somehow she had turned out even less bright,\nless equipped with Manet's own store of information, than Ronald.\nWhoever had built the Lifo kit must have had ancient ideas about what\nconstituted appropriate \"feminine\" characteristics.\n  \n \n  \"I suppose,\" he said heavily, \"that you would like me to take you back\nto Earth and introduce you to Daniel Boone?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Veronica, your stupidity is hideous.\"\n  \n \n  She lowered her long blonde lashes on her pink cheeks. \"That is a mean\nthing to say to me. But I forgive you.\"\n  \n \n  An invisible hand began pressing down steadily on the top of his head\nuntil it forced a sound out of him. \"Aaaawrraagggh! Must you be so\ncloyingly sweet? Do you have to keep taking that? Isn't there any fight\nin you at all?\"\n  \n \n  He stepped forward and back-handed her across the jaw.\n  \n \n  It was the first time he had ever struck a woman, he realized\nregretfully. He now knew he should have been doing it long ago.\n  \n \n  Veronica sprang forward and led with a right.\n  \n<doc-sep>Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual\ndiligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the\nbox to go around.\n  \n \n  The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The\nModel Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.\n  \n \n  He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make\nany one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.\n  \n \n  He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from\nhim for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.\n  \n \n  Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.\n  \n \n  But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.\n  \n \n  Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did\nso, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.\n  \n \n  He glanced forward and found the headings:\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid\na price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to\nthat? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he\ncould.\n  \n \n  He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of\nill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and\nunder his fingers....\n  \n \n  Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.\n  \n \n  Victor was finished. Perfect.\n  \n \n  Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.\n  \n \n  \"Move!\"\n  \n \n  Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the\nflesh-sprayers.\n  \n \n  As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized\nthat it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.\n  \n \n  \"It's finished!\" were Victor's first words. \"It's done!\"\n  \n \n  Manet stared at the tiny wreck. \"To say the least.\"\n  \n \n  Victor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should\nunderstand. I am different from the others.\"\n  \n \n  \"They all say that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am not your friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"No?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\"\n  \n \n  Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure\nat the symmetry of the situation.\n  \n \n  \"It completes the final course in socialization,\" Victor continued. \"I\nam your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have\n   \n   all\n   \n  your knowledge.\n   \n   You\n   \n  do not have all your knowledge. If you let\nyourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is\nmy function to use everything I possibly can against you.\"\n  \n \n  \"When do you start?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's so bad about that?\" Manet asked with some interest.\n  \n \n  \"You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never\nchange. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your\ninterest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll\nnever change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I've\nmade the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man.\n   \n   I've\nseen that you will always keep your friends.\n   \n  \"\n  \n<doc-sep>Manet didn't open the box. He let it fade quietly in the filtered but\nstill brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall.\n  \n \n  Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper\ntaste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to\nhimself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.\n  \n \n  Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk,\nsuppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the\nconclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.\n  \n \n  So he went to open the box.\n  \n \n  The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It\ncrumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the\nboxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.\n  \n \n  The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old\nchemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and\nunremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to\nhave been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime.\n  \n \n  On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the\n   \n   Reader's\nDigest\n   \n  , covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in\nblack on the spine and cover:\n   \n   The Making of Friends\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title\nin larger print and slightly amplified:\n   \n   The Making of Friends and\nOthers\n   \n  . There was no author listed. A further line of information\nstated: \"A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.\" At the bottom of\nthe title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD.,\nSYRACUSE.\n  \n \n  The unnumbered first chapter was headed\n   \n   Your First Friend\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Before you go further, first find the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  in your kit. This\nis\n   \n   vital\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He quickly riffled through the pages.\n   \n   Other Friends, Authority, A\nCompanion\n   \n  .... Then\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  . Manet tried to flip past this\nsection, but the pages after the sheet labeled\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  were\nstuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in\nthe back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to\nthis section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.\n  \n \n  Manet flipped back to page one.\n  \n \n  First find the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  in your kit. This is\n   \n   vital\n   \n  to your entire\nexperiment in socialization. The\n   \n   Modifier is Part #A-1\n   \n  on the Master\nChart.\n  \n \n  He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There\nwas nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and\nlooked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its\noutside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits.\nMaybe even the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  itself.\n  \n \n  He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He\nstudied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand.\n  \n \n  The toe bone was connected to the foot bone....\n  \n \n \n \n  The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner.\n  \n \n  The Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration.\n  \n \n  The Red King crabbed sideways one square.\n  \n \n  The Black King pounced forward one space.\n  \n \n  The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy.\n  \n \n  The Black King shuffled sideways.\n  \n \n  The Red King followed....\n  \n \n  Uselessly.\n  \n \n  \"Tie game,\" Ronald said.\n  \n \n  \"Tie game,\" Manet said.\n  \n \n  \"Let's talk,\" Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.\n  \n \n  Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him.\nCheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in\norder to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible.\n  \n \n  \"The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars,\" Ronald said\npontifically.\n  \n \n  \"Only in the air,\" Manet corrected him.\n  \n \n  Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress.\nIntelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know\nany more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to\nthat when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder.\n  \n \n  \"There were no dogfights in Korea,\" Ronald said.\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the\nlast of which took place near the end of the First World War. The\naerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not\nseen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for\nsingle passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts,\nthat this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the\nleisurely combats of World War One.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five.

It would\ngive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate\nloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him\nto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin\nteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable\nlectures to a bored and captive audience of one.\n  \n \n  He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether\nit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as\ndirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and\nthink more like a god than any man for generations.\n  \n \n  But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing\nbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.\n  \n \n  Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already\ntalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had\ncut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and\nwinked at it whenever he passed that way.\n  \n \n  Lately she was winking back at him.\n  \n \n  Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from\nhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.\n  \n \n  No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet\ncould only be this lonely on Mars.\n  \n \n  Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.\n  \n \n  All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle\nof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,\nflat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the\nblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons\nand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole\ngimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was\nneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.\n  \n \n  The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't\ntake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully\nspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb\nMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.\n  \n \n  They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people\nfor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to\nisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet\nand his fellows.\n  \n \n  The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare\nto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter\nservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations\nfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't\nproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between\nthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.\n  \n \n  But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered\nwonderful opportunities.\n  \n \n  It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making\na tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as\nbright as envy.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Tell me, you feel that now you\nare through? You have fulfilled your function?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see\nme suffer?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Yes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No. Can't do it, old man. Can't.\n   \n   I\n   \n  know. You're too human, too\nlike me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state\nof uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it.

        "Summary_1": "Ronald is Manet's first self-made friend. He constructs him using the parts he finds in the LIFO kit, and follows the manual to put him together properly. Their relationship seems jovial enough at first. They play chess together. Ronald eliminates the loneliness that Manet feels for a short time. Manet had purposely made Ronald to be cheerful, submissive and co-operative. Manet wanted Ronald to be as different to himself as he could be. Manet enjoys the fact that Ronald is not as intelligent as him. They talk about various wars, and Daniel Boone. After a while though, Manet becomes incensed by Ronalds endless, mindless droning about these same topics. Manet begins to fight Ronald, to which Ronald participates, only to please his creator. He is so fed up with Ronald eventually that he locks him in a room, and doesn't let him out. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ronald and Manet have a relationship that is initially friendly but later becomes very one-sided. Since Manet created Ronald from The Making of Friends and Others manual, all of his traits were chosen by his creator. He is cheerful, cooperative, and submissive. All of these traits make him the polar opposite of Manet. He is also suppressed in terms of intelligence, aggressiveness, and a sense of perfection. Manet and he start off playing games together, most of which almost always end in a tie. They also talk about topics such as the Korean War, Daniel Boone, New York swing, and the painting of Norman Rockwell, amongst a few other topics. Manet initially enjoys being smarter, but he is later sick of Ronald constantly talking about the same subjects. Although he knows that Ronald is only a copy of a human, he still cannot help but want to beat up his self-made friend after calling him a jerk. Manet is furious at the fact that Ronald would stupidly do anything to avoid any trouble with him. This eventually escalates to the point where Ronald is locked away and practically discarded by Manet despite being able to exist forever. ",

The two initially get along, their quality time mainly consisting of chess games and conversations about the Korean War and Daniel Boone. Manet eventually becomes irritated with Ronald, but Ronald still attempts to cater to his needs, even getting into a fistfight with Manet. Even when Manet locks Ronald into the file cabinet, Ronald remains cheerful through his pleading. He is oblivious to Manet's hatred and aims to please him no matter what, which enrages Manet even more.",
        "Summary_4": "Manet felt extremely lonely and desired communication, he created Ronald, a copy of a human from the socialization kit, as totally opposed to himself.

He let it fade quietly in the filtered but\nstill brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall.\n  \n \n  Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper\ntaste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to\nhimself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.\n  \n \n  Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk,\nsuppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the\nconclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.\n  \n \n  So he went to open the box.\n  \n \n  The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It\ncrumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the\nboxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.\n  \n \n  The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old\nchemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and\nunremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to\nhave been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime.\n  \n \n  On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the\n   \n   Reader's\nDigest\n   \n  , covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in\nblack on the spine and cover:\n   \n   The Making of Friends\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title\nin larger print and slightly amplified:\n   \n   The Making of Friends and\nOthers\n   \n  . There was no author listed. A further line of information\nstated: \"A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.\" At the bottom of\nthe title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD.,\nSYRACUSE.\n  \n \n  The unnumbered first chapter was headed\n   \n   Your First Friend\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Before you go further, first find the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  in your kit. This\nis\n   \n   vital\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He quickly riffled through the pages.\n   \n   Other Friends, Authority, A\nCompanion\n   \n  .... Then\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  . Manet tried to flip past this\nsection, but the pages after the sheet labeled\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  were\nstuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in\nthe back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to\nthis section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.\n  \n \n  Manet flipped back to page one.\n  \n \n  First find the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  in your kit. This is\n   \n   vital\n   \n  to your entire\nexperiment in socialization. The\n   \n   Modifier is Part #A-1\n   \n  on the Master\nChart.\n  \n \n  He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There\nwas nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and\nlooked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its\noutside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits.\nMaybe even the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  itself.\n  \n \n  He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He\nstudied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand.\n  \n \n  The toe bone was connected to the foot bone....\n  \n \n \n \n  The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner.\n  \n \n  The Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration.\n  \n \n  The Red King crabbed sideways one square.\n  \n \n  The Black King pounced forward one space.\n  \n \n  The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy.\n  \n \n  The Black King shuffled sideways.\n  \n \n  The Red King followed....\n  \n \n  Uselessly.\n  \n \n  \"Tie game,\" Ronald said.\n  \n \n  \"Tie game,\" Manet said.\n  \n \n  \"Let's talk,\" Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.\n  \n \n  Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him.\nCheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in\norder to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible.\n  \n \n  \"The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars,\" Ronald said\npontifically.\n  \n \n  \"Only in the air,\" Manet corrected him.\n  \n \n  Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress.\nIntelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know\nany more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to\nthat when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder.\n  \n \n  \"There were no dogfights in Korea,\" Ronald said.\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the\nlast of which took place near the end of the First World War. The\naerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not\nseen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for\nsingle passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts,\nthat this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the\nleisurely combats of World War One.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to be\nwarm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.\n\"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n  \n \n  \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n  \n \n  \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the\ncabin for dust and lint?\"\n  \n \n  \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's\nlonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,\nexcitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n  \n \n  Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to\nit, I mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well? What did it say?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n  \n \n  At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into\nFour's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.\n\"Fwiend,\" it said.\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no\nproblem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n  \n \n  In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite\na sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually\nmean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to\nsuggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dear Editor:\n  \n \n  These guys might be queer drunk hopheads. But if not? If soon brain\ndissolve, body fall apart, how long have we got? Please, anybody who\nknows answer, write to me\u2014Ivan Smernda, Plaza Ritz Arms\u2014how long is a\ngleeb?\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n  \n \n  \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n  \n \n  \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n  \n \n  \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens tried to understand that.\n  \n \n  \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n  \n \n  \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\n  \n \n  He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\n  \n \n  Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\n  \n \n  His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n  \n \n  \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\n  \n \n  Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n  \n \n  \"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\n   \n   Factory\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The Factory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\n  \n \n  Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n  \n \n  \"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\n  \n \n  It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\n  \n<doc-sep>Reno Ulrich's tiny scout plane buzzed slowly in from the distance and\nbegan circling lazily.\n  \n \n  \"Sooner than you think,\" Max told her. \"We've discovered a castaway\ncolony on the planet. They've done our tests for us by just living\nhere. If there's anything here to catch, they've caught it.\"\n  \n \n  \"People on Minos?\" Bess's handsome ruddy face grew alive with\nexcitement.\n  \n \n  \"One of them is down in the medical department,\" June said. \"He'll be\nout in twenty minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I go see him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Max. \"Show him the way to the dining hall when he gets\nout. Tell him we sent you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right!\" She turned and ran down the ramp like a small girl going to a\nfire. Max grinned at June and she grinned back. After a year and a half\nof isolation in space, everyone was hungry for the sight of new faces,\nthe sound of unfamiliar voices.\n  \n<doc-sep>The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin\nwas given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse\nanybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself,\nthe secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and\nthe tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around\nwere so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated\nmathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told\nKorvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics.\nBut that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be\nconfused by such means.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\n  \n \n  The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his\nbest not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you\ncall this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different\nfrom the one we are occupied with.\"\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the\nindicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\"\nhe said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\n  \n \n  \"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The silence this time was even longer.\n  \n \n  \"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last,\nin a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet.\nYou must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly\nto aid us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the\nonly logical deduction.\n  \n \n  But it happened to be wrong.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Manet first looks into the LIFO kit, there are a number of strange objects inside. On the top of the box is a manual on how to create these new beings, designed for companionship. In the manual, it clearly states that it is of the utmost importance to first find the modifier in the kit. It could be seen in the first part of the master chart. The only problem was, the master chart is missing. Without the master chart, Manet has no way of knowing what the modifier looked like. He decides to create these companions without it regardless. It only becomes clear what the modifier is used for towards the end of the story. When Victor is created, he immediately leaps inside the box, smashing up something Manet thinks to be a flesh sprayer. When it is destroyed, Manet finally realises that it is in fact, the Modifier. Victor explains the modifier's purpose. The modifier is used to change the artificial beings. They are created based on the creator's likes and dislikes. But, as Manet matures, and he grows out of his initial preferences, he would have the modifier to change his companions to fit his new preferences. With this gone, he is stuck with the same Ronald, Veronica and Victor for the next eighteen years. ",
        "Summary_2": "The purpose of the Modifier is for the user to remove or change whatever type of companion they create. It is an essential part of the socialization experiment, and the manual recommends that finding it is a vital step. Since Manet\u2019s Master Chart is lost, he has no idea what the Modifier looks like and cannot locate it until the very end when Victor destroys it. The Modifier is what Manet needs to disable or change the companions he created, which would undo his dissatisfaction with them. To Victor, the purpose of the Modifier is an object that he must destroy as Manet\u2019s enemy. Since the Modifier is essentially the solution, Victor destroys it in an attempt to defeat Manet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Modifier is a part of the Socialization Kit that is described as its most vital element. However, it is indistinguishable from the rest of the kit, causing it to be unrecognizable. The Modifier is used to make amends to the people Manet creates from the kit, or to shut the people off altogether. In Manet's case, the Modifier would be helpful in solving his issues with both Manet and Veronica, and allow him to create new people that would appeal to him more. Without the Modifier, which Victor destroys at the end of the story, Manet is stuck with Ronald and Veronica indefinitely, unable to change them.",
        "Summary_4": "Modifier is vital for the socialization experiment and it is in the kit. It is needed to change or to turn off the created human copy, Ronald in this case. In the very end, it turns out to be one of the flesh-sprayers. With the modifier, Manet is the creator, he is in charge, he can do whatever he pleases with all those he has created. Without it he is powerless to change something or destroy the human copies. The modifier is vital because it is the key to the whole kit, the remote controller. "

        "Article": " \n  HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS\n  \n \n  By JIM HARMON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEST\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine October 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n  Every lonely man tries to make friends.\n   \n  Manet just didn't know when to stop!\n  \n \n \n  William Manet was alone.\n  \n \n  In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It would\ngive him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate\nloneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him\nto start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin\nteaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable\nlectures to a bored and captive audience of one.\n  \n \n  He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether\nit was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as\ndirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and\nthink more like a god than any man for generations.\n  \n \n  But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing\nbore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.\n  \n \n  Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already\ntalking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had\ncut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and\nwinked at it whenever he passed that way.\n  \n \n  Lately she was winking back at him.\n  \n \n  Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from\nhis arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.\n  \n \n  No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet\ncould only be this lonely on Mars.\n  \n \n  Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.\n  \n \n  All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle\nof the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat,\nflat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the\nblack sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons\nand one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole\ngimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was\nneeded here\u2014no human being, at least.\n  \n \n  The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't\ntake much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully\nspecified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb\nMars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.\n  \n \n  They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people\nfor the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to\nisolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet\nand his fellows.\n  \n \n  The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare\nto Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter\nservice for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations\nfor couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't\nproviding fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between\nthe various Overseers. They weren't very providential.\n  \n \n  But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered\nwonderful opportunities.\n  \n \n  It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making\na tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as\nbright as envy.\n  \n<doc-sep>Manet didn't open the box. He let it fade quietly in the filtered but\nstill brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall.\n  \n \n  Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper\ntaste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to\nhimself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.\n  \n \n  Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk,\nsuppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the\nconclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.\n  \n \n  So he went to open the box.\n  \n \n  The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It\ncrumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the\nboxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.\n  \n \n  The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old\nchemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and\nunremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to\nhave been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime.\n  \n \n  On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the\n   \n   Reader's\nDigest\n   \n  , covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in\nblack on the spine and cover:\n   \n   The Making of Friends\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title\nin larger print and slightly amplified:\n   \n   The Making of Friends and\nOthers\n   \n  . There was no author listed. A further line of information\nstated: \"A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.\" At the bottom of\nthe title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD.,\nSYRACUSE.\n  \n \n  The unnumbered first chapter was headed\n   \n   Your First Friend\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Before you go further, first find the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  in your kit. This\nis\n   \n   vital\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He quickly riffled through the pages.\n   \n   Other Friends, Authority, A\nCompanion\n   \n  .... Then\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  . Manet tried to flip past this\nsection, but the pages after the sheet labeled\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  were\nstuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in\nthe back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to\nthis section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.\n  \n \n  Manet flipped back to page one.\n  \n \n  First find the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  in your kit. This is\n   \n   vital\n   \n  to your entire\nexperiment in socialization. The\n   \n   Modifier is Part #A-1\n   \n  on the Master\nChart.\n  \n \n  He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There\nwas nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and\nlooked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its\noutside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits.\nMaybe even the\n   \n   Modifier\n   \n  itself.\n  \n \n  He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He\nstudied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand.\n  \n \n  The toe bone was connected to the foot bone....\n  \n \n \n \n  The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner.\n  \n \n  The Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration.\n  \n \n  The Red King crabbed sideways one square.\n  \n \n  The Black King pounced forward one space.\n  \n \n  The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy.\n  \n \n  The Black King shuffled sideways.\n  \n \n  The Red King followed....\n  \n \n  Uselessly.\n  \n \n  \"Tie game,\" Ronald said.\n  \n \n  \"Tie game,\" Manet said.\n  \n \n  \"Let's talk,\" Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.\n  \n \n  Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him.\nCheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in\norder to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible.\n  \n \n  \"The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars,\" Ronald said\npontifically.\n  \n \n  \"Only in the air,\" Manet corrected him.\n  \n \n  Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress.\nIntelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know\nany more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to\nthat when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder.\n  \n \n  \"There were no dogfights in Korea,\" Ronald said.\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the\nlast of which took place near the end of the First World War. The\naerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not\nseen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for\nsingle passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts,\nthat this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the\nleisurely combats of World War One.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to be\nwarm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Manet knew it all. He had heard it all before.\n  \n \n  He was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, Daniel\nBoone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines,\nthe painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing,\n   \n   ad nauseum\n   \n  . What a\nnarrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thought\nand concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginal\nhuman being?\n  \n \n  Of course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy.\n  \n \n  Manet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties\u2014Lt. \"Hoot\" Gibson,\nSam Merwin tennis stories,\n   \n   Saturday Evening Post\n   \n  covers\u2014when he had\nfirst learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firm\nopinions on all these.\n  \n \n  He yearned for someone to challenge him\u2014to say that\n   \n   Dime Sports\n   \n  had\nbeen nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why,\n   \n   Sewanee Review\n   \n  , there\nhad been a magazine for you.\n  \n \n  Manet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than his\nown. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superior\nto the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was a\nbetter band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk.\n  \n \n  \"Ronald,\" Manet said, \"you are a terrific jerk.\"\n  \n \n  Ronald leaped up immediately and led with his right.\n  \n \n  Manet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross.\n  \n \n  Ronald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel.\n  \n \n  The two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing the\ndiesel works, closed again.\n  \n \n  Ronald leaped forward and led with his right.\n  \n \n  Manet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge of\nRonald's jaw.\n  \n \n  Ronald pinwheeled to the floor.\n  \n \n  He lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth.\n\"Had enough?\" he asked Manet.\n  \n \n  Manet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Ronald hopped up lightly. \"Another checkers, Billy Boy?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer.\"\n  \n \n  Manet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury.\n  \n \n  Ronald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get in\na fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manet\nwanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid.\n  \n \n  Manet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard.\n  \n \n  But if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it that\ntheir checker games always ended in a tie?\n  \n<doc-sep>Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Hear that?\" he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth.\n  \n \n  \"No, darling.\"\n  \n \n  Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore\nthe noise. She was still following orders.\n  \n \n  \"Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald,\" the voice carried\nthrough sepulchrally.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Manet yelled.\n  \n \n  The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off.\n  \n \n  A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it.\n  \n \n  Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took\ncomfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the\nstation.\n  \n \n  Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch.\n  \n \n  Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His\nhands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips\nseemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the\nshouting but from having nothing to drink for some months.\n  \n \n  Ronald didn't say anything to Manet.\n  \n \n  But he looked offended.\n  \n \n  \"You,\" Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back,\n\"inside, inside.\"\n  \n \n  Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl.\n  \n \n  \"Do you know what I'm going to do with you?\" Manet demanded. \"I'm going\nto lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year,\nforever! Now what do you think about that?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you think it's the\n   \n   right\n   \n  thing, dear,\" Veronica said hesitantly.\n  \n \n  \"You know best, Willy,\" Ronald said uncertainly.\n  \n \n  Manet slammed the hatch in disgust.\n  \n \n  Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of\nhis reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk\ncarefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he\nwalked too carefully for this to happen.\n  \n \n  As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: \"In my opinion,\nWilliam, you should let us out.\"\n  \n \n  \"I,\" Veronica said, \"honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill,\ndearest.\"\n  \n \n  Manet giggled. \"What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you\nback after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?\"\n  \n \n  He went down the corridor, giggling.\n  \n \n  He giggled and thought: This will never do.\n  \n<doc-sep>Manet suspected hallucination, but in an existence with all the pallid\ndispassion of a requited love he was happy to welcome dementia.\nSometimes he even manufactured it. Sometimes he would run through the\narteries of the factory and play that it had suddenly gone mad hating\nhuman beings, and was about to close down its bulkheads on him as sure\nas the Engineers' Thumb and bale up the pressure-dehydrated digest,\nmaking so much stall flooring of him. He ran until he dropped with a\nkind of climaxing release of terror.\n  \n \n  So Manet put on the pressure suit he had been given because he would\nnever need it, and marched out to meet the visiting spaceship.\n  \n \n  He wasn't quite clear how he came from walking effortlessly across\nthe Martian plain that had all the distance-perpetuating qualities of\na kid's crank movie machine to the comfortable interior of a strange\ncabin. Not a ship's cabin but a Northwoods cabin.\n  \n \n  The black and orange Hallowe'en log charring in the slate stone\nfireplace seemed real. So did the lean man with the smiling mustache\npainted with the random designs of the fire, standing before the\nhorizontal pattern of chinked wall.\n  \n \n  \"Need a fresher?\" the host inquired.\n  \n \n  Manet's eyes wondered down to heavy water tumbler full of rich, amber\nwhiskey full of sparks from the hearth. He stirred himself in the\ncomfortingly warm leather chair. \"No, no, I'm\n   \n   fine\n   \n  .\" He let the word\nhang there for examination. \"Pardon me, but could you tell me just what\nplace this is?\"\n  \n \n  The host shrugged. It was the only word for it. \"Whatever place you\nchoose it to be, so long as you're with Trader Tom. 'Service,' that's\nmy motto. It is a way of life with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Trader Tom? Service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes! That's it exactly. It's\n   \n   me\n   \n  exactly. Trader Tom Service\u2014Serving\nthe Wants of the Spaceman Between the Stars. Of course, 'stars' is\npoetic. Any point of light in the sky in a star. We service the\nplanets.\"\n  \n \n  Manet took the tumbler in both hands and drank. It was good whiskey,\nimmensely powerful. \"The government wouldn't pay for somebody serving\nthe wants of spacemen,\" he exploded.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" Trader Tom said, cautionary. He moved nearer the fire and warmed\nhis hands and buttocks. \"Ah, but I am not a\n   \n   government\n   \n  service. I\nrepresent free enterprise.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The prospect\n   \n   was\n   \n  frightful.\n  \n \n  Victor smiled. \"Aren't you going to denounce me for a fiend?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, it is time for the denouncement. Tell me, you feel that now you\nare through? You have fulfilled your function?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see\nme suffer?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Yes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No. Can't do it, old man. Can't.\n   \n   I\n   \n  know. You're too human, too\nlike me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state\nof uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to be\nhappening to him. He has to be happening to something. You didn't kill\nme because then you would have nothing left to do. You'll never kill\nme.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not!\" Victor stormed. \"Fundamental safety cut-off!\"\n  \n \n  \"Rationalization. You don't\n   \n   want\n   \n  to kill me. And you can't stop\nchallenging me at every turn. That's your function.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop talking and just think about your miserable life,\" Victor said\nmeanly. \"Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't make\nany new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of your\nuselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's that\nfor boredom, for passiveness?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Manet said irritably, his social\nmanners rusty. \"I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your\npurpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every\nfoot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need a\nfriend!\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Dear Editor:\n  \n \n  These guys might be queer drunk hopheads. But if not? If soon brain\ndissolve, body fall apart, how long have we got? Please, anybody who\nknows answer, write to me\u2014Ivan Smernda, Plaza Ritz Arms\u2014how long is a\ngleeb?\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual\ndiligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the\nbox to go around.\n  \n \n  The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The\nModel Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.\n  \n \n  He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make\nany one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.\n  \n \n  He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from\nhim for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.\n  \n \n  Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.\n  \n \n  But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.\n  \n \n  Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did\nso, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.\n  \n \n  He glanced forward and found the headings:\n   \n   The Final Model\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid\na price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to\nthat? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he\ncould.\n  \n \n  He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of\nill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and\nunder his fingers....\n  \n \n  Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.\n  \n \n  Victor was finished. Perfect.\n  \n \n  Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.\n  \n \n  \"Move!\"\n  \n \n  Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the\nflesh-sprayers.\n  \n \n  As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized\nthat it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.\n  \n \n  \"It's finished!\" were Victor's first words. \"It's done!\"\n  \n \n  Manet stared at the tiny wreck. \"To say the least.\"\n  \n \n  Victor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should\nunderstand. I am different from the others.\"\n  \n \n  \"They all say that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am not your friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"No?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\"\n  \n \n  Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure\nat the symmetry of the situation.\n  \n \n  \"It completes the final course in socialization,\" Victor continued. \"I\nam your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have\n   \n   all\n   \n  your knowledge.\n   \n   You\n   \n  do not have all your knowledge. If you let\nyourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is\nmy function to use everything I possibly can against you.\"\n  \n \n  \"When do you start?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's so bad about that?\" Manet asked with some interest.\n  \n \n  \"You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never\nchange. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your\ninterest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll\nnever change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I've\nmade the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man.\n   \n   I've\nseen that you will always keep your friends.\n   \n  \"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When we first meet William Manet, he thinks it is inevitable that he will go insane, and even welcomes it. He would get \"fat and dirty\" and he would become animalistic and create a god complex for himself. He quickly slips into madness in his isolation, making notes for lectures to give to no one in particular, a picture of Annie Oakley, winking at him on more than one occasion. The idea of madness is also brought up in the illusive character of \"Trader Tom\". It is not clear whether he or his spaceship are real at all, when it is said that Manet \"Thinks\" he sees the ship one day. There is no definitive answer as to how he gets onto the ship, or who or what Trader Tom works for. When Manet finishes the glass of whiskey, it becomes instantly clean, like he had never drank from it. His ship is also very strange, with a fireplace in it. We can later see Manet's madness in his violent outbursts. We first see him beat up Ronald, and then Veronica. His madness is truly shown when he exclaims that he should have started beating women much sooner. It is unclear throughout the whole story whether any of this took place in the real world, or whether it was all in Manet's head. ",
        "Summary_2": "Manet\u2019s madness is portrayed in the story as his continuous creations of friends and treatment towards Victor. Instead of being satisfied with his ideal friend, he ends up creating three companions, all of whom he immensely dislikes after some time. Furthermore, when Victor tells him that he has trapped Manet with the three copies forever, the other man does not seem to be frightened or fazed. Manet only says that Victor is too human-like and that a man cannot accept being in a passive state. He also says that Victor will never kill him because it means that there will be nothing for him to do after. Even though Victor tries to insult his life, Manet\u2019s madness has prevented him from caring and only finds his presence as entertainment that will never make him bored. Manet\u2019s madness grows throughout the socialization experiment, and it becomes extremely apparent when the confrontation with Victor happens. ",
        "Summary_3": "Manet's madness starts out as an inevitable concept, which he is aware of himself when he takes the job as an Overseer. He anticipates going mad from loneliness and boredom, but the madness comes sooner than expected. He begins to talk to himself and interact with inanimate objects, such as the photo of Annie Oakley he keeps on his wall. Eventually, his madness progresses, which he embraces, such as how he pretends that the machine will destroy him from the inside. Manet then begins to question his own madness and its abilities to make him hallucinate, specifically when Trader Tom's ship lands in front of him. Later on in the story, Manet's madness is not from loneliness, but from rage and irritation, which is then manifested through violence taken out on Ronald and Veronica.",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts with Manet's curiosity as some sort of an experiment regarding how fast will he go crazy. He even desires this madness to come because he is bored and lonely, and this thoughts about madness keep him interested at least. He talks to himself and to a portrait, sometimes believing it talks back. When a ship arrives neither he nor the readers can be sure whether it is a hallucination or not. He starts believing in aliens and even when he thinks of the spaceship as a hallucination, he likes the thought of dementia in this loneliness, which is not a healthy thought, but rather a sign of madness.

Then, \"Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a\ngirl once? A Miss Arkady?\"\n  \n \n  Farquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.\n  \n \n  \"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n  \n \n  \"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\n  \n \n  Opperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier.

Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n  \n \n  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n  \n \n  \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n  \n \n  \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n  \n \n  \"The police\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's behind it?\"\n  \n \n  \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n  \n \n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n  \n \n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n  \n \n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n  \n \n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n  \n<doc-sep>Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and\npathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out\nin that miserable cold to meet him.\n  \n \n  The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not\ntoo clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than\nRossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n  \n \n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He\nwas about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the\nhovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man\nappeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.\n  \n \n  \"C'n I go now, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan turned and nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning,\nhe yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and\nput it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A\nmoment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.\n  \n \n  \"Was he\n   \n   drunk\n   \n  ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of\n   \n   liquor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the\nenvelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We\nhaven't much time.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As\nRossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but\ncould not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n  \n \n \n \n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape\nreality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.\n   \n \n \n  A BOTTLE OF\n   \n \n   Old Wine\n   \n \n \n  By Richard O.

Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\nof her first day's spying.\n  \n \n  No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\nwas set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\nPerhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\nhad her phone tapped.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n  \n \n  Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\nDo you read me? Over.\"\n  \n \n  Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n  \n \n  The room was empty.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n  \n \n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n  \n \n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n  \n \n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n  \n \n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n  \n \n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n  \n \n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n  \n \n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n  \n \n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Maitland, a militant engineer specialized in atomic rocket motors, awakes one night to a strange sound in his room. He blacks out and awakes again, this time in a room that isn't his. He takes in his surroundings and notices a prairie and a river outside his window, and within his room a door to exit which he cannot open. As Maitland wonders helplessly, a man by the name of Swarts enters his room. Swarts tells Maitland that he is here to participate in a series of psychological tests, assuring him that he is not interested in any secret intelligence related to his career. Swarts leads Maitland to his laboratory, where a cot stands in the center of the room under a ceiling of electric cables. Maitland resists initially, wary of the extent Swarts would go to in order for him to comply; however, Swarts manages to get Maitland onto the cot by force. He then reveals his main objective, which is figuring out why Maitland has a passion and longing to go to the Moon. Later that evening, Maitland meets a girl, later referred to as Ingrid Ching, who silently brings him a meal. He stares outside his window, trying to piece together where he could be, when he notices the presence of Venus in the sky as an evening star and comes to the realization that he has traveled to the future. Bewildered, Maitland is eager to learn more about the advancements of society, namely the status of man's trip to space. He asks Ching, who refuses to answer, and is then brought back to Swarts' lab. Maitland, determined to have his questions answered, rebels against Swarts' following tests through mental resistance. Becoming frustrated, Swarts tells Maitland that they are in the year A.D 2634, and that Ching would answer remaining questions if he complied with the tests. Agreeing, Ching visits Maitland that evening, and indulges him in the history of the human race up to this point, including stories of the Afrikanders, who dominated technological advancements and ruled the global empire, and how the world eventually transformed into one race. Maitland asks Ching whether humans have been able to go to space yet, and she is perplexed. She tells him that though she doesn't think it would be impossible, it has not been done, and she wonders why such a thing would be desired. Ching explains that the world is no longer in an age of technology, but an age of understanding humans and cultures within their world. Maitland is defeated; he cannot comprehend how there is no interest in traveling to space, realizing that his lifelong goal has become unattainable. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts with Maitland waking up from a loud thump but quickly goes back to sleep. Later he realizes that he is not in his room. This is not the Reservation. Then he remembers that something has happened during the night. He believes that whoever captures him must want information about the rocket motor. He gets up to inspect the room but only find a door leading to the bathroom. The other door cannot be opened and the view from the window is unfamiliar. About half an hour later, the other door opens and a man named Swarts explains that he will perform some psychological tests on Maitland for about a week and does not want any information regarding the rocket motor. Even though Swarts made it clear that he can obtain the results he want with or without Maitland\u2019s cooperation, Maitland still protests. He puts up a fight but ends up on the cot that will record his body changes. Swarts notes that the question regarding traveling to the moon seems to have created involuntary responses, and he wants to know why. \n\nBack at the cell, dinner is brought by an Oriental looking girl. Maitland watches the sunset and suddenly realizes that Venus was a morning star, but now he sees it after sunset. He becomes excited after learning that he has time travelled and is determined to ask Swarts which year he is in. He assumes that there are spaceports in the space to reach the starts. The next day Maitland asks the girl what year they\u2019re in, but she refuses to tell him. Swarts also refuses to tell him anything, thus he does not cooperate in the labs. Finally, Swarts yields and tells him that they are in A.D. 2634. He assures Maitland that the girl, Ingrid Ching, will answer his questions. Then Maitland cooperates. Later Maitland learns about the \u2018history\u2019 that has happened since his time. And he learns that they have no interest in going to outer space. Instead of the age of technology, they are in the age of man.   ",
        "Summary_3": "Maitland wakes up in his room in the residential section of the Reservation. He thinks he sees a man in the corner of his room, and just then, he is knocked unconscious. He awakens again the next morning, soon realising that he is not in his room anymore, and he is not in the Reservation either. He must have been abducted in the night and taken to this strange place that is steeped in beautiful nature. Through the window of his room he sees a man and a woman coming up a hill towards the building he is in. Half an hour later, the man he had seen earlier arrives in his room. He tells Maitland his name is Swarts. He isn't going to tell him where he is, and that even though Maitland works in the engineering of rocket motors, he has no interest in extracting secrets from his job. He will be performing a series of tests on Maitland. He takes him to his lab, where Maitland refuses to participate in Swarts' test, so Swarts beats him up and pins him down. He asks Maitland if he wants to go to the moon, then telling him that he wants to understand why. In the evening, a girl enters Maitland's room, bringing him dinner. He notices how beautiful she is. He wonders what this is all about. He watches the sun set, and the stars come out. He notices Venus in the sky, his favourite planet. He then realises that Venus was just a morning star, and it is now an evening star. He must've traveled into the future. Maitland is determined to get the truth about what year it is from Swarts. After great resistance to the tests that Swarts puts him through the next day, the man finally gives into Maitlands question, telling him it is the year 2634. He tells him that the girl who had brought him food, named Ingrid Ching, would answer any questions he might have. Maitland is overcome with excitement at the idea that he might find a place in this society, and be able to use their technology to travel in space. He is quickly brought down though when Ching tells him that there is no such thing as space travel, as the population of Earth, which is now only 300 million, have no interest in such a thing. She tells him a bit about the history of Earth since the 20th century and Maitland is devastated to learn that he will never realise his dream of traveling to space. ",
        "Summary_4": "Maitland wakes up in a strange room in an unexpected location. He thinks to himself where he might be and starts to feel scared and helpless because he is unsure. Suddenly, a man, Swarts, appears at the now opened entrance to his room. Swarts tells Maitland that he will be there for a week and be fed 3 meals a day. Swarts continues to say that he will not tell Maitland where he is and that the purpose of his stay is to undergo psychological tests. \n\nSwarts leads Maitland into the laboratory room tells Maitland to lie down on the surgical cot at the center of the room. The first test will be similar to a lie detector test. He warns Maitland that he should cooperate, but Maitland becomes purposefully defiant. Swarts then forces Maitland onto the cot and straps him into it. Maitland begins to think about what the tests might be as Swarts sets up the different instruments. Swarts then begins the experiment and asks Maitland to explain why he wants to go to the moon. Maitland is intrigued by the question as it was unexpected.\n\nAfter returning to his cell and eating the meal that Ching brought him, Maitland begins to think about the situation. After making some observations about the sky, Maitland realizes where he is. He notices that Venus is suddenly an evening star. He becomes full of excitement and thinks about all the possible implications. Energized by his new knowledge, he thinks of a plan to get Swarts to be more open with him and then goes to sleep. After conversing with Ching during his breakfast, Maitland waits in his room until Swarts walks in and then promptly asks Swarts the year. Swarts avoid answering the question and takes Maitland to the laboratory for more testing. \n\nMaitland tries to fight against the new machine hoping Swarts will answer his question and his efforts are successful. Swarts tells him that it is the year 2634, and Maitland responds with a grin. He agrees to cooperate with Swarts as long as Ching answers his questions after the experiments. Back in his cell, Ching tells Maitland a quick history of the world of the last 500 years. She explains the deadly war that occurred and the response to it. Maitland then excitedly asks about space innovation but Ching seems confused by the question. Ching asks Maitland why he or anyone else during his time wants to travel in space. Maitland finds it incredulous that with all of the technology at hand people have not traveled to space. Ching explains that her time is the Age of Man and as long as machines work, humans don\u2019t want to think about them, while Maitland\u2019s time is the Age of Technology. Maitland is very discouraged upon learning that in the present time there is not a familiar interest in space travel and asks to be alone in his room in reaction to the upsetting news. \n"

When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  AMBITION\n  \n \n  By WILLIAM L. BADE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by L. WOROMAY\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  To the men of the future, the scientific\n   \n  goals of today were as incomprehensible\n   \n  as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\n  \n \n \n  There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\n  \n<doc-sep>The youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n  \n \n  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n  \n \n  \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n  \n \n  \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n  \n \n  \"The police\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's behind it?\"\n  \n \n  \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n  \n \n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n  \n \n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n  \n \n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n  \n \n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The majority of the story takes place in the cell that Maitland is kept in by Swarts. The room is unconventional, according to Maitland, with no sharp edges, lines, or corners. Instead, the room is rounded, mostly made of smooth metal and plastic. There is no knob or latch on his door, and his window is made of a plastic so transparent it looks invisible. Because Maitland cannot leave his room, his observation of the outside is limited to what is through his window; the land outside is lush, with a rich prairie, an ocean, and a river. He has a view of the vast sky, and at night is able to see the stars. The other location that Maitland experiences in the story is Swarts' lab, which looks similar to an ordinary lab, with familiar electronics and machinery. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story first takes place in Maitland\u2019s room which has an open window at the side of his bed. Later when Maitland wakes up, he is not in his room anymore. This room is no straight lines or sharp corners; there are blue and featureless walls made from plastic, smooth doors made from metals, chair and table from aluminum alloy. Interestingly, the doors does not have any knob, but there is a button on the wall that controls one of the two doors. The door opens to the bathroom. The other one cannot be controlled from the inside. The window is made of strong transparent plastics. Outside the window, there are deep prairie grass and the ocean stretches to the horizon. Instead of the oxygen plant in the California desert, there is a river down the hill covered by huge ancient trees. Outside the other door is a laboratory which has a surgical cot and a bench at the side of the room. It supports a few electronics cabinets. There are cables from the ceiling, going to a focus above the cot. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in two time periods. The first setting of the story is in Maitland's room in the residential section of the reservation in 1950. He is then taken to the year 2634. In the room that he wakes up in, there is a palpable sense of uneasiness. There are no straight lines anywhere, and every surface is smooth. There are two doors in the room, one of which has a button beside it, when pressed leading to a bathroom. The other door has no way to open it from the inside. In Swarts' lab in the same building is a surgical cot, a bench, some screens, cables, pilot lights and switches. The outside of the building presents a beautiful, open landscape. There is a lawn directly outside the building which leads to a green ocean. Down a hill is a benign river, underneath a patch of huge trees. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Maitland waking up believing that he\u2019s in the residential section of the Reservation and then realizing that he\u2019s not. Where he is, he\u2019s not sure but he can see dark green pastoral grass and ocean stretching to the horizon. The room that he is in appears strange to him. He notes that it gives him access to a bathroom but not the ability to leave the room of his own volition. \n\nWhen a man enters Maitland\u2019s room, the man leads Maitland from his strange cell into a laboratory. The laboratory has a surgical cot at the center of the room with a bench on the wall that holds different electronics. Maitland is put on the cot and the experiment begins. \n\nOnce the experiment, is over, Maitland returns to his cell where he is given food and falls asleep for the night. \n\nAccording to Maitland he is from the 20th century but believes that he was brought into the future. His hypothesis is based upon that Venus is now an evening star when it was a morning star before he was brought to the facility. After asking Swarts to confirm his theory and being ignored, Maitland is brought back to the laboratory for more testing. After another finished day of testing, Maitland is brought to his cell where he talks with Ching and asks her questions about the current period of time. \n"

        "Article": "Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement.

Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned.

Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n  \n \n  They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned\noffensive.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. \"You know what the date is,\" he\nstated.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't. Not since yesterday.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Swarts said patiently, \"let's get going. We have a lot to\nget through this morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   know\n   \n  this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.\nVenus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an\nevening star.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that. Come.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the\nlaboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach\nthe instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started\nsaying a list of words\u2014doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction\ntest\u2014Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc\n  3\n  x dx\" in his head.\nIt was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent\ntracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts\nhad stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man\nstanding over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.\n  \n \n  \"We'll try another series of tests.\"\n  \n \n  It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He\nlowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks\nof a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at\nthe ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's\neyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.\n  \n \n  \"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can\nblink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down\nagainst the tension.\"\n  \n \n  He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears\u2014\n  \n \n  And then the show began.\n  \n \n  He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were\nfootsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,\nand outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a\ntwelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you\nwife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.\nThere was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless\npowder\u2014then blackness.\n  \n \n  With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to\nslow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test\u2014what was the\ncountermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them\ndeclared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.\n  \n \n  Now he was looking at a girl. She....\n  \n \n  Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.\n  \n \n  He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day\nafter school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had\nall the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no\nmore. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of\nSwarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this\nnew world.\n  \n \n  Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened\nagainst the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his\nforehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....\n  \n \n  The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.\nThere was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and\nswollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.\n  \n \n  The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his\neyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at\nhim for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was\nstarting to ache from the effort of blinking.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland's smile became a grin.\n  \n<doc-sep>In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid\naside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for\nseveral seconds.\n  \n \n  She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that\nglowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of\nblonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless\nblouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her\nbody, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what\nseemed to be white wool.\n  \n \n  She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like\nexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down\nself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.\n  \n \n \n \n  She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak\nbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed\ndoor for a minute after she was gone.\n  \n \n  Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded\ncarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his\nstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset\nand to think.\n  \n \n  There were three questions for which he required answers before he\ncould formulate any plan or policy.\n  \n \n  Where was he?\n  \n \n  Who was Swarts?\n  \n \n  What was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given?\n  \n \n  It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme\nfor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the\ncontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the\nappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been\nnothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from\nforeign intelligence officers.\n  \n \n  It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at\nthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to\nthink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there\nwas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be\ncultivated, not allowed to go to grass.\n  \n \n  This might be somewhere in Africa....\n  \n \n  He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued\nglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get\nhold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.\nAfter a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,\na backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,\nMaitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of\npeace and an undefinable longing.\n  \n \n  Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.\n  \n \n  Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the\nconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he\nhad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,\nits transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the\nhorizon, and loved it equally in its\n   \n   alter ego\n   \n  of morning star. Venus\nwas an old friend. An old friend....\n  \n \n  Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and\ndiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists\nclenched, forgetting to breathe.\n  \n \n  Last night Venus hadn't been there.\n  \n \n  Venus was a morning star just now....\n  \n \n \n   Just now!\n   \n \n \n  He realized the truth in that moment.\n  \n<doc-sep>For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had\nto think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for\nme. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw\nand ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a\nman, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n  \n \n  No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange\nplanet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see\nthat space exploration\n   \n   made\n   \n  a man a reckless fool by doing things on\none planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n  \n \n  The thought intruded itself:\n   \n   why\n   \n  hadn't I recognized this before I\nlet Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted\nhim dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and\nrecognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n  \n \n  I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very\nwell be true, but how did that help now?\n  \n \n  I had to\n   \n   think\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane\nreasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,\nthere were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have\nendless opinions to contend with.\n  \n \n  But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.\nThere was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to\nreach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten\nmiles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in\nspacesuits.\n  \n \n  But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n  \n \n  Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he\nwould be?\n  \n \n  How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable?\n  \n<doc-sep>About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the\nwall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and\nsandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood\nup and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he\nmade an unimpressive figure.\n  \n \n  The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed\nwere the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.\nThe dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from\nswimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.\n  \n \n  This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of\nhimself.\n  \n \n  Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head\nof a thinker, the body of a trained athlete\u2014an unusual combination.\n  \n \n  Impassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where\nyou are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but\notherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth\nto protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the\nguessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.\n  \n \n  \"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have\nthree meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to\nleave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in\nany way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that\nwe want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart\njumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I\nwant to give you some psychological tests....\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this\nmoment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll\nadmit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here\u2014but it\nseems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give\nyour tests to.\"\n  \n \n  Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now,\ncome with me.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Throughout the story, Maitland shows his passion and knowledge for space; it defines him as a character and helps him in figuring out certain aspects of his situation. Maitland's passion for space is first introduced when Swarts asks him about going to the Moon. Maitland is taken aback by this question, and Swarts knows that the idea is extremely important to him; in fact, Maitland's dream of going to the Moon is the whole reason why he is experiencing these tests. Later on, space is significant in helping Maitland come to a realization. As he stares out the window trying to gauge where in the world he is located, he notices that Venus, his favorite planet, is in the sky during the evening, when back at the Reservation, it was a morning star. Maitland's knowledge of constellations and planets leads him to realize that he must have traveled into the future. Once Maitland realizes this, his main question is about space travel, and whether humans have achieved it. Once he learns that it has not been attempted or achieved, Maitland's motivation is lost; space was the driving force in his life and career, and space travel not being possible left him hopeless.",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, Swarts asks Maitland a question regarding Moon and he wants to know why Maitland wants to travel to the Moon. Moreover, space and the stars in space helped Maitland realize that they are not in his time anymore. The morning star Venus has become an evening star. Understanding that the people in the future are capable of time travel, Maitland was sure that they are also space travelling. However, when he asks Ching about their interstellar flights, she gets confused. Apparently, there has not been any desire to go to other planets. Even when they have the technology, there is no interest in exploring the space. But they do like to go to the past, they consider this an adventure while space travel is not. ",
        "Summary_3": "Space is very significant in the story. Maitland is a man who wishes to one day travel to mars. Swarts asks him if he wants to go to the moon. The reasoning behind Swarts testing Maitland is in an effort to discover why someone from the 20th century would want to go to the moon at all. In the year 2634, they have no interest or need for space travel. Ching doesn't even know what Mars is. They have the capability to travel to space, but don't care to. Their population is only 300 million, meaning that they're not going to run out of resources or space on Earth. They also see no need to travel to space in the name of adventure, as they have time travel, which according to Ching, is the greatest adventure of all. Maitland is devastated to discover that he will not travel to space. He wants to see the sun as a smaller star on mars, he wants to walk on Venus, he wants to see the rings of Saturn from only 200,000 miles away.",
        "Summary_4": "Maitland works in the speciality of heat transfer in relation to its application to rocket motors. He has a great and undeniable interest in space. He is able to discern his real location in time using his knowledge of space and the solar system to understand that he is not in the same time as he was before being at the facility. \n\nSpace seems to be of relevance to Swarts and his psychological tests as during the first experiment Swarts tells Maitland that he was brought because of his interest in the moon. One of the first questions Swarts asks Maitland is for his reasoning of why he wants to go to the moon. So, it is clear that Swarts is interested in studying Maitland\u2019s passion and desire for space travel.\n\nWhen discussing with Ching the history and advances that the human race has made since his generation, he excitedly asks about what other planets have been visited and other general information on space travel. His question confuses Ching because she does not understand why he is interested in traveling to space. Maitland finds it incredulously that they have so much technology but have not traveled to space. It shows the dichotomy of their viewpoints because Maitland sees space travel as a solution to population control and as an interesting prospect because space invites and feeds an adventurous spirit. On the other hand, Ching and the rest of the world have no desire for space innovation or travel because it is unnecessary to further interaction with technology. \n"

        "Query": "Throughout the story \"AMBITION,\" how do Maitland and Ching's relationship develop?",
        "Article": "\"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said\na while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.\nIf you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"'\n  \n \n  \"Ching?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n  \n \n  That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you mean\u2014\" Maitland wrinkled his brow\u2014\"adapt to modern\nculture? Don't tell me\n   \n   you're\n   \n  from another time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head\nof a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much\nbehind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old\ntongue.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

As the door slid\naside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for\nseveral seconds.\n  \n \n  She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that\nglowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of\nblonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless\nblouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her\nbody, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what\nseemed to be white wool.\n  \n \n  She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like\nexpectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down\nself-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.\n  \n \n \n \n  She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak\nbillowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed\ndoor for a minute after she was gone.\n  \n \n  Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded\ncarrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his\nstomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset\nand to think.\n  \n \n  There were three questions for which he required answers before he\ncould formulate any plan or policy.\n  \n \n  Where was he?\n  \n \n  Who was Swarts?\n  \n \n  What was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given?\n  \n \n  It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme\nfor getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the\ncontrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the\nappearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been\nnothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from\nforeign intelligence officers.\n  \n \n  It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at\nthe Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to\nthink of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there\nwas unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be\ncultivated, not allowed to go to grass.\n  \n \n  This might be somewhere in Africa....\n  \n \n  He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued\nglow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get\nhold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.\nAfter a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,\na backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,\nMaitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of\npeace and an undefinable longing.\n  \n \n  Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.\n  \n \n  Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the\nconstellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he\nhad watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,\nits transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the\nhorizon, and loved it equally in its\n   \n   alter ego\n   \n  of morning star. Venus\nwas an old friend. An old friend....\n  \n \n  Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and\ndiffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists\nclenched, forgetting to breathe.\n  \n \n  Last night Venus hadn't been there.\n  \n \n  Venus was a morning star just now....\n  \n \n \n   Just now!\n   \n \n \n  He realized the truth in that moment.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather\ncommonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and\na bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple\nof them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal\ncomplement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran\nacross the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the\ncenter of the room.\n  \n \n  \"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,\n\"Understand one thing\u2014the more you cooperate, the easier things will\nbe for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results\nagainst your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make\nme.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\"\n  \n \n  Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an\nanswer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie\ndetector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I\ngive you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed\nmuscles. \"Make me.\"\n  \n \n  If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\"\nhe said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if\nyou'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland shook his head stubbornly.\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\"\n  \n \n  He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the\nsolar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.\nHe felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on\nthe cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across\nhis chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a\nclamp that held his head immovable.\n  \n \n \n \n  Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and\nto other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to\nthe skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung\nfrom the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around\nhis left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box\nclamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined\nthe others.\n  \n \n  So\u2014Maitland thought\u2014Swarts could record changes in his skin\npotential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of\nthe body to stimuli.\n  \n \n  The question was, what were the stimuli to be?\n  \n \n  \"Your name,\" said Swarts, \"is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four\nyears old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly\nas applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to\nquestion you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is\nMadison, Wisconsin....\"\n  \n \n  \"You seem to know everything about me,\" Maitland said defiantly,\nlooking up into the hanging forest of cabling. \"Why this recital?\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not know everything about you\u2014yet. And I'm testing the\nequipment, calibrating it to your reactions.\" He went on, \"Your\nfavorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science\nfiction. Maitland,\n   \n   how would you like to go to the Moon\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and\nhe tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. \"What do\nyou mean?\"\n  \n \n  Swarts was chuckling. \"I really hit a semantic push-button there,\ndidn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants\nto go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out\n   \n   why\n   \n  .\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Opperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. \"You're a strong and\nvital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires.\" His voice\ntrailed off for a bit. Then, \"Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a\ngirl once? A Miss Arkady?\"\n  \n \n  Farquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.\n  \n \n  \"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n  \n \n  \"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\n  \n \n  Opperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an\nacademician, cushioned by tradition.\"\n  \n \n  Willard snorted. \"Science had already entered the era of the police\ninspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling\nenterprise.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps,\" Opperly agreed. \"Still, the scientist lived the safe,\nrestricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't\nexposed to the temptations of the world.\"\n  \n \n  Farquar turned on him. \"Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow\nbe able to buy me off?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not exactly.\"\n  \n \n  \"You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?\" Farquar demanded\nangrily.\n  \n \n  Opperly shrugged his helplessness. \"No, I don't think you'll change\nyour aims.\"\n  \n \n  Clouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight\nbetween the two men.\n  \n<doc-sep>Scornfully she turned and looked toward the western twilight. It was\nRoddie's turn to stand and stare.\n  \n \n  \"Purpose!\" Ida flung at him over her shoulder. \"Logic! Women hear so\nmuch of that from men! You're a man, all right! Men\n   \n   always\n   \n  call it\nlogic when they want to destroy! Loyalty to your own sort, kindness,\naffection\u2014all emotional, aren't they? Not a bit logical. Emotion is\nfor creating, and it's so much more logical to destroy, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  She whirled back toward him, advancing as if she wanted to sink her\nteeth into his throat. \"Go ahead. Get it over with\u2014if you have the\ncourage.\"\n  \n \n  It was hard for Roddie to look away from that wrath-crimsoned face,\nbut it was even harder to keep staring into the blaze of her eyes. He\ncompromised by gazing out an opening at the gathering dusk. He thought\nfor a long time before he decided to tuck his hammer away.\n  \n \n  \"It isn't reasonable to kill you now,\" he said. \"Too dark. You can't\npossibly get down that half-ruined manway tonight, so let's see how I\nfeel in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  Ida began to weep again, and Roddie found it necessary to comfort her.\n  \n \n  And by morning he knew he was a Man.\n  \n \n",

When Swarts started\nsaying a list of words\u2014doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction\ntest\u2014Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc\n  3\n  x dx\" in his head.\nIt was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent\ntracing back of steps.

He opened his eyes to find the other man\nstanding over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.\n  \n \n  \"We'll try another series of tests.\"\n  \n \n  It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He\nlowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks\nof a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at\nthe ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's\neyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.\n  \n \n  \"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can\nblink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down\nagainst the tension.\"\n  \n \n  He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears\u2014\n  \n \n  And then the show began.\n  \n \n  He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were\nfootsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,\nand outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a\ntwelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you\nwife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.\nThere was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless\npowder\u2014then blackness.\n  \n \n  With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to\nslow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test\u2014what was the\ncountermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them\ndeclared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.\n  \n \n  Now he was looking at a girl. She....\n  \n \n  Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.\n  \n \n  He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day\nafter school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had\nall the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no\nmore. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of\nSwarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this\nnew world.\n  \n \n  Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened\nagainst the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his\nforehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....\n  \n \n  The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.\nThere was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and\nswollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.\n  \n \n  The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his\neyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at\nhim for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was\nstarting to ache from the effort of blinking.\n  \n \n  \"What year is this?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland's smile became a grin.\n  \n<doc-sep>Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\n   \n   future\n   \n  ! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n  \n \n  And\n   \n   he\n   \n  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n  \n \n  \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n  \n \n \n   If\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said\na while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.\nIf you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"'\n  \n \n  \"Ching?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector\nto his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n  \n \n  That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit\nand watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes\nwhistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering\none leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme\nover and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant\nmounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth\nSymphony.\n  \n \n  He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself\naboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis\nMajor; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.\nIn his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright\nglobe against the constellations....\n  \n \n  Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray\nof food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and\nrevealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n  \n \n  \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you\nwant, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little\nof what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th\nCentury. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She\nlaughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so\nirritated as he was this noon.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.\nEagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?\nBelieve me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a\nlot better.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of\nTechnology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,\nI think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more\nexciting....\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you mean\u2014\" Maitland wrinkled his brow\u2014\"adapt to modern\nculture? Don't tell me\n   \n   you're\n   \n  from another time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head\nof a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much\nbehind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old\ntongue.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n  \n \n  His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n  \n \n  \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So many? How?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n  \n \n  \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the\nwall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and\nsandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood\nup and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he\nmade an unimpressive figure.\n  \n \n  The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed\nwere the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.\nThe dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from\nswimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.\n  \n \n  This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of\nhimself.\n  \n \n  Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head\nof a thinker, the body of a trained athlete\u2014an unusual combination.\n  \n \n  Impassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where\nyou are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but\notherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth\nto protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the\nguessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.\n  \n \n  \"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have\nthree meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to\nleave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in\nany way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that\nwe want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart\njumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I\nwant to give you some psychological tests....\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this\nmoment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll\nadmit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here\u2014but it\nseems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give\nyour tests to.\"\n  \n \n  Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now,\ncome with me.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  SURVIVAL\n   \n  TACTICS\n  \n \n  By AL SEVCIK\n  \n \n  ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK\n  \n \n \n   The robots were built to serve\nMan; to do his work, see to his\ncomforts, make smooth his way.\nThen the robots figured out an\nadditional service\u2014putting Man\nout of his misery.\n   \n \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Swarts uses different technology for his various tests. In the first, he uses electrodes and cables placed in various spots on Maitland's body, meant to record how Maitland responds and reacts to various stimuli. These include heart monitors, blood pressure recorders, and measurements of brain activity. Swarts uses similar technology in the next test to record Maitland's reactions, with a few additions. Firstly, he introduces gadgets attached to Maitland's eyelashes that keep him from closing his eyes. He also attaches lenses and a projector to Maitland's eyes to display different scenes to him.",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, Swarts or his men probably used some kinds of gadgets and brought Maitland from the heavily guarded Reservation. At the lab, Swarts tells Maitland to lay on the surgical cot, where cables run from the ceiling to the focus above the cot in the center of the room. When Maitland refuses to corporate, Swarts uses his fist to hit Maitland\u2019s solar plexus and put him onto the cot, where he is forced to remain still. The tiny electrodes are placed at his temples and other parts of his body, minute microphone placed on the skin over his heart, and a sphygmomanometer on his arm. Those gadgets are used to record his involuntary responses. When Maitland realizes that he is in the future, he refuses to corporate. Then, Swarts places two cylindrical tubes over Maitland\u2019s head, there are lenses at the end of the tubes. The tiny clamps on Maitland\u2019s eyelashes prevent his eyelids from closing for a long time. Earphones are placed in his ears. A video is played through the lenses. ",
        "Summary_3": "Swarts uses many different gadgets throughout the story. Along the wall of Swarts' laboratory are several electronic cabinets holding cathode ray tube screens. He uses a lie detector on Maitland made up of a multitude of tiny electrodes and a sphygmomanometer sleeve. He then uses an apparatus which he lowers over Maitland's head, with two cylindrical tubes with lenses at the end, and clamps to keep his eyelids open. It has a screen inside that projects videos. ",
        "Summary_4": "The first machine used by Swarts on Maitland when conducting the psychological tests is similar to a lie detector. The machine is meant to record Maitland\u2019s reactions to the different tests that he is given. It operates by attaching electrodes to Maitland\u2019s temples and other parts of his body and then putting a tiny microphone on his skin near his heart. In addition, a sphygmomanometer sleeve is wrapped around one of his arms. The different instruments on this machine are used to record the changes in Maitland\u2019s skin potential, blood pressure, and heartbeat. Thus, it measures his natural reaction to the stimuli he will be exposed to during the tests. \n\nThe next time he is tested, it is a new machine that has two cylindrical tubes similar to a binocular microscope that is placed over his head. Tiny clamps are attached to his eyelashes to keep his eyes from shutting. Earphones are also used to further the immersive experience of the new test. The new machine shows Maitland different clips, some disturbing, to gauge his various reactions. \n"

        "Query": "What is the story of Morgue Ship about?",
        "Article": "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n  \n \n  \"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\n  \n \n  Peterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n  \n \n  \"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\n   \n   might\n   \n  be able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\n  \n \n  The nurse came out of the door.\n  \n \n  \"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n  \n \n  \"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eight days, in\n   \n   that\n   \n  ship.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n  \n \n  \"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n  \n \n  \"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\n  \n \n  She didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\n  \n \n  Peterson opened his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\n  \n \n  Patti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\n  \n \n  Roberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n  \n \n  \"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\n  \n \n  The Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n  \n \n  \"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n  \n \n  \"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\n  \n \n  Abruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n  \n \n  \"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\n  \n \n  Roberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\n  \n<doc-sep>Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\nretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\nmouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\nthroats, shoot them or bury them alive?

It blotted out the far wall of\nthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,\nkeeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical\ngown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all\ntight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.\nOpening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor\nwarrior's body out of the void.\n  \n \n  He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and\nforth from Earth to nowhere.

Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred\nother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n  \n \n  Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots\ninside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the\nhusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved\nfor action.\n  \n \n  This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n  \n \n  \"Sam!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett jerked.

Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to\nlife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n  \n \n  \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was\nworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred\nthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood\ncooling in it.\n  \n<doc-sep>The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\n  \n \n  The ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\n   \n   Emergency. Battle posts.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\n  \n \n  The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\n  \n \n  This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\n  \n \n  The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n  \n \n  \"Fire number seven.\"\n  \n \n  He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\n  \n \n  This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\n  \n \n  He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\n  \n \n  The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n  \n \n  \"Hold fire.\"\n  \n \n  He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Stand by.\"\n  \n \n  Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\n  \n \n  This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n  \n \n  \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\n  \n \n  Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\n  \n \n  He poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\n  \n \n  He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\n  \n \n  A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n  \n \n  \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\n  \n \n  Shano blinked.\n  \n \n  Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n \n \n   \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\n   \n \n \n \n  He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\n  \n \n  Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\n  \n \n  He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname. Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rebellion?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n  \n \n  They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  complex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n  \n \n  \"And what?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n  \n \n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n  \n \n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n  \n \n  The old man was dead.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Sam Burnett hears the familiar sounds that indicate another dead body has been retrieved and collected onto the Morgue ship where he works. Burnett is a coroner that works to retrieve dead bodies from space lost in war and bring them back to Earth. He thinks of how his job has emotionally drained him. Rice interrupts his thoughts and yells for Sam to meet with him. Sam climbs up to the control room of the rocket. When he meets Rice, he realizes that the recovered body is an enemy official. Sam is suspicious of the condition of the body when Rice excitedly exclaims that it is the body of Lethla, Kriere\u2019s majordomo. Burnett is indifferent to the revelation. Yet, Rice is excited for the possibility of a high enemy official being dead and the possibility of the war coming to an end; Sam is still jaded. \n\nLethla moves and they realize that he is not dead.  Lethla was able to survive in the void of space with the usage of a well-hidden face mask made of glassite. Lethla threatens the two to not make any moves and communicates his intent to control the ship. Rice tells Lethla to leave because it is against Interplanetary law to mess with a morgue ship. Lethla rebuffs that defense. All the while, Sam is observing the two interact. Lethla lets the two know that Kriere is still alive and is also wearing the same mask that Lethla had worn. He explains that they were attacked near Mars while they were on their way to Venus. They were running out of supplies and decided to trick the morgue ship to continue their trip to Venus. After Lethla explains why and how he got to the morgue ship, he commands them to go pick up Kriere. Sam smiles and complies with Lethla\u2019s orders. \n\nSam thinks over his options and considers getting Lethla and Kriere to Venus so that he can peacefully return to Earth. They spot Kriere in space floating as if he is dead. Sam continues thinking about his options to overpower both Kriere and Lethla and experiences some fear over the possible success of his plan. He begins to sweat nervously but becomes more confident as he puts the plan into action. Sam activates the ship\u2019s claw mechanism to pick up Kriere\u2019s body. As Lethla watches him he mentions a saying about how the ship is meant for dead men and then unexpectedly begins to crush Kriere\u2019s body with the claw, killing Kriere. Lethla is caught off guard but manages to fire his gun at Sam before Rice attacks him. Lethla screams in horror for a time while Burnett uncontrollably laughs. Rice expresses how he doesn\u2019t believe Sam should have killed Kriere. Sam argues that it didn\u2019t matter as long as it was his last trip somehow. Sam dies and becomes the 100 body on the ship, filling it and allowing the ship to return back to Earth fulfilling Sam\u2019s last desire. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Sam Burnett works on the morgue ship called the Constellation. His job involves collecting bodies floating in the void, and he desperately wants to quit after ten long years. He works alongside Rice on the morgue ship. Burnett declares that this mission will be his last, or he will find a reason for it. He is wary about the nature of his job since it is so involved with death. Rice calls him over and explains that the body they just brought in is Lethla, Kriere\u2019s majordomo. Burnett is not very interested, but Rice takes this as a sign that Kriere must be somewhere near too. Rice talks about radioing for help if there is a warship, but Burnett does not care because he is tired of seeing all these bodies. Just before they can continue arguing, it turns out that Lethla is actually alive and reveals that he survived through the use of a face-moulded mask of glassite. Lethla knows they are weaponless and finds the radio, which upsets Rice because only dead men are supposed to be on their ship. Lethla reveals that Kriere is out there too, and he plans to use the morgue ship to rescue him. Rice does not move, but Burnett agrees to the request and goes up to drive the ship. He ponders his plan, thinking how cooperating with Venusians will help him and Rice survive. He also thinks about capturing Kriere and ending the war. They find Kriere floating in space, and Burnett drives the ship up to him. However, he knows that with both Lethla and Kriere on board, they have no chance of overpowering them. Burnett tells Rice to take the controls as he moves to the star-port, and he begins to feel the spot on his back where a bullet will hit him. Kriere is outside, reaching towards the Constellation and smiling. The claw lever is extended and retrieves Kriere, while Burnett tells Lethla that only dead men come aboard the ship. The claw crushes Kriere, leaving only his head preserved for identification. Lethla fires the gun that hits Burnett, but he and Rice retaliate. Soon, Lethla is dead too. Rice tells him that he shouldn\u2019t have done it, but Burnett tells him that he is determined to make this his last trip. He asks Rice if he is one hell of a patriot and dies shortly after. Rice softly declares that Burnett\u2019s body is one-hundred. ",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Burnett and his partner, Rice, are aboard the morgue ship Constellation with the goal of retrieving one hundred bodies from space before returning to Earth. They have been working for ten years, and Burnett has become frustrated with the job. He is sick of the repetition and dealing with dead bodies every day, and it has caused him to lose motivation in the war and returning home. The two are at their ninety-seventh body, only needing three more before being able to go home. One day, Burnett and Rice collect a soldier from the void, who they identify as Lethla, the right hand man of Kriere, the head enemy. Rice is excited, noting that Lethla's death indicates an end to the war, but Burnett remains unfazed, when Lethla's body suddenly jumps to life. Lethla had faked his death after an accident in order to board the morgue ship, and he takes Burnett and Rice hostage in an effort to rescue Kriere and go to Venus. Burnett agrees while Rice hesitates; he sees this as an opportunity to catch up with the war and end the trip once and for all. The Constellation reaches Kriere, and Burnett catches Lethla off guard by crushing Kriere with the claw, killing him. Burnett and Rice then fight off Lethla, eventually killing him too. Rice reprimands Burnett, noting that their cargo is not full and is still missing a body. Burnett, still lying down, watches Rice without protest, and Rice kills him for the final body.",
        "Summary_4": "Three new dead bodies lie before Sam Burnett aboard the Constellation. They add up to a hundred dead warriors aboard,  part of a much greater amount the crew picked up in ten years. Now, the spaceship is going back to Earth to bury them properly, with only two living people making up its crew - Rice and Sam. Sam suddenly starts feeling bad about his job, about all the similar dead bodies, tired of his job. Soon, a new body appears which looks different - \"too dead\". Turns out the dead is Lethla, Kriere's majordomo, signifying the war is somewhere near to the ship with more bodies. Sam and Rice have a short argument then: Rice wants to take advantage of Kriere, the enemy's leader, being on their territory. Sam argues that they should stay away as they are not a battle-cruiser, he is tired of his job, sentimental about the young warriors and willing to go back to Earth. The dispute stops when it turns out that Lethla is alive and aims his gun. Rice is shocked - no one can live in the void, but Lethla did with the help of glassite. The intruder breaks the radio and announces the purpose of his visit: to rescue Kriere. Turns out their ship was attacked and the two escaped in the same life- boat, wearing chrysali-helmets, and headed towards the morgue ship, the only thing nearby, knowing they would be taken in and considered dead. The morgue rocket was the best cover possible to get safely to Venus, but Kriere was still in the void, while Lethla was picked up. \"Constellation\" starts searching for Kriere as Lethla orders with Sam feeling finally alive and happily agreeing. He has a plan for the two to fill the empty shelves in his morgue. Various plans on how to kill the two enemies and end the war keep appearing in Sam's head while he picks up the body. As in slow-motion, the claw picking up the bodies crushes Kriere and Sam is shot by Lethla. Rice beats the least and rushes to Sam, who is happy to stop the war and save many more young warriors at any price. Sam's last though is that he is number one-hundred in this morgue filling an empty shelf.  "

Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.\nRice grumbled and cursed after him.\n  \n \n  On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like\na white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never\nknew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number\nninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n  \n \n  There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And\nwhat more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he\nchewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo\nwouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you\nnever knew who it would be.\n  \n \n  He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over\nthe hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that\nwas one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.\nChronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a\nslow pace.\n  \n \n  Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?\nSee him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be\nhard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out\nalive; if they cooperated.\n  \n \n  But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves\nin the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were\nstirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored.\n  \n \n \n   You may never catch up with the war again.\n   \n \n \n  The last trip!\n  \n \n  Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what\nridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n  \n \n  Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his\nbody vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,\nwet thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n  \n \n  Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n  \n \n  He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies\nbeing ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of\nhating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it\nwould all be over.\n  \n \n  Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like\nfluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,\nhe squinted.\n  \n \n  \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good\ntrick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all\naround Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There\nwas blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the\nhead, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n  \n \n  That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n  \n \n  Burnett spun about and leaped.\n  \n \n  The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n  \n \n  Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot\nramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back\nlike a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n  \n \n  Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and\nscreaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the\nroom swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and\nstarted laughing.\n  \n \n  He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever\nclaws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n  \n \n  Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's\nyoung face over him. Burnett groaned.\n  \n \n  Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.\nSomething wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last\ntrip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never\nhave to come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  , though, Rice.\" His voice\ntrailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll\nbe next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his\nmouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of\nthem out:\n  \n \n  \"Rice?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling\nthe shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is\nLethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling\nthis rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who\nwant to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back\nany way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen\nwarriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and\nBurnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a\nmillion miles.\n  \n \n  \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n  \n \n  Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to\ndissolve.\n  \n \n  Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n  \n \n  He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing\nout and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,\nthick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf\nat the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n  \n \n  And then he said softly:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   One hundred.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.\nRed and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy\nofficial. \"Take a look at this!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong\nwith the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it\nwas.\n  \n \n  Maybe it was because the body looked a little\n   \n   too\n   \n  dead.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,\nstood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as\ndelicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly\nblue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed\nclose to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a\ncluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed\ncompletely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n  \n \n  Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and\nblack. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n  \n \n  Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n  \n \n  \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n  \n \n  Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That\nright?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in\nspace, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.\nWhat the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone\nelse.\n  \n \n  Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!\nKriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That\nmeans Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n  \n \n  Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.\n\"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the\nVenus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the\nday you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick\nof it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling\nthrough the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good\ngreen Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n  \n \n  \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution\nis taken to protect that one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n  \n \n  \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a\nbattle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll radio for help?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred\nthousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has\nswept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n  \n \n  Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw\nhard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His\nfingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,\n\"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's\nbarrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and\ndays and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads\nbloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who\nstart out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.\nHe stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,\nhearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own\nheart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n  \n \n  \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't\ncare much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?\nLethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine\nbeside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n  \n \n  Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n  \n \n  Lethla was alive.\n  \n \n  He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.\nHe didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the\nnecessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what\nlanguage it would use if it had to.\n  \n \n  Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he\nknew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a\npale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it\nlike a dead cold star.\n  \n \n  Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From\nthe corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,\nbiting lines into his sharp face.\n  \n \n  Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.\n\"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n  \n \n  A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head.\n   \n   You\nnever catch up with the war!\n   \n \n \n  But what if the war catches up with you?\n  \n \n  What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?\n  \n<doc-sep>Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,\neyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n  \n \n  \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to\nLethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last\ntime anybody would ever board the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  alive. His stomach\nwent flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n  \n \n  If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end\nof shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind\nsearching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like\na smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,\nwater-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy\njet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be\neliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored\nbecause of his gun.\n  \n \n  Kriere would make odds impossible.\n  \n \n  Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n  \n \n  Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,\nfooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n  \n \n  Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade\nwhere Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,\nartery\u2014heart.\n  \n \n  There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and\nthis would be the last trip.\n  \n \n  Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n  \n \n  \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there\nwas too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in\nthe center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the\nstar-port.\"\n  \n \n  Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.\nBurnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back\nkept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet\nsings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,\nwhy\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of\nstars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about\nto be rescued.\n  \n \n  Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he\nwas about to end a ten-years' war.\n  \n \n  There was only\n   \n   one\n   \n  way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be\nfast.\n  \n \n  Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as\nit had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a\ngood sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered\ndirections, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies\nfrom space.\n  \n \n  Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,\ntoo.\n  \n \n  The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its\nslowness.\n  \n \n  It reached Kriere.\n  \n \n  Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n  \n \n  The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lethla watched.\n  \n \n  He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You\nknow, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . I believe it.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname. Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n",

        "Summary_4": "Sam Burnett is one of the two crew members aboard Constellation. For the last ten years he has been traveling in this morgue ship, picking up dead bodies in between Venus and Earth. He moves the ship, stops it at the sight of bodies, picks them up with the ship's extending claw, puts them on the table and inspects, then stocks them on the shelves to take back to Earth when the space is filled and give them a proper burial. The two planets are at war at the moment, so there are plenty of bodies in the void, coming from the crashed ships. Sam also does surgery and helps the bodies preserve. "

        "Query": "How does the protagonist of Morgue Ship, Sam Burnett, feel about his job of returning dead bodies to Earth?",
        "Article": "  Morgue Ship\n  \n \n  By RAY BRADBURY\n  \n \n  This was Burnett's last trip. Three more\n   \n  shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n   \n  he would be among the living again.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws\ngroping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n  \n \n  There was another dead man aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and\nquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;\nmachines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see\nanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of\nthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,\nkeeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical\ngown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all\ntight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.\nOpening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor\nwarrior's body out of the void.\n  \n \n  He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and\nforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back\nfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,\nwho just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a\ndecent burial.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice\nfrom the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,\nninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight\nsurgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded\ndeep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n  \n \n  Rice said:\n  \n \n  \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day\ndrunk!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them\ninto a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and\nshoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one\nanother in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,\nsalvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n  \n \n  Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred\nother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n  \n \n  Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots\ninside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the\nhusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved\nfor action.\n  \n \n  This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n  \n \n  \"Sam!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative\nlab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator\nshelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to\nlife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n  \n \n  \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was\nworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred\nthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood\ncooling in it.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.\nRed and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy\nofficial. \"Take a look at this!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong\nwith the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it\nwas.\n  \n \n  Maybe it was because the body looked a little\n   \n   too\n   \n  dead.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,\nstood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as\ndelicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly\nblue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed\nclose to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a\ncluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed\ncompletely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n  \n \n  Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and\nblack. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n  \n \n  Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n  \n \n  \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n  \n \n  Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That\nright?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in\nspace, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.\nWhat the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone\nelse.\n  \n \n  Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think!\nKriere\u2014The All-Mighty\u2014in our territory. His right hand man dead. That\nmeans Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n  \n \n  Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.\n\"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the\nVenus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the\nday you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick\nof it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling\nthrough the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good\ngreen Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n  \n \n  \"As for Kriere\u2014if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution\nis taken to protect that one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n  \n \n  \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a\nbattle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll radio for help?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred\nthousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has\nswept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n  \n \n  Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw\nhard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His\nfingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,\n\"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's\nbarrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and\ndays and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads\nbloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who\nstart out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.\nHe stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,\nhearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own\nheart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n  \n \n  \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't\ncare much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here\u2014what's his name?\nLethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine\nbeside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n  \n \n  Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n  \n \n  Lethla was alive.\n  \n \n  He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.\nHe didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the\nnecessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what\nlanguage it would use if it had to.\n  \n \n  Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he\nknew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a\npale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it\nlike a dead cold star.\n  \n \n  Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From\nthe corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,\nbiting lines into his sharp face.\n  \n \n  Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.\n\"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n  \n \n  A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head.\n   \n   You\nnever catch up with the war!\n   \n \n \n  But what if the war catches up with you?\n  \n \n  What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?\n  \n<doc-sep>Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time\nin years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n  \n \n  \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n  \n \n  Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on\nboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n  \n \n  Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n  \n \n  Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.\nRice grumbled and cursed after him.\n  \n \n  On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like\na white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never\nknew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number\nninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n  \n \n  There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And\nwhat more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he\nchewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo\nwouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you\nnever knew who it would be.\n  \n \n  He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over\nthe hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that\nwas one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.\nChronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a\nslow pace.\n  \n \n  Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?\nSee him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be\nhard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out\nalive; if they cooperated.\n  \n \n  But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves\nin the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were\nstirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored.\n  \n \n \n   You may never catch up with the war again.\n   \n \n \n  The last trip!\n  \n \n  Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what\nridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n  \n \n  Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his\nbody vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,\nwet thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n  \n \n  Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n  \n \n  He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies\nbeing ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of\nhating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it\nwould all be over.\n  \n \n  Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like\nfluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,\nhe squinted.\n  \n \n  \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good\ntrick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all\naround Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There\nwas blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the\nhead, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n  \n \n  That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n  \n \n  Burnett spun about and leaped.\n  \n \n  The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n  \n \n  Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot\nramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back\nlike a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n  \n \n  Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and\nscreaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the\nroom swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and\nstarted laughing.\n  \n \n  He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever\nclaws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n  \n \n  Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's\nyoung face over him. Burnett groaned.\n  \n \n  Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.\nSomething wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last\ntrip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the hard way\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never\nhave to come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  , though, Rice.\" His voice\ntrailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll\nbe next. Who'd have thought, four days ago\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his\nmouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of\nthem out:\n  \n \n  \"Rice?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling\nthe shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there\u2014number ninety-eight is\nLethla\u2014number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling\nthis rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who\nwant to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back\nany way\u2014but\u2014the way\u2014we used to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen\nwarriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and\nBurnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a\nmillion miles.\n  \n \n  \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n  \n \n  Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to\ndissolve.\n  \n \n  Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n  \n \n  He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing\nout and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,\nthick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf\nat the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n  \n \n  And then he said softly:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   One hundred.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>  ACID BATH\n  \n \n  By VASELEOS GARSON\n  \n \n \n \n    The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments\nin his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid.

        "Summary_1": "Sam Burnett is very jaded by his job. He has spent years returning dead bodies to Earth, lost in a seemingly endless war. He suggests that he began the job with less of a sullen view, but that opinion is forever lost. He no longer has the emotional capacity to acknowledge the individual lives of each lost warrior. Sam feels as if his job is rotting him from the inside and starving him from real life and action. He has no energy or excitement in his actions anymore because of his job causing him to complete it in an almost mechanical way. He becomes numb to the bodies; seeing them and preparing them to be stored is just a regular part of his routine. All Sam wants to do is return back to Earth, dead or alive. ",

Burnett is starved for action, as his only company are the dead soldiers who can no longer speak and Rice. Although he has built up a mental defense by doing his job with mechanical hands, he still has emotions that haunt him. When Rice asks him about Lethla, he has no interest and grows instantly tired. However, Burnett is determined to get out of this job one way or another. This is what motivates him to act out against Lethla and Kriere, even though they are two highly dangerous and important Venusian figures. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Burnett despises his job, noting several times throughout the story that he is eager to end his last trip. Working in a morgue is morbid enough, but being stuck in a ship for ten years has added to it. Burnett no longer sees motivation for much anymore, becoming desensitized to seeing dead body after dead body. He no longer holds excitement about the war because he can only witness its aftermath. Burnett's feelings towards his job are expressed when he blows up at Rice, claiming that he wouldn't care if he returned to Earth as one of the dead bodies on their shelves. ",
        "Summary_4": "Sam Burnett is tired of his job - it's monotonous and all the bodies seem the same to him. He is also sympathetic to the young warriors being dead.

He used to be a 'machine' and do his job automatically, but he broke, now he can't handle those corpses. He doesn't feel alive as well, Lethra's arrival, the possibility to end the war, spark life in Sam, they bring some action in.

Three more\n   \n  shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n   \n  he would be among the living again.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws\ngroping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n  \n \n  There was another dead man aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and\nquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;\nmachines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see\nanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of\nthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,\nkeeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical\ngown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all\ntight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.\nOpening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor\nwarrior's body out of the void.\n  \n \n  He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and\nforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back\nfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,\nwho just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a\ndecent burial.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice\nfrom the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,\nninety-six and ninety-seven now.

Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred\nother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n  \n \n  Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots\ninside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the\nhusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved\nfor action.\n  \n \n  This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n  \n \n  \"Sam!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative\nlab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator\nshelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to\nlife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n  \n \n  \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was\nworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred\nthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood\ncooling in it.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n  \n \n  \"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\n  \n \n  Peterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n  \n \n  \"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\n   \n   might\n   \n  be able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\n  \n \n  The nurse came out of the door.\n  \n \n  \"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n  \n \n  \"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eight days, in\n   \n   that\n   \n  ship.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n  \n \n  \"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n  \n \n  \"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\n  \n \n  She didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\n  \n \n  Peterson opened his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\n  \n \n  Patti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\n  \n \n  Roberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n  \n \n  \"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\n  \n \n  The Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n  \n \n  \"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n  \n \n  \"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\n  \n \n  Abruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n  \n \n  \"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\n  \n \n  Roberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\n  \n<doc-sep>Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh\nretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\nmouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\nthroats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\nout for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\nyell....\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\nonce.\"\n  \n \n  \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\nnarco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\nparade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\nwas no killing.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're alive?\"\n  \n \n  \"Alas, no. They ... died.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" Retief said. \"They died.\"\n  \n \n  \"We tried to keep them alive, of course. But we did not know what\nfoods\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?\"\n  \n \n  \"They fell ill,\" Fith said. \"One by one....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll deal with that question later,\" Retief said. \"Right now, I want\nmore information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship?\nWhat happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the\nbig parade?\"\n  \n \n  \"There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Killed in the crash landing?\"\n  \n \n  \"No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...\nTerrestrials ... were unharmed. Naturally, we feared them. They were\nstrange to us. We had never before seen such beings.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stepped off the ship with guns blazing, did they?\"\n  \n \n  \"Guns? No, no guns\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They raised their hands, didn't they? Asked for help. You helped them;\nhelped them to death.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could we know?\" Fith moaned.\n  \n \n  \"How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking\nfor them, you mean? That was a shock, wasn't it? I'll bet you had a\nbrisk time of it hiding the ship, and shutting everybody up. A close\ncall, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid,\" Shluh said. \"We are a simple people. We feared the\nstrange creatures from the alien craft. We did not kill them, but we\nfelt it was as well they ... did not survive. Then, when the warships\ncame, we realized our error.

Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n<doc-sep>  Doctor Universe\n  \n \n  By CARL JACOBI\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie, who wrote science fiction\n   \n  under the nom de plume of Annabella C.

The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away.

There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins on the morgue ship named Constellation. Sam Burnett is mentally exhausted standing in his white gown in the laboratory room of the ship. In the laboratory there are many shelves stacked upon each other, each numbered with a scarlet color. The shelves are meant to hold the 100 dead bodies that the ship is capable of storing. Once the shelves are filled, the ship is able to return back to New York. The lab is meant for performing the work of draining and preserving the dead bodies for them to then be stored. Sam leaves the laboratory at the request of Rice\u2019s calls. After they realize that Lethla is alive, Lethla orders the two to go find Kriere. They head to the control room full of levers and audio and visual plates where Sam begins to maneuver the ship. It is in the control room that Sam dies on the ship. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in space, onboard the Constellation. There are controls to drive the ship, a star-port, and claws that extend out from the ship. There is also a radio for communication and no weapons. There is also a drainage-preservative lab, transparent tables, glass retorts, and refrigerator shelves. The control-room sector of the room has an air-lock and a ladder that goes up to the area where Rice first examines Lethla. The ship also has metal walls and numbered shelves for the dead body. Outside, there is just the void where dead bodies float. However, Kriere and Lethla were able to survive using their masks of glasslite after destroying their life-boat. ",

The bottom of the ship is a laboratory with a wall full of shelves, one hundred to be exact, each for a body collected from space. The laboratory has a ladder that leads up to the air lock control room, where the rest of space is visible. The ship has a large claw attached on its exterior that is used to retrieve bodies from the void.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes places on a space ship which is a morgue called Constellation. It travels back and forth in space between Venus and Earth where war takes place. On the ship there are only two men alive making up its crew and ninety-seven dead bodies filling the designated shelves. The ship has a star-port which opens to let a metal claw pick up bodies in the void and take them inside. There is a table to put the dead on for inspection and surgery. Sam calls the ship 'cozy', it's small. The rungs lead to control-room. There is a radio to maintain connection with Earth. There are no weapons aboard. The enemy corpse is alive and Sam follows him to the visual-screen in. search of Kriere. The ship stops at detecting the body. It's crushed before being taken in, a fight takes place, and the empty shelves are filled, making Rice the only one live aboard. "

He could still hear the faint\n   \n   chop-chop\n   \n  of the waves.\n  \n \n  And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape\nglimpsed just before a faint.

He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem.

Directly across the table sat a striking,\ngrey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She\nlooked to him like a stenographer. He watched horrified as she seized\na whole roast fowl, tore it apart with her fingers, gnawed a leg. She\ncaught him staring at her and rolled her eyes at him. He returned his\ngaze to his plate.\n  \n \n  Olga said: \"Hey, Sultan.\"\n  \n \n  He shuddered, but looked up questioningly.\n  \n \n  She said, \"How's the fish?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he mumbled between a mouthful. \"Where did you get it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Caught it,\" said Olga. \"The stream's full of 'em. I'll take you\nfishing tomorrow.\" She winked at him so brazenly that he choked on a\nbone.\n  \n \n  \"Heaven forbid,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"How about coming with me to gather fruit?\" cried the green-eyed\nblonde; \"you great big handsome man.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or me?\" cried another. And the table was in an uproar.\n  \n \n  The rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table\nuntil the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was\ncalled Billy.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet!\" She shrieked in her loud strident voice. \"Let him be. He can't\ngo anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs\nrest.\" She turned to Jonathan who had shrunk down in his chair. \"How\nabout some roast?\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"No.\" He pushed back his plate with a sigh. \"If I only had a smoke.\"\n  \n \n  Olga gave her unruly black hair a flirt. \"Isn't that just like a man?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"I've forgotten what\nthey're like.\"\n  \n \n  Billy said, \"How badly wrecked is your ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's strewn all over the landscape,\" he replied sleepily.\n  \n \n  \"Is there any chance of patching it up?\"\n  \n \n  He considered the question. More than anything else, he decided, he\nwanted to sleep. \"What?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?\" repeated Billy.\n  \n \n  \"Not outside the space docks.\"\n  \n \n  They expelled their breath, but not for an instant did they relax\nthe barrage of their eyes. He shifted position in embarrassment. The\nmovement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering\nlassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes.\n  \n \n  \"You look exhausted,\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  Jonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. \"Just tired,\" he\nmumbled. \"Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars.\" Indeed\nit was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His\neyelids drooped lower and lower.\n  \n \n  \"First it's tobacco,\" said Olga; \"now he wants to sleep.

Three more\n   \n  shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and\n   \n  he would be among the living again.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws\ngroping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n  \n \n  There was another dead man aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and\nquiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;\nmachines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see\nanything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of\nthe laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,\nkeeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n  \n \n  Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical\ngown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all\ntight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.\nOpening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor\nwarrior's body out of the void.\n  \n \n  He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and\nforth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back\nfull-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,\nwho just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a\ndecent burial.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice\nfrom the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n  \n \n  \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five,\nninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight\nsurgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded\ndeep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n  \n \n  Rice said:\n  \n \n  \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day\ndrunk!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them\ninto a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and\nshoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one\nanother in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,\nsalvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n  \n \n  Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred\nother men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n  \n \n  Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots\ninside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the\nhusk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved\nfor action.\n  \n \n  This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n  \n \n  \"Sam!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative\nlab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator\nshelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to\nlife, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n  \n \n  \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n  \n \n  Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was\nworth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred\nthousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood\ncooling in it.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "At the beginning of the story, Sam Burnett makes note of the phrase to dictate the endless feeling that he associates with the conflict. He suggests that there is always going to be more bodies no matter how long or how many he retrieves. Even as victory may seem near, there is always another obstacle to face and the war never truly ends. \n\nDuring the middle of the story, Burnett questions whether it is possible for war to catch up on someone. He and Rice work on a non-combative ship and yet have found themselves thrust into a pivotal moment in the conflict that should theoretically not have ever involved them. Sam sticks to his conviction that one can still not catch up with war. \n\nWhile Sam is taking the ship towards Kriere, he thinks about whether he should fully comply with Lethla and Kriere or not to comply with their orders. He realizes that the situation as convoluted as it was, meant that he had unintentionally caught up with the war. That it was a rare and singular opportunity. While one may not be able to purposefully catch up with war, because war is unable to be controlled or predicted, it is possible for one\u2019s path to cross with war. That presents an opportunity to greatly influence the war. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The phrase \u201cyou can never catch up with war\u201d means that for Burnett\u2019s job, the war will always leave more casualties for him to clean up. Although he and the Constellation can retrieve as many bodies as they find, there will always be more bodies for them to collect. Even though many ships wave the flags of glory are ahead, Burnett\u2019s job will only ever let him go on the dark, quiet trail of death to examine the wreckage. This wreckage is almost always dead bodies that need to be brought back to Earth. As long as there is war, then the job will never end, and Burnett will never catch up to the growing pile of bodies. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Burnett repeats the phrase \"you can never catch up with the war\" in his mind as a reminder of the mundaneness and somberness of his job. His collection of bodies seems infinite, and the morgue ship follows the path of the war, but never close enough to witness it, only close enough to see the aftermath and pick up after it. Burnett is not able to experience the victories, thrills, or challenges of war. Instead, he sees its destruction and is forced to clean the mess. This phrase holds significance when Burnett decides to seize the opportunity to capture Lethla and Kriere, viewing this as a chance to finally catch up with the war.",
        "Summary_4": "This phrase is repeated several times which makes it important and emphasized. The phrase reflects Sam's feelings and attitude towards war and his job. He is overwhelmed with constant arrival of dead young bodies and feels bad about the war, he dream about its ending and return home. The phrase reflects on the amount of bodies - there are so many, that it's impossible to catch up. The horrors of war are so intense and they have such a strong impression on Sam that he can't catch up anymore. Later, the phrase gets a different meaning - the morgue ship stayed away from real war dealing with the dead only. Lethra's arrival changes it and brings war to the ship, making it caught up by war without intention. "

It wasn't a question of saving money.\nI hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\nalso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\nmachine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n  \n \n  Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\na gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\nword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\nIt was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\nvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\nreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\nsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n  \n \n  \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\nYou might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\nthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\nwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\nbut how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\nthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\nmachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\nI threw might be imitated.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\ndo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\nwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that\nthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\ncontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\nsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\nobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\nout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\nstiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\ncould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\nelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\nand to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\nnothing to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n  \n \n  \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\nsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\na long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\nand a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\nI went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\never sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n  \n \n  \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\nseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX\nINDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM\nPLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE\nPLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY\nUSED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE\nPUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.\nI DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN\nSTEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE\nBUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS\nOPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING\nYOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\nman was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\nmight mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n  \n \n  \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I\nhad altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\nme pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\nactivated.\n  \n \n  \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\nwas learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\ncould watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\nto increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\nrewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\nit for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\nalmost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n  \n \n  At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\nsilently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\nhad taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\nThen the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How\ndo you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\nreplied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n  \n \n  A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\nin an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\nrose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\non it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\ndo, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\nstopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\nabout something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\noffice, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\nornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\nbe matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\ntime, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n  \n \n  Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\nso he kept silent.\n  \n<doc-sep>  SURVIVAL\n   \n  TACTICS\n  \n \n  By AL SEVCIK\n  \n \n  ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK\n  \n \n \n   The robots were built to serve\nMan; to do his work, see to his\ncomforts, make smooth his way.\nThen the robots figured out an\nadditional service\u2014putting Man\nout of his misery.\n   \n \n \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

But nerve\nhas to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\nand eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\nClay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\nappointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't\nknow what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\nsent him.\"\n  \n \n  The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\nbetray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\nand studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\nlarge for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\nsightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\nhe ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n  \n \n  He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\nthe building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\nmore ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\nordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n  \n \n  There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\nnone at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\nthe electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\nThey jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\nas they should have been for a plant this size.\n  \n \n  Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\nwhat it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\nchanging shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\nstreet, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to\nhandle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\nstairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\nemployees' entrance was on the third side.\n  \n \n  It wasn't.\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Peter Manners is awaiting his job interview at Lex Industries. He is very nervous but also has to worry about still being unemployed with barely any money saved. Since he is fifteen minutes early, he decides to look around the manufacturing plant. Peter then goes to his interview, and a voice from a loudspeaker directs him down to the hall where Mr. Lexington is waiting. He goes in through the multiple doors, where Mr. Lexington greets him roughly and looks over his qualifications. The other man begins asking Peter questions, to which Peter responds but is confused about how they have any relation to his job application. Mr. Lexington tells Peter that he has been stockpiled at his last company, given skills that will only ever help that specific company and nowhere else. Mr. Lexington then tells Peter that he had just proven that he has fewer skills than when he was in school, but he is pleased by Peter\u2019s performance in the interview so far nonetheless. He tells Peter that he is the only person in the building and makes Peter follow him. They go through the machinery, and they reach the inside of a loading truck. Mr. Lexington explains that this area is where raw materials are delivered and that he has small machines, part of a bigger machine, all working together to operate the factory. They go to the office section of the building, where there is a small typewriter working. A central control mechanism operates everything, and Mr. Lexington does not even have to deal with much mail at all each week. Mr. Lexington explains his own history working as an engineer and how he spent most of his time developing his machinery. Peter is amazed by all of the machinery, and he continues to discuss machine parts such as the kicker button with Mr. Lexington. Just as they keep talking, the door opens, and a self-propelled cart asks if he would like cream and sugar with his coffee. Mr. Lexington is angry about the cup, and he insults them as being impractical. He also further clarifies that Lex Industries is named after his wife Alexis\u2019 nickname. The company continues to earn a lot of money, and he also does not need to monitor progress constantly. Mr. Lexington also mentions that when he was extremely pleased with progress one day, he went to the kicker button and found it removed. He asked the machine what was going on, and the machine sent him a long message detailing how it was aware of when he was pleased with the progress made and had relieved him of the burden of having to press it every time.",
        "Summary_2": "Peter Manners is nervous about an interview that is about to begin. He tries to waste time so as not to appear too eager for the interview so he walks around the building to entertain himself. When he looks around the building he finds the building construction strange. He keeps going around the building growing more curious about its construction. He then frantically returns to the entrance after he realizes the time. Peter walks through the entrance and eventually makes it to Mr. Lexington\u2019s office where he is commanded to enter and sit down. The interview begins and Peter starts off the interview well to Mr. Lexington\u2019s acknowledgement. Peter tries to avoid being intimidated by Mr. Lexington\u2019s quick and blunt questioning to prove himself worthy of receiving the job offer. As the interview continues, Peter begins to get frustrated and angry with Mr. Lexington\u2019s line of questioning. During the interview, Mr. Lexington lets Peter know that he is the only worker in the building much to Peter\u2019s amazement. \n\nMr. Lexington begins to lead Peter out of the office and they walk to the manufacturing area as the interview continues. He explains to Peter that he uses machines to unload the trucks. He continues to lead Peter to a large bay area where different materials are stored. While Mr. Lexington is enthusiastic about the machines, Peter seems to be very wary about them. He stops to ask what Mr. Lexington does if the machines take care of the job duties. Peter is shocked to learn that he does basically nothing. \n\nMr. Lexington then sits down and explains to Peter how the machines were created. He tells Peter that he created a new company with the single unit machinery that was more successful than his original company that focused on specialized machines. His new company was able to buy out his old company. He goes on to say that to help the single unit machine learn he created an incentive for it. The incentive was based on whether Mr. Lexington was happy with the performance of the machine or not. The machine eventually learned by watching what Mr. Lexington did and focuses on taking over more responsibilities to continue to give Mr. Lexington pleasure. The machine continued to increase its abilities and made risky decisions that proved to be very beneficial to the company. The story ends with Mr. Lexington relaying a story to Peter about how the machine eventually grew so savvy that it removed Mr. Lexington\u2019s indicator for the machine that he was happy with its performance because the machine stated that it was able to discern his happiness without the button and thus no longer needed it. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Peter Manners is an engineer in search of a job. He arrives at Lex Industries for an interview set up for him by the Association of Professional Engineers. Peter arrives early, so to kill time, he walks around the exterior of the building. He is perplexed by the building, namely due to the lack of windows, abundance of electricity, and no side entrance. As he enters through automatic doors for his interview, he is led to a large office where Mr. Lexington is waiting for him. Mr. Lexington first interrogates Peter with questions that all seem to have hidden traps, including questions about his previous job, where he suggests that Peter had been stockpiled. Mr. Lexington then reveals to Peter the true operations of Lex Industries; he is the only person in the factory, and the rest are machines. Mr. Lexington takes Peter on a tour of the factory, where he sees robots, called \"manipulators\", perform manufacturing, loading, and other business tasks. Mr. Lexington explains his journey with the machinery, telling Peter about his origins in engineering, including his late wife Alexis and his devotion to his work. Mr. Lexington had opened the current factory to be run by machinery, eventually overtaking his original company. A key piece of his success had been the use of a kicker button, which signaled pleasure to the robots and eventually got them to develop a sort of conscious. The robots had chosen the name \"Lex\" for themselves. Mr. Lexington then tells Peter that one day, he found the kicker button to be removed, and received a message from Lex that said they had learned to tell whether or not they were doing a good job without the button, and declared their faith and loyalty to him.",
        "Summary_4": "Peter Manners nervously awaits his job interview in front of the office's weird building. Finally, he enters a place with everything being automated and approaches Mr. Lexington, a huge man at a huge desk, the interviewer. The dialogue is hard, Mr. Lexington is straightforward and harsh in his questions, Peter thinks well and answers with caution but gets angry in the end. Eventually, he is accepted as he is found \"teachable\". Lexington gives Peter a tour around the manufacturing area, where everything is automated and done by machines. The building is filled with robots doing every kind of job, their abundance scares Peter and reminds of the articles about the future. Lexington tells the story of his business - without education in this field, he created the business and was expanding it, replacing people by robots. Eventually, he created a system without specialization controlling the whole process, with him being the only employee and doing almost nothing. The system called itself Lex in honor of Lexington's late wife Alexis, removed the kicker button and take charge of some things, making Lexington scared to lose control. "

        "Summary_1": "Mr. Lexington is the owner of Lex Industries. He is the only person in the manufacturing plant. He is an eccentric but genius man who is surrounded by his machinery. Lexington started his business twenty years ago, and he never went through university despite having many interests. He gave up arts and biology, later re-entering through engineering. He also went through many stages, including commerce, accounting, and even working for a competitor. Lexington is especially interested in machine parts, which led him to begin firing employees and replacing them with automatic machines. His wife died in a car accident earlier, so he focused all of his attention on the machinery. By creating the central control system, he could give up his old company and build this new one. Although he is very rough towards Peter, he is also somewhat sympathetic to Peter\u2019s past experiences and skills. He is very proud of his machinery and does not hesitate to show all of it to Peter.",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Lexington is the founder of Lex Industries. Peter describes him as having a large frame accompanied with large muscles. The first time that Peter meets Mr. Lexington, Mr. Lexington angrily yells for him to enter the office. It shows that Mr. Lexington can be very commanding. During the interview, Mr. Lexington asks questions trying in an attempt to be intimidating and trick Peter. He is quick to be angered and embarrassed, quickly showing his displeasure at any slightly upsetting situation. Besides his emotions, Mr. Lexington appears to tire easily after the walk through the building and his face shows his elderly age.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Mr. Lexington is the owner of Lex Industries, an electrical company. He is the overseer of all operations in the plant, and because of his success, incredibly wealthy. He is described as a large man, initially seeming to be unbreakable but then noted to have a somber, fragile expression. Mr. Lexington is confident and intimidating, evident in his interview with Peter Manners. He is knowledgable, not just about electrical engineering, but about biology, specifically cell structure and the foundations of living. Though Mr. Lexington approves of Peter, his temper is short, demonstrated when one of the robots adjusts his handkerchief as well as when he is brought coffee.",
        "Summary_4": "Mr. Lexington is a huge man of around 65 years. He is rich - his office is extremely modern and automated. He is very straightforward and harsh, he is also clever and strict, he makes others afraid of him. He loves machines and made everything automated in his office and manufacturing area. He is very demanding from employees. He criticizes the world system around. - the specialization, the stockpiling of graduates. He created the multi-purpose control circuit in his business as he wanted to replace all the workers with robots easily controlled, and he built the whole business by himself without education in the field. He has always been very concentrated on his job, paying it even more attention than to his late wife. He is very rational and practical, and he wants everything to be logical and perfect, even the coffee cups. He hates losing time so he started living at his work - very practical. "

        "Query": "What is the location and atmosphere of LEX Industries, as described in the story?",
        "Article": " \n  LEX\n  \n \n  By W. T. HAGGERT\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WOOD\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Nothing in the world could be happier and\n    \n   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but\n    \n   what happens when it loves him back?\n   \n \n \n \n  Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve\nhas to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero\nand eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.\nClay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the\nappointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't\nknow what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've\nsent him.\"\n  \n \n  The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would\nbetray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant\nand studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not\nlarge for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its\nsightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if\nhe ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n  \n \n  He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about\nthe building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,\nmore ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and\nordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n  \n \n  There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and\nnone at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for\nthe electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.\nThey jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large\nas they should have been for a plant this size.\n  \n \n  Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out\nwhat it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees\nchanging shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the\nstreet, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to\nhandle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any\nstairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the\nemployees' entrance was on the third side.\n  \n \n  It wasn't.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n  \n \n  \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n  \n \n  \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n  \n \n  \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens tried to understand that.\n  \n \n  \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n  \n \n  \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly. Then it added,\npointing an arm at the robot near Ball: \"The age of\u2014Peb\u2014is seventeen\nyears, one month and four days. Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\n  \n \n  He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\n  \n \n  Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\n  \n \n  His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n  \n \n  \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\n  \n \n  Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n  \n \n  \"No, we do not build ourselves. We are made by the\u2014\" another pause for\na word\u2014\"by the\n   \n   Factory\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The Factory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?\"\n  \n \n  Both of the Earthmen nodded dumbly.\n  \n \n  \"Would you prefer to use your\u2014skiff? It is quite a long way from here.\"\n  \n \n  It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Verana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\n  \n \n  Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\n   \n   Who\n   \n  are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n  \n \n  \"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n  \n \n  \"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n  \n \n  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story is set at Lex Industries. The manufacturing plant has no employee doors, and there are no windows on the side and rear of the building. Peter goes through the many doors to reach the office. The office has a huge desk, a chair behind the desk, and a chair in front of it. The office also is also carpeted by a sound-deadening rug, massive leather chairs, framed paintings, expensive drapes, and even a glass-brick mantel fireplace. The plant is filled with machinery of all kinds, and there are factory lights that constantly shine on the machines that do work. There are many types of machines too, such as ones that look like a pair of hands and even a typewriter. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Peter Manners standing in front of Lex Industries plant building. He inquisitively looks over the building and notices that it has a strange build. The building is a plain concrete wall with windows only on the front and not the sides or rear. \n\nWhen Peter returns to the entrance of the building he goes through a side door that automatically opens for him. He walks through many doors that open and close automatically for him until he reaches Mr. Lexington\u2019s office. Mr. Lexington\u2019s office was heavily decorated with carpet throughout and oversized furniture decorating it. During the interview, they leave Mr. Lexington\u2019s office and go to explore the building. Mr. Lexington leads Peter through different areas of the plant and eventually to a maze of machines. Once they are done with the tour, they head towards the office section of the building to continue their discussion. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place inside the Lex Industries factory plant. The exterior, as noted by Peter, is strange; there are no windows around the sides of the buildings, the electrical sources were abnormally large, and there was no side entrance for employees to use. The doors to the entrance are automatic, and they lead him to Mr. Lexington's office. His office is large and luxurious with lush decor, indicating his wealth. Mr. Lexington then shows Peter around the factory, where he sees the manufacturing area, the loading area, and the business area, all filled with countless robots performing duties.",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins outside the Lex Industries plant. The building is extremely plain from the outside with no windows on the sides, inside it's automated, with all the doors opening, lights turning on and off and a voice greeting the visitors. The building is empty inside, with only Mr. Lexington sitting at his huge table. There is a manufacturing area and truck doors inside, where everything is done by robots. In the office area there are rooms for sorting mail, other designated for bookkeeping and another one for purchase orders, all done by machines as well. "

        "Query": "What is the importance of the machinery in LEX and how does it contribute to Mr. Lexington's success?",
        "Article": "Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\neach one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\nor carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\nsomething to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\neverywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\nexact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\ndoing it.\n  \n \n  He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\naisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\nonrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\nspeeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\nthat was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\nexit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\nwhere they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\ngo by.\n  \n \n  Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\nroom where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard\nbusiness machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\nthat room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\ntypewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\nkeyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\nthis one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\nthere's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\nbookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"\nasked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\nhad engulfed him.\n  \n \n  \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\nevery week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n  \n \n  The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\nwhen they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\nlooked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\nsagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\nsilence remain unbroken.\n  \n \n  Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run\narticles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\ntwenty years in the future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\n\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\nidiotic notions about specialization.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\nApparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\nalthough it hadn't been strenuous.\n  \n<doc-sep>Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\nhe continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\ndidn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\nproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\nI hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\nalso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\nmachine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n  \n \n  Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\na gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\nword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\nIt was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\nvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\nreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\nsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n  \n \n  \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\nYou might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\nthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\nwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\nbut how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\nthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\nmachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\nI threw might be imitated.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\ndo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\nwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that\nthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\ncontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\nsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\nobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\nout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\nstiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\ncould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\nelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\nand to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\nnothing to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n  \n \n  \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\nsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\na long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\nand a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\nI went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\never sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n  \n \n  \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\nseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX\nINDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM\nPLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE\nPLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY\nUSED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE\nPUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.\nI DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN\nSTEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE\nBUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS\nOPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING\nYOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\nman was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\nmight mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n  \n \n  \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I\nhad altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\nme pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\nactivated.\n  \n \n  \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\nwas learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\ncould watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\nto increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\nrewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\nit for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\nalmost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n  \n \n  At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\nsilently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\nhad taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\nThen the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How\ndo you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\nreplied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n  \n \n  A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\nin an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\nrose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\non it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\ndo, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\nstopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\nabout something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\noffice, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\nornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\nbe matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\ntime, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n  \n \n  Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\nso he kept silent.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

He nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n  \n \n  \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent\nbasis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n  \n \n  Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has\nbeen, yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going.

And the\nstockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the\nhell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have\nto, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the\nsolution?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n  \n \n  Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.\nWhat makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n  \n \n  \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left\nschool.

He nodded with inexpressible\ntiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to\nbe made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your\nillusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or\ncynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility\nor cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.\nThose were the important things. The background data I got from the\nAssociation on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.\nI think you are. Am I right?\"\n  \n \n  \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if\nthat answers the question.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n  \n \n  In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows\nat sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,\nthe lack of employees' entrances.\n  \n \n  \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic\ndoors. Anything else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n  \n \n  Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but\nthey all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar\nproducts or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or\nwater-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the\ngoods.\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show\nyou.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with\nthis plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one\nstarted working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought\nthe old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my\nassets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n  \n \n  \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it\nwasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked\nimpossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the\ncontrol section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was\na comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit\nnevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I\nfigured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that\nthey could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one\naction with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n  \n \n  \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units\nwould be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of\nactivity that I'd already established.\"\n  \n \n  Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there\nand did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and\nthen I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a\nsort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it\nwas still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its\nprime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could\nonly be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early\nTV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,\nevery order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n  \n \n  \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I\npressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its\nlogic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that\nbutton. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't\ngoing well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,\nor maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead\nof time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.\nPretty soon the machine got the idea.\n  \n \n  \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one\nof the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I\ntried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me\nat first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could\ndiscover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the\norder was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time\nconvincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other\nexplanation.\n  \n \n  \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I\ncopied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the\nconsole keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back\nof the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the\nkeyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the\nkicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n  \n \n  \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure\ncenter in an animal's brain, isn't it?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been\njolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a\nreply that would cost him this job.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you\nhave any knowledge of medicine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n  \n \n  \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean\nthings like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the\n   \n   basics\n   \n  of how\nwe live.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n  \n \n  \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions\nthey're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\nout of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After\nI got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\nan electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\ncompany\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n  \n \n  Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.\n\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\nwith money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\ntheir products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\ncalculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\naren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter\nadmitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\ncalculus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\nengineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\nbe useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\ngetting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\nthese birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\nget a job with someone else?\"\n  \n \n  Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\nsent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\nseen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been\neasy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\nprocedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\nyou'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\nscared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\nsomething you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\nout of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\nany wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\ndegree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely\nin contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's\narrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n  \n \n  \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this\nbusiness twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got\nthrough university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and\ngot so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.\nThey bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,\ndetermined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too\nabsorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical\ntheory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I\ntried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for\none of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only\nway I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he\nspoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,\nbecause I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.\nAfter three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I\nsuppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for\na strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My\nwife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,\nwas killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that\nmade me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't\nmade things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time\nto spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I\nremember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the\ngirl.\n  \n \n  \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many\nemployees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd\ndesign the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up\nmyself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it\nwasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my\nplant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more\nbusiness I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one\nmulti-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from\nordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told\nyou, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,\nand from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical\nknowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,\nbut I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,\ncompare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,\nof course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic\ndrums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount\nEverest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the\nwork for me.\n  \n \n  \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in\npredetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry\nin units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of\nthe logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same\nway they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into\nelectrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,\nand once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n  \n \n  \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to\ncompete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to\ndo only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in\nthe back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do\nwould be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving\nme free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue\nnumbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the\nmoney.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The machinery is what keeps Lex Industries running and for Mr. Lexington to earn astronomical amounts of money continuously. It replaces the need for human workers and saves much of the costs that would have had to be distributed to workers. It is also the lifeline of Mr. Lexington\u2019s work and the breakthrough of his research career. Peter considers the machinery to be ideas that are planned for ten to twenty years into the future. This makes the machinery even more impressive. The fact that an entire business can be operated with the central control system makes it even more significant in helping Mr. Lexington get ahead of his competitors.",
        "Summary_2": "The machinery is very important to Mr. Lexington\u2019s company. He uses them for all of the tasks necessary to run the company, such as unloading the trucks and the supply chain department. The machines helped Mr. Lexington grow his business and make more money. He didn\u2019t like the specialization that many people focused on when creating machines to replace humans which is why he created a single unit taking inspiration from biology. They are modelled by the behavior of biology as Mr. Lexington is very fascinated by the subject. The machinery was able to increase its intelligence by learning from watching what Mr. Lexington did and taking over those responsibilities. The machine proved to become increasingly self-aware and intelligent to Mr. Lexington\u2019s surprise. ",
        "Summary_3": "The machinery used at Lex Industries is the product of years of trial and error by Mr. Lexington to create the most profitable business model. He has designed the machinery to operate on one multi-purpose control circuit, and gradually taught the machines to remember, detect patters, and define success. The latter was accomplished using a \"kicker button\", which Mr. Lexington would press when he was pleased with the factory's operations. The machinery and its efficiency is what has made Lex Industries so successful; the short production time, fast shipping, and little labor. ",
        "Summary_4": "Machines are doing everything in Lex Industries, they replace every human job. Doors are opening by themselves, the lights turn on and off on their own as people go by. An automatic voice meets the visitors instead of a secretary. Bookkeeping, mail sorting, unloading trucks, checking the cargo, sorting it, and all other parts of production are made by robots. They are controlled by one main system of the plant, making it one automatic system. The machines fill the building and make it lonely, they scare Peter, while Lexington loves them. Such structure reminds Peter of the plans for the future, as other such offices do not exist. Machines deprive Lexington of any job at all for months and even take control sometimes, they even threaten his authority. "

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,\neach one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding\nor carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for\nsomething to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were\neverywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an\nexact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of\ndoing it.\n  \n \n  He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same\naisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the\nonrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the\nspeeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press\nthat was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an\nexit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know\nwhere they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to\ngo by.\n  \n \n  Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small\nroom where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard\nbusiness machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In\nthat room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the\ntypewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the\nkeyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In\nthis one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall\nthere's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic\nbookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"\nasked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that\nhad engulfed him.\n  \n \n  \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in\nevery week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n  \n \n  The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face\nwhen they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington\nlooked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face\nsagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the\nsilence remain unbroken.\n  \n \n  Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run\narticles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe\ntwenty years in the future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\n\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their\nidiotic notions about specialization.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.\nApparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,\nalthough it hadn't been strenuous.\n  \n<doc-sep>It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play\nthis straight all the way.

I mean\nthings like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the\n   \n   basics\n   \n  of how\nwe live.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n  \n \n  \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions\nthey're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them\nout of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After\nI got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with\nan electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The\ncompany\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n  \n \n  Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.\n\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them\nwith money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of\ntheir products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in\ncalculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,\naren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter\nadmitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in\ncalculus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an\nengineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would\nbe useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were\ngetting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of\nthese birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to\nget a job with someone else?\"\n  \n \n  Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had\nsent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd\nseen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been\neasy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their\nprocedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And\nyou'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be\nscared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do\nsomething you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you\nout of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at\nany wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a\ndegree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time\nhe had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,\nset to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had\nopened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but\na soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.\nManners?\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   are\n   \n  Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n  \n \n  He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a\nmicrophone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down\nthe hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open\nfor him.\n  \n \n  He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his\ngrip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening\nbefore and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of\nhis calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n  \n \n  \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n  \n \n  Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped\njust short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,\nall the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an\ninterview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to\nunnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n  \n \n  He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,\nstraightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying\nfor a position should.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n  \n \n  He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in\nfront of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.\nHe did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n  \n \n  The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with\na high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and\nmassive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed\npaintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with\nflowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor\ninto Hollywood's idea of an office.\n  \n \n  His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted\nfor another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of\nframe supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and\ndrawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n  \n \n  But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age\nto the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the\ncomplexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and\nthis was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n  \n \n  \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly.\n  \n<doc-sep>When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this\nman was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little\nmight mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n  \n \n  \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I\nhad altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give\nme pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be\nactivated.\n  \n \n  \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine\nwas learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine\ncould watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had\nto increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the\nrewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing\nit for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do\nalmost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n  \n \n  At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled\nsilently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he\nhad taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.\nThen the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How\ndo you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and\nreplied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n  \n \n  A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole\nin an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface\nrose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested\non it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to\ndo, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it\nstopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry\nabout something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the\noffice, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n  \n \n  Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and\nornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to\nbe matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of\ntime, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n  \n \n  Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,\nso he kept silent.\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then\nhe continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I\ndidn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working\nproperly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.\nI hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I\nalso wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the\nmachine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n  \n \n  Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took\na gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written\nword, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.\nIt was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny\nvocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and\nreplies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed\nsome traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n  \n \n  \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.\nYou might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of\nthe name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it\nwas named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,\nbut how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind\nthat I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the\nmachine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums\nI threw might be imitated.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to\ndo, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation\nwas slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that\nthe machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and\ncontracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on\nsome orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any\nobvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn\nout that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against\nstiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we\ncould get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one\nelse was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,\nand to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually\nnothing to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n  \n \n  \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with\nsomething, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button\na long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,\nand a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.\nI went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had\never sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n  \n \n  \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had\nseen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX\nINDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM\nPLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE\nPLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY\nUSED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE\nPUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.\nI DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN\nSTEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE\nBUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS\nOPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING\nYOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Peter first meets Mr. Lexington at his interview. He finds the other man strange from the seemingly random questions that he asks. Mr. Lexington, however, becomes more interested in Peter when he is satisfied with the responses given. While the two of them are not close, Mr. Lexington does not dismiss him on the spot and instead takes him to tour the entire factory. He also elaborates on his life story to Peter, and he does have a certain degree of trust for the other man. On the other hand, Peter is very impressed by Mr. Lexington\u2019s work and becomes more interested in how he has accomplished all of this in the time since he first began working on his business.",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Lexington is the owner of Lex Industries and is interviewing Peter who is seeking a job. Mr. Lexington has the power of being in control of the situation because his decision is what will give Peter a job or not. Peter is initially intimidated by Mr. Lexington but as the interview continues, Peter begins to no longer be intimidated by Mr. Lexington and is able to match his challenging gaze. As the interview continues, the two settle into a friendly conversation with Mr. Lexington relaying stories about the growth of the machine\u2019s intelligence. ",
        "Summary_3": "Peter is intimidated by Mr. Lexington throughout the story; he views him as a powerful, wealthy, angry man, though he warms up to him gradually. Peter makes several remarks throughout the interview to win Mr. Lexington's approval. First, he doesn't answer when Mr. Lexington asks him what he can do. He additionally notes his observations of the outside of the building. Peter presents himself as a man capable of learning the ways of Lex Industries, which Mr. Lexington likes. However, despite this approval, Mr. Lexington still challenges Peter's thinking and statements, assuring himself as the superior.",
        "Summary_4": "Peter is willing to work for Mr. Lexington's company. Getting the job is vital for him, he will be evicted if he doesn't get it. After what he has heard, Peter is scared of the man, he is cautious in his words, though sometimes he can't control his anger and confusion. Lexington sees Peter as a teachable young man and prefers him to previous ones, though he doesn't like people that much overall. Nevertheless, Lexington tells Peter the story of his business and shows around, putting a start to their co-work. "

        "Query": "What happens in Hagerty's Enzymes?",
        "Article": "There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper\nbleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for\nthe opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the\ndesk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n  \n \n  \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots\naround here, have you?\"\n  \n \n  Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what\nthey did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here\nwhile I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed\nin months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The\nonly meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his\nfist and contemplated the outrage.\n  \n \n  \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n  \n \n  \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with\nthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You\ntry it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I\nhad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready\nto staff my offices with the things!\"\n  \n \n  The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and\ngroaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use\nsome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I\nate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You\nmean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm\nsuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's\nEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth\nmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.\nFactory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they\ncould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in\nfact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,\nhe's about out of business.\"\n  \n \n  Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.\nBut just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a\nhorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third\nrobot enter, wheeling a chair.\n  \n \n  \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing\nwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!\nTake it away!\"\n  \n \n  The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and\nruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither\nbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his\nebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n  \n \n  The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to\nJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take\nme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the\ntreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped\nhim down and marched out with him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver\nof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,\nmechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>She listened intently, trying to find a reason for fear in the\nexplanation. It would have taken many human generations to adapt to\nMinos by ordinary evolution, and that only at a heavy toll of death and\nhunger which evolution exacts. There was a shorter way: Human cells\nhave the ability to return to their primeval condition of independence,\nhunting, eating and reproducing alone.\n  \n \n  Alexander P. Mead took human cells and made them into phagocytes.\nHe put them through the hard savage school of evolution\u2014a thousand\ngenerations of multiplication, hardship and hunger, with the alien\nindigestible food always present, offering its reward of plenty to the\ncell that reluctantly learned to absorb it.\n  \n \n  \"Leucocytes can run through several thousand generations of evolution\nin six months,\" Pat Mead finished. \"When they reached to a point where\nthey would absorb Minos food, he planted them back in the people he\nhad taken them from.\"\n  \n \n  \"What was supposed to happen then?\" Max asked, leaning forward.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know exactly how it worked. He never told anybody much about\nit, and when I was a little boy he had gone loco and was wandering\nha-ha-ing around waving a test tube. Fell down a ravine and broke his\nneck at the age of eighty.\"\n  \n \n  \"A character,\" Max said.\n  \n \n  Why was she afraid? \"It worked then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.

He placed\ntwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He\nclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner\nfrom jumping.\n  \n \n  \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and\nlet go of everything.\"\n  \n \n  Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And\ngently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated\ntenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n  \n \n  For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge\nhe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously\nstationary sofa.\n  \n \n  \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.\nFranz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a\ntrial?\"\n  \n \n  Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That\nprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for\nweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like\na four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling\nbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely\noutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you\nlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run\nthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's\ncausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd\ncrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n\"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook\nafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged\nman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving\nme to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,\nreasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the\nidiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the\nnew colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.\n\"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk\ntwenty years ago?\"\n  \n \n  Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he\nrasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt!

I thought you people\nhad no doctors.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a story.\" Pat leaned back again. \"Alexander P. Mead, the head of\nthe Mead clan, was a plant geneticist, a very determined personality\nand no man to argue with. He didn't want us to go through the struggle\nof killing off all Minos plants and putting in our own, spoiling the\nface of the planet and upsetting the balance of its ecology. He decided\nthat he would adapt our genes to this planet or kill us trying.

What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>III\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep>  \"Any problem posed by one group of\nhuman beings can be resolved by any\nother group.\" That's what the Handbook\nsaid.

Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall....\n  \n \n  \"I've got a good figure,\" she said thoughtfully.\n  \n \n  Max turned at the door. \"Why this sudden interest in your looks?\" he\nasked suspiciously. \"Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally\nget something to eat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute.\" She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully,\nusing a combination from the ship's directory. \"How're you doing, Pat?\"\n  \n \n  The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray. There was a startled\nchuckle. \"Voices, too! Hello, June. How do you tell a machine to go\njump in the lake?\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you hungry?\"\n  \n \n  \"No food since yesterday.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll have a banquet ready for you when you get out,\" she told Pat and\nhung up, smiling. Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which\nmade shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast.\n  \n \n  They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing\nhamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of\nPat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of\nantihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system\nwould treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human\nblood cells, and fight back against them violently.\n  \n \n  One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive,\nso that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human\ncells, and thus succumb more rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked.\n  \n \n  \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently.\n  \n \n  On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a\nviewplate. It showed a long scene of mountains in the distance on the\nhorizon, and between them, rising step by step as they grew farther\naway, the low rolling hills, bronze and red with patches of clear green\nwhere there were fields.\n  \n \n  Someone was looking out, standing very still, as if she had been\nthere a long time\u2014Bess St. Clair, a Canadian woman. \"It looks like\nWinnipeg,\" she told them as they paused. \"When are you doctors going to\nlet us out of this blithering barberpole?

There is also a fungus that grows there that breaks down crude oil, a financial gold mine! \nHarper decides to go to this hotel, both for rest and the opportunity of getting into this new fungi business. After what seems like a mere number of hours, the rocket comes into land, and Harper goes directly to the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel. \nHarper notices the beauty of his surroundings, and how the entire hotel is staffed by very efficient, silent robots. He goes over to the desk, where a woman is complaining to the clerk about the treatment she is receiving from these robots. Harper decides to go over and interrupt the conversation, asking for his room key. \nA large man walks over, also asking for service. In a panic, the clerk hastily gives a room key to Harper, and hands him off to a robot to show him to his room. \nHarper arrives in his room where he gets settled, and then makes his way to the restaurant. Suddenly, Harper wakes up to see two robots bending over him. They take him by force and wheel him away into surgery. \nHarper wakes up to find the same man from the clerk desk knocking at his door. The man introduces himself as Jake Ellis, of Hagerty's Enzymes. He works on the tundra in the fungus \nplants. Two more robots enter and take Harper away again.

Harper proposes that the clerk probably mixed up their room keys. They decide to switch rooms and clothes to see what happens.  \nHarper goes to Ellis' room, puts on his clothes, and walks down to the lobby, where he meets the clerk once again.

His sister is urging him to follow Dr. Franz's instructions to go on vacation. Harp's brother-in-law, Scribney, intervenes and shows a picture of the most luxurious hotel on Mars with curative springs. Scribney also hints Harper about a business opportunity in the hotel. It convinces Harper and he decides to combine rest with business after all. He soon boards on the rocket that is filled with soporific gas, so Harper arrives at the hotel lobby relaxed. The hotel is gorgeous indeed and the robots are offering all kinds of services throughout the place. The least impresses Harp as his human employees are the source of his irritation, so his new goal is to introduce the robots to his office later. Then he hears a woman at the front desk demanding a human nurse as the robots are too good and she wants to be heard. Harper proceeds to his room with a beautiful view and enjoys the silent robots' company. Then he dines in the rooftop restaurant and returns to his room in a good mood, willing to relax. Suddenly, he is bundled onto the stretcher and wheeled out by two robots, though he asked for no nursing. Harper is outraged with the robots pumping out all of his meal and at his own helplessness, he is disappointed in the machines. He tells all of this to his unexpected visitor, Jake Ellis, who, on the contrary, desperately wants treatment. Turns out the man works in severe conditions in tundra with fungus plants. His owner is soon going to be broke, as the workers quit the hard job which better fits robots. For the next couple days Harper is forced to go through various procedures which make him look and feel better, but also make him angry with being helpless. He believes there is a mistake and offers to switch rooms with Jake, who still desperately wants his treatment. Harper puts on Jake's huge clothes and goes to the lobby looking ridiculous. When a clerk orders the robot guards to take the patient away, Harper starts fighting back, and the clerk, scared the system would break, calls them off. Harper is led to the manager and after a brief outburst of his rage the manager tells that the hotel is going broke anyway, because people can't mix with robots, so he doesn't care what Harper can do to him. Now the hotel can't hire humans as it has spent all the money on robots and Harper offers to buy them. When he returns to Earth, he is met by Bella, his sister, and Scribney. Harper says he bought both the robots and the enzymes and switched the workers, saving both firms from bankruptcy.

He angrily calls out Dr. Franz for another useless method. Bella insists on a vacation, but Harper vehemently denies the idea because he is busy. His brother-in-law brings up his involvement in the sinking of Martian equatorial wells twenty years ago, making him even angrier. Scribney shows Harper a hotel completely staffed by robots. Bella mentions that the Durants came back from that place in much better shape after resting in the Martian springs. Scribney also brings up the possibility for great fortune because of the discovery breakthrough involving enzymes and Martian fungi. Harper agrees to the vacation because he can rest and do business. Once he arrives at the Emerald Star hotel, he observes how the robots work at perfect efficiency and silently. He then sees a woman arguing with the human desk clerk about seeing a real human nurse. Harper concludes that she wants somebody to boss around and strides confidently to check himself in. She is offended by his intrusion, but he reminds her that civility is not a normal human trait. As the clerk checks him in, another newcomer comes to complain. Harper goes to his beautiful room and begins to enjoy his vacation. After lunch and smoking a cigar, two robots come to his room for treatment. Later, the newcomer returns and asks Harper about the service he received from the robots earlier. The man introduces himself as Jake Ellis of Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes. Harper becomes interested in the company he works at, but three robots come inside to take him away on a wheelchair before he can say more. They also ignore Jake Ellis, who continuously pleads for treatment. The robots put him through similar ordeals for the next five days, and he is sick of it the next time he sees Jake Ellis. They theorize that the clerk initially mixed the keys up and plans to find the manager. Wearing Ellis\u2019 clothes, he goes down to the lobby and shocks the other guests. The clerk is shocked and tries to get the robots to treat him. Harper furiously denies it and threatens to destroy the switchboard. The manager greets him, and he voices all of his complaints. Hayes, the manager, gives up with a sigh and tells Harper that they are about to go bankrupt from the robots. Harper calms down, and he asks to speak to the owners about a potential business deal forming in his head. Afterwards, he returns to Bella and Scribney, looking much fitter and younger. He tells them he has bought Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes and staffed it with robots. When Scribney asks about using them in the office capacity, Harper says he wants nothing to do with them.

Since he does not listen to the healer, Franz\u2019s advices, his sister and brother-in-law suggest that he has to make a trip to receive a rest-cure at the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars. Attracts by robot servants and potential value of Martian fungus, Harper goes on the trip immediately. However, the life in the hotel is not completely as Harper expected. Harper thinks that the robots are efficient, so he considers about having the robots worker in his office. However, living in the hotel and coming into direct contact with the robots makes him change his mind. The robots simply cannot communicate with humans. They are determined to follow what they are programmed to do. Though his sleep problem is largely improved, and his appetite is much better than before, he is forced by robots to stay in stinking mud-baths, and consume weird concoctions. These robots even take away his cloths. His yelling and protests does not work with the robots. Harper\u2019s neighbor, Jake Ellis, who works in Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes, desires Harper\u2019s treatment. As a result, Harper and Jake agree to exchanged their rooms. Then, Harper finally gets the chance to wear Jake\u2019s clothes and go down to the lobby of the hotel. After talking with the manager of the hotel, and combining Jake\u2019s description of his job, Harper thinks that it is a good idea for business. The hotel wishes to get rid of these robots because humans and robots simply cannot get along with each other. The hotel is going bankrupt because of the robot workers. At the same time, The Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes\u2019 human workers are leaving because the job did not have satisfying working conditions. Thus, both companies are in the danger of bankruptcy, so Harper buys both companies and switches the workers with the robots. When he comes back to the earth, he looks much happier than before."

The\nonly meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his\nfist and contemplated the outrage.\n  \n \n  \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n  \n \n  \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with\nthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You\ntry it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I\nhad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready\nto staff my offices with the things!\"\n  \n \n  The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and\ngroaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use\nsome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I\nate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You\nmean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm\nsuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's\nEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth\nmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.\nFactory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they\ncould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in\nfact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,\nhe's about out of business.\"\n  \n \n  Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.\nBut just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a\nhorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third\nrobot enter, wheeling a chair.\n  \n \n  \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing\nwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!\nTake it away!\"\n  \n \n  The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and\nruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither\nbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his\nebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n  \n \n  The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to\nJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take\nme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the\ntreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped\nhim down and marched out with him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver\nof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,\nmechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>  HAGERTY'S ENZYMES\n  \n \n  By A. L. HALEY\n  \n \n \n   There's a place for every man and a man for\n    \n   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the\n    \n   situation was just a little different.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed\ntwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He\nclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner\nfrom jumping.\n  \n \n  \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and\nlet go of everything.\"\n  \n \n  Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And\ngently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated\ntenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n  \n \n  For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge\nhe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously\nstationary sofa.\n  \n \n  \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.\nFranz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a\ntrial?\"\n  \n \n  Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That\nprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for\nweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like\na four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling\nbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely\noutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you\nlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run\nthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's\ncausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd\ncrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n\"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook\nafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged\nman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving\nme to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,\nreasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the\nidiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the\nnew colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.\n\"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk\ntwenty years ago?\"\n  \n \n  Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he\nrasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells\nspewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n  \n \n  His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n  \n \n  \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So many? How?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n  \n \n  \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rebellion?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n  \n \n  They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  \"Any problem posed by one group of\nhuman beings can be resolved by any\nother group.\" That's what the Handbook\nsaid.

Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall....\n  \n \n  \"I've got a good figure,\" she said thoughtfully.\n  \n \n  Max turned at the door. \"Why this sudden interest in your looks?\" he\nasked suspiciously. \"Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally\nget something to eat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute.\" She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully,\nusing a combination from the ship's directory. \"How're you doing, Pat?\"\n  \n \n  The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray. There was a startled\nchuckle. \"Voices, too! Hello, June. How do you tell a machine to go\njump in the lake?\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you hungry?\"\n  \n \n  \"No food since yesterday.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll have a banquet ready for you when you get out,\" she told Pat and\nhung up, smiling. Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which\nmade shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast.\n  \n \n  They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing\nhamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of\nPat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of\nantihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system\nwould treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human\nblood cells, and fight back against them violently.\n  \n \n  One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive,\nso that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human\ncells, and thus succumb more rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked.\n  \n \n  \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently.\n  \n \n  On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a\nviewplate.

The magazine shows a luxurious extraterrestrial hotel in the shape of a circular skyscraper surrounded with lovely pools and gardens. Soon, Harper leaves the house and heads towards the hotel via a rocket with soporific gas on board, which relaxes the passengers. From the rocket, Harper gets to the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel by a tube. Everything is green there, the walls are made from glass, the gardens are framed with arches, and perfectly developed robots are offering various services all around. A robot escorts Harper to his room from the lobby. The room is beautiful and with stunning views. Harper goes up to the restaurant on the roof with the view of the dark blue sky. When he returns to the room, he is taken away by the robots in a wheelchair. This happens every day:  Harper deliberately goes through baths, massages, eating weird food, etc. Then he switches rooms with Jake, puts on his huge clothes, and watches Jack being taken to the procedures.  From there Harper is able to call the elevator and go to the lobby. The lobby is full of guests surprised at Harper's appearance. He is then led to the manager's office through an inconspicuous door.

Under the influence of the\nsoporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the\nfirst time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy\nlethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the\ninterval.\n  \n \n  It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping\nthemselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper\nwas waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of\nthe hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by\npneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n  \n \n  Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,\ngreen-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian\ncopper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a\ndozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n  \n \n  He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high\nstate of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without\nhis knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,\nhe watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in\nwheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial\nduties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n  \n \n  Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the\nexpense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and\nproneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained\noffice staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities\nof these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into\nthe field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly\nhe went over to the desk.\n  \n \n  He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy\nthat was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.\nWonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the\ndesk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a\nrobot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the\nstress of the argument.\n  \n \n  \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what\nyou charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want\none! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you\nhear?\"\n  \n \n  No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.\nThe clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know\nthe hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,\nreally, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.\nAdmit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he\nsmiled at the enraged woman.\n  \n \n  \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is\n   \n   too\n   \n  good.\nI might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want\nsomeone to\n   \n   hear\n   \n  what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once\nin awhile!\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone\nshe can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he\nstepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n  \n \n  \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,\nplease.\" He turned back to the woman.\n  \n \n  But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil\nenough to wait your turn!\"\n  \n \n  Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,\nare always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a\nnormal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned\nauthoritatively to the clerk.\n  \n \n  \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a\nrest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing\nyour\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n  \n \n  The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was\nHarper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's\nimplacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his\nforehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to\ndeposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow\nand another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the\nknees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist\nbanged the counter.\n  \n \n  The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.\nAbsently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the\nirate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n  \n \n  \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a\npallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a\nsilent and efficient robot.\n  \n<doc-sep>Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown\nto the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,\nwaited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered\nfrom deceleration.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally\nopening.\"\n  \n \n  They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They\nwatched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n  \n \n  \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,\nit's amazing! Look at him!\n  \n \n  And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit\nand years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the\nfirst pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n  \n \n  \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it\nagain!\"\n  \n \n  Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out\nHagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got\nboth of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they\ndidn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit\nfor that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to\nyou. All right?\"\n  \n \n  \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human\nafter all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of\nthose robots for office help?

        "Summary_1": "The robots do not make good hotel staff because they are so efficient, they lack any comprehension that humans inherently possess. When Harper first arrives in the hotel, he notices that a woman named Mrs. Jacobsen is giving out about her treatment by the robots. She thinks that the service they provide is too good. She isn't able to change her mind because the robots won't listen, they will just follow orders. They don't listen to Harper when he tries to tell them that he did not book into the hotel for treatment, as they are simply following orders. They don't reason with him when he tries to get out of the treatment, and force him to undergo the procedures. The manager knows that the robots aren't working, and he tells Harper that guest reservations have already declined because of it. ",
        "Summary_2": "The robots are logical and people are not, so the two do not mix. People can't coexist with robots for that reason. Some people want human stuff while in a hotel to shout at, to argue with, to be able to change minds and to hear them out. Moreover, robots are impossible to convince or fight back, so they make the visitors feel like helpless prisoners. If a mistake happens, it's impossible to explain it to the robots. They are even more annoying with their indifference than people are. ",
        "Summary_3": "The robots do not make good hotel staff because they cannot connect to humans emotionally. They do all of the tasks perfectly and quickly, but it is too logical for the current feelings of humans. Many guests are dissatisfied with the service, not from a technical standpoint, but because they cannot change their minds once the initial order has been issued. The robots can also not listen to what any human says, only following what is programmed into them. This is evident in Harper\u2019s experience later, when he insists that the robots do not give him any treatment because he does not need it. However, the robots have taken all of his items and left him with no choice but to comply. On the other hand, Ellis has been requesting treatment since he arrived at the hotel and has received none because the robots were not issued any commands to give him treatment. ",
        "Summary_4": "Robots simply cannot communicate with humans. In the story, Mrs. Jacobsen is angry and asks for a real woman as a nurse instead of a robot. The reason is not because robots did works not good enough, instead, it was because she wanted someone to hear what she says. Also, when robots come into Harper\u2019s room to bring him to the mud-bath. Harper did not have the chance and the ability to talk to robots. They are determined to follow what they are programmed to do. He is forced by robots to stay in stinking mud-baths, and consume weird concoctions. These robots even take away his cloths. His yelling and protests does not work with the robots. Though Harper\u2019s sleep problem is largely improved, and his appetite is much better than before, he feels angry about it because he never wanted it in the first place. "

As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for\nthe opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the\ndesk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n  \n \n  \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots\naround here, have you?\"\n  \n \n  Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots!

I could use\nsome of that treatment right now.

How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm\nsuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's\nEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth\nmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.\nFactory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they\ncould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in\nfact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,\nhe's about out of business.\"\n  \n \n  Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.\nBut just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a\nhorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third\nrobot enter, wheeling a chair.\n  \n \n  \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing\nwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!\nTake it away!\"\n  \n \n  The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and\nruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither\nbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his\nebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n  \n \n  The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to\nJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take\nme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the\ntreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped\nhim down and marched out with him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver\nof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,\nmechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful.

He saw that\nthey were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no\nfurther opportunity to examine them.

His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as\nhe drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,\nat that.\n  \n<doc-sep>Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown\nto the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,\nwaited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered\nfrom deceleration.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally\nopening.\"\n  \n \n  They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They\nwatched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n  \n \n  \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,\nit's amazing! Look at him!\n  \n \n  And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit\nand years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the\nfirst pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n  \n \n  \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it\nagain!\"\n  \n \n  Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out\nHagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got\nboth of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they\ndidn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit\nfor that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to\nyou. All right?\"\n  \n \n  \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human\nafter all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of\nthose robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n  \n \n  Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.\n\"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for\nweeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,\nwaiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He\nturned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of\nstock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,\nhoney?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left\nthe port.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain\nwere the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and\nscheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's\nnervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere\nwith the harmony of his home.\n  \n \n  \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know\nthat those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs\never discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built\nthe largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that\npeople are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,\nyou missed a bet!\"\n  \n \n  Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from\nScribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped\nstructure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock\nof Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular\nskyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,\nother domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the\ndrawing looked lovely and enticing.\n  \n \n  \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went\ntwo years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came\nback in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n  \n \n  Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian\nsprings had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,\nHarp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas\nthey use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of\nfloats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And\nyou can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not\nonly that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking\nbrother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an\nenzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil\ninto its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a\nfortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns\nto process the stuff!\"\n  \n \n  Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The\nmagazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and\ncalculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he\nacknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that\nwas when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed\nentirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that\npoint? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll\ndisfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing\nabout it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,\nwhy don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a\ntantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out\nfor myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual\nlope.\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn\nthat happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge\nsuave lobby.\n  \n \n  He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the\nother visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the\nelevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island\nin a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the\noversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots\nshared his self control.\n  \n \n  The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.\nFrantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.\nWith a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving\ninexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he\nordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n  \n \n  \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he\ncircled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things\nat the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.\nEspecially, card indexes.\n  \n \n  \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get\nit straight again! Stop it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your\nswitchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n  \n \n  With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an\nelectric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became\noddly inanimate.\n  \n \n  \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the\ncollar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across\nthe width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond\nspeech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and\nreturned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at\nthe same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n  \n \n  Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper\nflapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who\nwas busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal\ndesk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good\nman\u2014\" he began.\n  \n \n  \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the\nmanager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could\nstretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper\nS. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I\nhaven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way\ndownstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?\nBecause that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those\ndamnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,\nHarper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a\nsheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n  \n \n  Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic\npattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.\nWith a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \"\n   \n   My\n   \n  robots!\" he muttered.\n\"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n  \n \n  Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you\ndon't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,\nat the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my\nresignation.\"\n  \n \n  Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool\nrobots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix\nthe two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with\nrobots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.\nWe\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.\nAnd it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.\nSo\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n  \n \n  Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he\nhooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and\nreached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I\ndon't know,\" he said mildly.\n  \n \n  Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What\ndo you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,\naren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that\nthese robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even\nmake a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a\nreasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at\nyour establishment.\"\n  \n \n  Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots\nafter what you've seen and experienced?\"\n  \n \n  Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take\ninto consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And\nthere's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm\nwilling to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n  \n \n  With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his\nhead. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll\nback you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.\nBreen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of\nthe hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny\nhand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but\nacross the lobby to the elevator.\n  \n \n  Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the\ntreatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders\ninside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready\nfor the second step of his private Operation Robot.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Headaches,\" Mitchell agreed. \"Everybody has them at some time in his\nlife. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide by\ntheir headaches.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Macklin said.\n  \n \n  \"But think,\" Ferris interjected, \"what a boon it would be if everyone\ncould be cured of headaches\n   \n   forever\n   \n  by one simple injection.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But it\nwould please about everybody else.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscular\npains,\" Mitchell said.\n  \n \n  \"I see. Are you two saying you\n   \n   have\n   \n  such a shot? Can you cure\nheadaches?\"\n  \n \n  \"We think we can,\" Ferris said.\n  \n \n  \"How can you have a specific for a number of different causes?\" Macklin\nasked. \"I know that much about the subject.\"\n  \n \n  \"There\n   \n   are\n   \n  a number of different causes for headaches\u2014nervous\nstrain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors,\nover-indulgence\u2014but there is one\n   \n   effect\n   \n  of all of this, the one real\ncause of headaches,\" Mitchell announced.\n  \n \n  \"We have definitely established this for this first time,\" Ferris added.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. \"And this effect that\nproduces headaches is?\"\n  \n \n  \"The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain,\" Mitchell\nsaid eagerly. \"That is, the constriction of blood vessels in the\ntelencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It's caused by an\nover-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a\nvirus that feeds on pituitrin.\"\n  \n \n  \"That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean\nthe end of the race as well,\" Macklin said. \"In certain areas it is\nvaluable to have a constriction of blood vessels.\"\n  \n \n  \"The virus,\" Ferris explained, \"can easily be localized and stabilized.\nA colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral\nvessels\u2014and only the cerebral vessels\u2014so that the cerebrospinal fluid\ndoesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain.\"\n  \n \n  The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. \"If this really\nworks, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuff\nmakes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than the\nmigraine. How should I go about removing my curse?\" He reinserted the\npipe.\n  \n \n  \"I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate,\" Ferris said. \"Our\ndiscovery will work.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the\nsoporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the\nfirst time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy\nlethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the\ninterval.\n  \n \n  It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping\nthemselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper\nwas waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of\nthe hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by\npneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n  \n \n  Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,\ngreen-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian\ncopper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a\ndozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n  \n \n  He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high\nstate of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without\nhis knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,\nhe watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in\nwheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial\nduties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n  \n \n  Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the\nexpense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and\nproneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained\noffice staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities\nof these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into\nthe field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly\nhe went over to the desk.\n  \n \n  He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy\nthat was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.\nWonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the\ndesk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a\nrobot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the\nstress of the argument.\n  \n \n  \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what\nyou charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want\none! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you\nhear?\"\n  \n \n  No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.\nThe clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know\nthe hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,\nreally, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.\nAdmit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he\nsmiled at the enraged woman.\n  \n \n  \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is\n   \n   too\n   \n  good.\nI might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want\nsomeone to\n   \n   hear\n   \n  what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once\nin awhile!\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone\nshe can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he\nstepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n  \n \n  \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,\nplease.\" He turned back to the woman.\n  \n \n  But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil\nenough to wait your turn!\"\n  \n \n  Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,\nare always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a\nnormal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned\nauthoritatively to the clerk.\n  \n \n  \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a\nrest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing\nyour\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n  \n \n  The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was\nHarper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's\nimplacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his\nforehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to\ndeposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow\nand another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the\nknees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist\nbanged the counter.\n  \n \n  The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.\nAbsently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the\nirate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n  \n \n  \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a\npallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a\nsilent and efficient robot.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Against his will, Harper is subject to a number of treatments at the hotel. He is dunked into mud baths for extensive periods of time. He is held in rancid smelling irradiated hot water. He is made to eat and drink strange concoctions. His stomach is pumped with food. They massage and exercise him. Harper hates all of this. It does do him good though. He notices that his skin which was once yellow, is now returning to a flesh colour. He can finally sleep well again also. When he returns to Earth, he is happy and energised for the first time in years. He looks fitter, and younger than he did before he left. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Harper was planning to simply relax, the hotel was beautiful and his appetite even returned. Due to a mistake he was put on a diet, being forced to eat some weird food and pumped out sometimes. He also goes through various mud baths, exercises, massages, and other tiresome procedures which make him sleep a lot. This resulted in his healthy skin color and appetite returning, but he was tired and angry at his helplessness. Those treatments made him so desperate that Harper switched rooms with another guest, took his huge clothes and went to the lobby to talk to the manager. That also results in his genius business idea and realization that he doesn't want robots around after all. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Harper first goes through a surgery that pumps all of the food he eats out. Then, as the days go by, they take him to a stinking mud-bath and hold him there until he thinks that he is well-done to the bone. After, they soak him in foul, steaming irradiated water until he gags. He is also made to eat and drink weird concoctions under the watch of the robots. Harper also goes through rounds of purging, massaging, and exercise. The robots even take his phone, announcing that he would have no service for two weeks and give him a busy signal. The treatments leave him looking younger, but he is noticeably angrier. His anger and frustration mainly stems from the fact that he did not request any treatment in the first place. Many of these treatments have been done against his own will, and he desperately wants it to stop even though the robots do not listen. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Robots first brought Harper to mud-baths by a wheel chair and held him there until he was well-done. Next, the robots soak him in foul, steaming irradiated water until he gags. Then, they brings concoctions for Harper to eat and drink, and they stands over him until he finishes consuming these concoctions. Lastly, they purge and massage and exercise him. Harper indeed begins to look flesh-colored. He starts to sleep for hours and get a better appetite than before."

        "Article": "There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper\nbleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for\nthe opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the\ndesk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n  \n \n  \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots\naround here, have you?\"\n  \n \n  Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what\nthey did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here\nwhile I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed\nin months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The\nonly meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his\nfist and contemplated the outrage.\n  \n \n  \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n  \n \n  \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with\nthe blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You\ntry it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I\nhad the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready\nto staff my offices with the things!\"\n  \n \n  The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and\ngroaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use\nsome of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I\nate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You\nmean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm\nsuperintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's\nEnzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth\nmentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.\nFactory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they\ncould use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in\nfact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,\nhe's about out of business.\"\n  \n \n  Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.\nBut just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a\nhorrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third\nrobot enter, wheeling a chair.\n  \n \n  \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing\nwrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!\nTake it away!\"\n  \n \n  The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and\nruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither\nbribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his\nebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n  \n \n  The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to\nJake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take\nme, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the\ntreatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped\nhim down and marched out with him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver\nof the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,\nmechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>  HAGERTY'S ENZYMES\n  \n \n  By A. L.

He placed\ntwitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He\nclosed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner\nfrom jumping.\n  \n \n  \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and\nlet go of everything.\"\n  \n \n  Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And\ngently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated\ntenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n  \n \n  For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge\nhe escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously\nstationary sofa.\n  \n \n  \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.\nFranz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a\ntrial?\"\n  \n \n  Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That\nprize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for\nweeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like\na four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling\nbaby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely\noutraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you\nlast year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run\nthe whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's\ncausing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd\ncrack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n  \n \n  Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n\"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook\nafter a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged\nman! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving\nme to a crack-up.

I must pick\ncloser points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but\nfailure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula\nthat is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were\nfilled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\n  \n \n  I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I\nrealized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction\nthat inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there\nimmediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not\naware of the nature of my activities.\n  \n \n  I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I\nstuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered\ninto the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager\nI was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best\ncustomer.\n  \n \n  \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\n  \n \n  I was baffled. What could I tell him?\n  \n \n  \"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're\u2014they're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They're what?\" he wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \"They're not safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not safe?

I knew they were going to blow up!\"\n  \n \n  He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.\nAnother day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning to think like\nthe not-men, curse them.\n  \n \n  Glmpauszn\n  \n<doc-sep>Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain\nwere the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and\nscheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's\nnervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere\nwith the harmony of his home.\n  \n \n  \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know\nthat those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs\never discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built\nthe largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that\npeople are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,\nyou missed a bet!\"\n  \n \n  Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from\nScribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped\nstructure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock\nof Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular\nskyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,\nother domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the\ndrawing looked lovely and enticing.\n  \n \n  \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went\ntwo years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came\nback in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n  \n \n  Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian\nsprings had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,\nHarp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas\nthey use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of\nfloats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And\nyou can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not\nonly that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking\nbrother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an\nenzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil\ninto its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a\nfortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns\nto process the stuff!\"\n  \n \n  Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The\nmagazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and\ncalculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he\nacknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that\nwas when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed\nentirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that\npoint? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll\ndisfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing\nabout it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,\nwhy don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a\ntantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out\nfor myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual\nlope.\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn\nthat happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll\nall work out in time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a\nlittle time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.\nI should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt\nyou terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're\nfrightened.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as\nnecessary. For good if need be.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\n  \n \n  That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since\nreturning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,\neven as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\n  \n \n  \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right\nnow. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I\ndid\u2014seven months ago next Wednesday\u2014he's going to be next. He was\nsmashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost\nready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save\nall they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man\nloses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,\nhe'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and\norgan process\u2014the process that made it all possible. So people have to\nget used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old\nsuperstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of\nus; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\"\n  \n \n  Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please\nbelieve that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and\u2014\" She paused.\n\"There's one question.\"\n  \n \n  He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by\neveryone from the president of the United States on down.\n  \n \n  \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half\nmonths\u2014slept without dreaming.\"\n  \n \n  She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was\nsatisfied.\n  \n \n  Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of\nhow they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and\npulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own\nhome.\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n<doc-sep>There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.\nSomething that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it\nout.\n  \n \n  For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that\nmade him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,\nsince he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking\nmud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he\nwas sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he\ngagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then\nstood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and\nexercised him.\n  \n \n  Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.\nThere was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the\nphone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two\nweeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n  \n \n  \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned\nhis back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look\nflesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become\naccustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for\nhours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an\nappetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they\nsent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he\ncould wake up enough to be.\n  \n \n  He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,\nstill moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily\ninformed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.\nAfter I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't\nfind any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the\nelevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a\nman or he's stuck.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait\nany longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been\nthinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when\nthat assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled\nand gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room\nand I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what\nhappens?\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll\nget my clothes.\"\n  \n \n  Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n  \n \n  Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?\nI'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have\nto go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n  \n \n  Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe\nyou could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's\nokay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in\nthat fancy lobby.\"\n  \n \n  Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots\nwill be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm\nsure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't\nworry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n  \n \n  Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room\nhe watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for\nhis first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's\nclothing.\n  \n \n  The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's\nclothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking\nup on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was\nshoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number\ntwelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from\nhis image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.\n\"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for\nme. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n  \n \n  He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the\nrobot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to\nthe elevator.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Go ahead and eat it. It just wouldn't digest.

Till then\nyou'd starve to death on a full stomach.\"\n  \n \n  Pat's side of the table had been loaded with the dishes from two trays,\nbut it was almost clear now and the dishes were stacked neatly to one\nside. He started on three desserts, thoughtfully tasting each in turn.\n  \n \n  \"Test-tube evolution?\" Max repeated. \"What's that? I thought you people\nhad no doctors.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a story.\" Pat leaned back again. \"Alexander P.

Smith details the tale of a race on the brink of extinction and their strange attempt to save themselves. Snaddra is a rainy planet with a mud surface. Due to the harsh weather, the Snaddrath chose to build their cities underground. Their civilized culture allowed for excellence in the metal industry and architecture, however, their isolation caused for poor education and expensive trade deals. In the face of crisis, the Bbulas Plan emerged, a plot to move their capital aboveground to convince visiting Terrans of their primitive nature and need for help. \nIt begins with Skirru, an architect-turned-beggar, arguing with his former fiance, Larhgan, who is now the High Priestess. Their new jobs forbid marriage between the two, so Larhgan returns his grimpatch with regret. Bbulas, the new High Priest, watches gleefully, as he was in love with Larhgan all along. After much fighting, they levitate to the surface of the planet and wait for the Terrans to arrive. Now covered with huts, the new caste system emerges. Skirru is upset about his current position and feels ill. The woven metal clothes he was given to wear did not shield him from the light, so his green skin starts fading to yellow. \nThe Terrans arrive, Raoul and Cyril, to analyze the planet. Skirru begs in front of them, and they give him a chocolate bar, a delicacy on Snaddra. He eats it quickly, grateful for the treat as it restores health to sick Snaddrath. He remembers a pair of shoes he once got and dashes belowground to get them, returning with booted feet. Able to walk easier now, he follows the Terrans to the temple, where Bbulas and Larhgan are waiting. \nRaoul eyes the female Snaddrath hungrily. Cyril reminds him that they are there to investigate, not fraternize with the natives. Once there, Larhgan welcomes them with a long speech Bbulas wrote. Bbulas invites the Terrans to a rain dance, which they laugh at seeing as the planet is covered in mud. Bbulas recovers quickly and claims it\u2019s a ceremony to stop the rain. Already, his plot to save his planet is falling apart. Raoul quickly notices that the beggar, Skkiru, is wearing mudshoes, which makes no sense. \nBbulas changes the subject and points them towards their hut, evidently the nicest one on Snaddra. He runs to Skkiru and angrily confronts him about his footwear. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\n\tThe beings of Snaddra are hosting two Terrans who are coming to study their culture. The interest of the Terrans is extremely important because the planet\u2019s population and natural resources are wasting away; they need the attention and resources that an anthropological study can provide. Bbulas, the Planetary Diletantte went to a Terran university on another planet after being selected for his highest intelligence score in the group tested with him. As Diletantte, he has been called upon to help solve the planet\u2019s dilemma of saving itself. His plan, accepted because there were no better plans, involves restructuring the society and culture of the planet into one that he says the Terran anthropologists will find more intriguing than their real culture. He explains that this is because Terrans are most interested in societies that are different from their own, rather than like their own as Snaddrath really society is. He uses lots to assign roles in the society and ends up as the high priest, and the high priestess is Larhgan, a female he has been interested in for a long time but who was engaged to Skkiru. Skkiru has drawn the lot of a beggar and can no longer be engaged to Larhgan, and at the beginning of the story, he finds out that the changes Bbulas has instituted are actually going to be permanent. Bbulas threatens to make Skkiru a metal worker, the lowest position in the social hierarchy, if he doesn\u2019t cooperate. Larhgan is sad that she will not be able to marry Skkiru and says she will not marry anyone at all but just devote her life to religion. \n\tWhen the Earth ship arrives with the Terrans, everyone goes to the surface to welcome them even though it is cold and raining. There is a reminder for everyone except beggars to wear shoes. They hold a welcoming ceremony, and the Terrans notice Skkiru, the beggar, so he begs from them. They aren\u2019t sure what to give him, so they give him chocolate which is a real treat because Bbulas has closed all the chocolate shops. One Terran, Raoul, notices how beautiful Larhgan is, and the other, Cyril, reminds him they cannot establish friendships with the native females because it would prevent them from being objective. The Terrans thank the Shadds for their welcome and tell them they hope their stay will be pleasant and profitable. They intend to study the Shadds without doing anything to disturb their culture.\n\tThe Shadds desperately need the Terrans\u2019 interest. The Shadds\u2019 natural resources are nearly depleted, and their population is decreasing. The culture is getting close to being unsustainable. It can grow rice and catch fish but has to purchase all other food and fiber products from other planets, which is very expensive. Shadd doesn\u2019t attract any tourists, so they are banking on the Terrans to help.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Skkiru, who was once a great architect of Snaddra, must now pretend to be a beggar. His fiance, Larhgan, will play the role of High Priestess, and she must separate herself from him. In this make-believe world created by Bbulas, the Planetary Dilettante, the couple will never be able to see each other again. Bbulas has given out roles to each citizen of Snaddra, and the entire planet is depending on the scheme. Two anthropologists from Terran (Earth) have been invited to research the fake society in hopes that their attention will bring good fortune. Snaddra\u2019s various life forms are nearing extinction, and they have few natural resources left. The planet is not attractive to tourists, and it\u2019s too far out of the way to make trade routes profitable. \n\nSkkiru blames Bbulas for his breakup with Larhgran. Bbulas has always had feelings for Larhgan, so Skirru believes he put them in different castes on purpose. Bbula defends his choices as necessary for society\u2019s survival, and Larhgan agrees. She loves Skkiru, but she cannot put her own relationship before her people. \n\nSkkiru hates the Terrans and has zero interest in living above ground like they do. He has never stepped foot on the surface of Snaddra, but everyone is being forced above ground. The Terrans\u2019 ship comes into view, and everyone rushes to put shoes on. Although beggars are not allowed to wear shoes, Skkiru puts some on anyway. The underground city must be kept a secret from the Terrans. Bbulas\u2019s plan involves looking primitive in order to gain sympathy.\n\nSkkiru is instructed to go to the field and look hungry. Two Terrans, Raoul and Cyril, leave their ship and approach a group of Snaddrath dressed in costumes singing songs. As soon as Raoul sees the female Snaddraths, Cyril sees a change in his face, and warns him that they must maintain objectivity. Then, Raoul and Cyril point their attention towards Skkiru. They would like to offer the poor beggar man something, but they\u2019re not sure what. Raoul suggests a chocolate bar, and Skkiru eagerly accepts. His joy is fleeting, however, when he lays eyes on Larhgan, standing in her beautiful high priestess outfit, welcoming the Terrans with a speech written by Bbulas. He has never felt so lowly in his life. Skkiru hopes that he will have a chance to make something of himself and demonstrate his worthiness to Larhgan. The Terrans are infatuated with romance, after all. \n\nThe Terrans thank the Snaddrath for welcoming them, and they learn that they are invited to view a rain dance. Raoul questions why the Snaddrath would ever want more rain when it\u2019s already muddy, and Bbulas changes the plan and explains that the rain dance is to make the rain stop. When Raoul and Cyril are led to their huts, Bbulas finds Skkiru and yells at him for putting on shoes. He reminds Skkiru to let him do all of the thinking. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins in the middle of a discussion amongst Bbulas, Larhgan, and Skkiru. The three are Snaddrath of the planet Snaddra, and were preparing for the arrival of Terrans. Skkiru is upset; he is a beggar, but only by Bbulas' design: the society had been restructured to be more primitive for the sake of the eyes of the Terrans. Skkiru had been engaged to Larhgan, who would now serve as high priestess, but this difference in social status meant they could no longer be affiliated. They discuss some of the confusion and issues surrounding the plan, and all head outside when they hear the announcement that the Earthmen had arrived. It turned out that the Snaddrath lived in underground cities, but built some buildings above-ground where they would convince the Earthmen they actually lived. When they got to the surface, they saw the procession greeting the visitors, and started trying to navigate the huge amounts of mud on the surface. The Snaddrath could self-levitate, but didn't want to give this ability away so they made slow progress walking. Skkiru ran off to find his mud-shoes, and met everyone else at the ship. The Earthmen (the cultural ruling race) were talking about previous situations on other planets, not knowing that the Snaddrath could actually understand them. They offer Skkiru some chocolate, which he takes (it increases the body's resistance to weather, and was a delicacy). As this continues, Skkiru reflected on the rapid loss of population and resources on the planet and how the Terran visit has affected his planet. For instance, metal-working was the largest industry, so Bbulas made them the lowest caste when reorganizing the society, which Skkiru thought was an easy way out of a chance to be more creative. Eventually interacting with Larhgan, the Terrans express gratitude for the welcome they have received and expresses interest in learning from the Snaddrath, enjoying their stay, and to not affect the society as much as possible. Skkiru found humor in this, as the presence of the Earthmen is the only reason their society is structured the way it is currently. The Terrans are invited to a raindance, which confuses them, until Bbulas catches himself and says it's to stop the rain, not to get more. Skkiru continued to reflect: he hadn\u2019t been able to live well and to save, so he didn't have savings. He was willing to play this game to avoid discovery of the truth by the Earthmen, with the careful systems of tabus to keep the visitors from discovering the underground cities, in part because he didn't want to leave Larhgan. The story ends with Bbulas yelling at Skkiru for having retrieved mudshoes and tells him not to think. "

Soften them up, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n  \n \n  \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,\nwell, it's all in the day's work.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with\na polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming\nprocession\u2014\n   \n   creatures indeed\n   \n  ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.\n\"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would\nbe indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially\nsince this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the\nshoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n  \n \n  Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of\nBbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which\nhad always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent\nlife-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it\nwasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n  \n \n  \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with\nan appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the\nprocessional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some\nslight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three\neyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my\nfavorite color.\"\n  \n \n \n   If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn\nbright yellow.\n   \n  His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal\nhealthy emerald to a sickly celadon.\n  \n<doc-sep>Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion\nof his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere.\n   \n   Maybe the\nlittle one's a robot!\n   \n  However, it couldn't be\u2014a robot would be better\nconstructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n  \n \n  \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport\nwith the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n  \n \n  Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap\nsomething for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of\nexchange here?\"\n  \n \n \n   Money\n   \n  , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this\npiece of information, helpful though it would be.\n  \n \n  \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.\n\"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be\na universal one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable\u2014and entirely genuine\u2014murmurs\nof gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the\nplanet's delicacy shops\u2014and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate\nwere to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift\nto contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his\nrocker.\n  \n \n  To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession,\nSkkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's\nresistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much\nweather all at once.\n  \n \n  On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they\noften sickened of it and passed on\u2014which helped to solve the problem\nof birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed\nno such measures, for its population\u2014like its natural resources\u2014was\ndwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the\nchocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than\nto descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival.\n  \n<doc-sep>She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we\nwere honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and\nwe are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n  \n \n  The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on,\napparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n  \n \n  \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and\nprofit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive\nanalysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study\nyour society, not to tamper with it in any way.\"\n  \n \n \n   Ha, ha\n   \n  , Skkiru said to himself.\n   \n   Ha, ha, ha!\n   \n \n \n  \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of\nthe corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've\nestablished rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts\nto feel sorry for the man.\n  \n \n  \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with\ngreat self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small\nbut unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We\nhope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the\nthroat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now,\nbut the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he\nadded hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not\nattractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color,\nsuch aroma!\"\n  \n \n  Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing\nas mud....\"\n  \n \n  The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable\nTerrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a\ndance to bring on rain. It is a dance to\n   \n   stop\n   \n  rain.\"\n  \n \n  He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However,\nthat was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability.\nIn the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for\nthe improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than\nthis high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned\nthe various roles so that each person would be making a definite\ncontribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums,\nlike the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n  \n \n  What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing\naround begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg?\nOnly the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw\nthemselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried\naway that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been\naccustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n  \n \n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n   \n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n  \n \n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time.

He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain.

I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders\nraking up things.

        "Summary_1": "The visiting Terrans, Cyril and Raoul, are visiting Snaddra to survey and analyze the native culture. Evidently, Terrans do this on planets across the universe, immersing themselves in the culture only to leave however many days, months, or years later with a full-fledged report. Their visit is significant because it may give the Snaddrath a chance to revitalize their economy and people. Due to their current lack of resources, muddy surface, and planetary isolation, the Snaddrath are facing extinction. They hope that by presenting themselves as a primitive civilization, the Terrans will be more inclined to establish trade with them and give them an economic boost. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Terran visit is of great significance to the Snaddrans. The Snaddran population is dying, and most of its resources are depleted. So Snaddra needs Terrans to be interested in their planet and civilization in order to secure assistance that will help them survive. The Terran anthropologists are coming to Snaddra to study the culture and ways of life of the natives. Bbulas believes that the Terrans will not be interested in the Snaddrans\u2019 real society because it is too much like their own; therefore, he has orchestrated a plan that completely changes the society and the way they live in hopes of attracting the interest of the Earthmen who are visiting. The Terrans, on the other hand, believe that they will enjoy their stay and profit from their study of the Snaddrans and claim they can do so without disturbing their culture. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Terrans are on Snaddra to get a better understanding of the planet\u2019s culture. Raoul and Cyril are anthropologists, and they have previously studied primitive cultures on other planets. They are not interested in studying societies that are very similar to their own. Instead, they prefer to look at cultures that are less advanced than the Terrans\u2019. \n\nThe Terrans came to Snaddra after they were invited by Bbulas. Bbulas is the Planetary Dilettante, and he has been tasked with the difficult job of saving the planet. Snaddra is struggling without resources and no way of attracting tourists. Rice is the only vegetable that will grow there. Bbulas\u2019s plan is to hide the Snaddrath\u2019s underground cities and force the citizens to play roles in a caste system. They hide their technology and wear costumes and make up ceremonies in order to give the Terrans what Bbulas believes they want to see. Raoul and Cyril promise to be objective observers who do not meddle in the Snaddrath\u2019s daily routines. \n\nBbulas has prepared for the Terrans\u2019 visit by building a hut for them and forcing some of the citizens to learn a rain dance. When Raoul questions why they would ever want more rain because it\u2019s already very wet and muddy outside, Bbulas thinks quickly and explains that the rain dance has the power to make the rain stop. In truth, the Snaddrath have never lived on the surface of the planet, so they understand very little about weather patterns. \n",
        "Summary_4": "\nThe Terrans are visiting Snaddra as part of a research mission. They are the \"cultural ruling race\", which means they have a lot of social influence in the sector, but they have not learned from many of the other races in the area. They want to enjoy their stay but also to gain something from it, but are careful to note that they have to be cautious in their relationships with the women who are native to the planet. It was apparently a long journey for them, and quite an expensive one at that, so they hope to make the most of their stay, even though they are not aware that they have walked into a fake version of the society they intend to study. They do not intend to affect the society they are visiting, but do not realize that they have done so in large ways already: in cultural influence, exports, and rice as a plant grown there to begin with. Perhaps one of the biggest influences is that of the restructuring of part of the Snaddrath society so that the Snaddrath think they will be more appealing to the Terrans as a focus of study. "

        "Article": "The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly\npasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae\ndistinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath.

A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on\nliving at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but\nthe welfare of our planet comes first.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already\ngilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked\npretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his\nown appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight\nromantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most\nhardened sadist.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of\nthe city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n  \n \n  \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was\nwrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n  \n \n  That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it\nanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate\nhis mind that school-days were long since over.\n  \n \n  \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like\nthe Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected\nweariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;\nit is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the\nother\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty\nchoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they\nwant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look\nhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n  \n \n  \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart\nin a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed\nto indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain\nessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than\nin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial\ninfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been\nsuch a nice girl, too.\n  \n \n  \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a\nlong, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering\ntoes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and\nI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with\nBbulas.\"\n  \n \n  \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the\nfield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal\nhabits and customs, and I'll even\n   \n   beg\n   \n  . But I don't have to like doing\nit, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n  \n \n  All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,\nSkkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n  \n \n  Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a\ntriple silence.\n  \n<doc-sep>He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of\nOriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe\nI shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look\naltogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n  \n \n  His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely\nunjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much\nhistory since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by\nPan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European\nor Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be\ncursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but\none of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is\nLassisi Swarts.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n  \n \n  \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might\nhave been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals\neventually conquered all the world, except for North America\u2014the\nlast remnant of the American World Empire\u2014and southern Africa. The\nAfrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and\nthey had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They\nhad a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified\nof being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and\nit was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.\nThat went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So many? How?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies\nof them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot\nfactories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little\nshudder.\n  \n \n  \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons\nof the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot\nproduction system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands\nraising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,\neither, before the population was\u2014reduced to three hundred million.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>For several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\n  \n \n  Kane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n  \n \n  \"Whiskey!\"\n  \n \n  \"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\n  \n \n  I selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\n  \n \n  We drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n  \n \n  \"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n  \n \n  \"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\n  \n \n  Kane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\n  \n \n  It took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\n  \n \n  After I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\n  \n \n  I tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\n  \n \n  Solution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\n  \n \n  I wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\n  \n \n  They had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\n  \n \n  The aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\n   \n   And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\n  \n \n  The man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n  \n \n  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n  \n \n  \"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n  \n \n  \"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n  \n \n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n   \n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n  \n \n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you come from the future?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n  \n \n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n  \n \n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n  \n \n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n  \n \n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n  \n \n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n  \n \n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n  \n \n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n  \n \n  \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are? Look around.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n  \n \n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n  \n \n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n  \n \n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n  \n \n  Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n  \n \n  Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n  \n \n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n  \n \n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n  \n \n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n  \n \n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n  \n \n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n  \n \n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n  \n \n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n  \n \n  Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n  \n \n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n  \n \n  The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n  \n \n  She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n  \n \n  Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\n  \n<doc-sep>The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n  \n \n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The natives of Snaddra are a very civilized race, progressing beyond what life on Earth is like now. They live underground, due to the terrible weather on the surface of the planet, and have built extensive cities and tunnels. They designed flying cars to use on the surface, and they have the capability to levitate. \nTheir outward appearance is somewhat humanoid, though there are some very distinct and different features. For one, the natives have antennae, as well as green skin. When healthy, their skin is a beautiful emerald green color, but if they grow ill it will become more yellow. The Snaddrath also have three eyes, requiring spectacles to have three individual lenses. When upset, anxious, or provoked, they have a tendency to twirl mid-air. If a Snaddrath falls in love with another, they give their lover their grimpatch, a beautiful bauble, to indicate their dedication. Many Snaddrath work in the metal industry since some of the few resources left on the planet are minerals. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The natives of Snaddra look very much like humans, except they have antennae, three eyes, and earflaps that they can open and close. Snaddrans have two hearts, and their essential organs are placed differently from humans\u2019. They speak Snadd but also learn English as their third language. They are intelligent and civilized, with a president, parliament, and a local university. When upset, they turn a triple somersault in the air and coil their antennae to insult another Snaddran. They can move by floating or self-levitating. Snaddrans form relationships much the same way that humans do, falling in love and marrying. They have emotions including love, sadness, jealousy, and pride.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The natives of Snaddra are under great stress. They are deeply concerned about their survival and are willing to do almost anything in order to save themselves. The creatures live underground and have never been to the surface of the planet. However, Bbulas\u2019s plan involves proving to the Terrans that they are a primitive population with very little going for them, so they create a less advanced society above ground. Bbulas actually wears contact lenses, but in the new down-and-out society he has created, he cannot be seen wearing them. He must put on glasses in order to convince the Terrans that Snaddra is not a place of great wealth. All of the citizens are forced to dress in carefully crafted rags by society\u2019s most notable tailor, and the costumes are deeply uncomfortable in the rain and wind on the surface of the planet. This is especially true since the people have never been exposed to the elements before. Bbulas, however, wears warm underskirts under his robes. He believes it\u2019s important to keep imports like certain types of clothes secret from the Terrans. \n\nThe Snaddraths do not actually live in huts, but Bbulas had some built in order to convince the Terrans that they have very little technology and are in need of more advanced peoples to teach them their ways. \n\nAt one point, Skkiru remembers that the libel laws in Snaddra are very severe, so he can not openly criticize Bbula or his master plan without facing severe punishment. The planet\u2019s government has a very top-down approach to ruling. The parliament selected Bbulas to be the only person in his generation to get a Terran education on another planet, and they have left the survival of Snaddra completely up to himi. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The natives of Snaddra are an advanced species who live in underground cities on a planet whose surface is extremely muddy and rainy. They have antennae, three eyes, and emerald green skin which becomes more pale if they are sick or malnourished. They are humanoid but have their organs in different places from Terrans. They have interesting reactions to food, such as chocolate helping provide resistance to weather. They are able to levitate on their own, but also have developed technology like air-cars and spaceships, and fourth-dimensional reflectors that can serve as walls. We know that they are an advanced species despite what the Terrestrians encounter because the Snaddrath have re-invented their society to be more primitive than they actually are. The reasoning behind this is that they want the Earthmen to take an interest in them, but if most civilized societies are about the same, they have to be a more primitive society for the Earthmen to care enough to want to learn more. The primary trade on the planet is metal work, and the lack of natural resources means that the Snaddrath have to rely heavily on trade with other planets in the system, especially for things like fabric. It is not only the level of resources that is dwindling, but the population as well. They have strong education systems of their own, and easy access to library resources, but they send one person per generation off-world to get a Terran education. The Snaddrath are considered more emotionally driven than humans, at least in that the focus of their education does not include as much on emotional regulation, so there are visible temperament differences between these groups."

        "Article": " \n  The Ignoble Savages\n  \n \n  By EVELYN E.

Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem\nto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.\nIt's forever.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to\nkeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way\nLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when\nshe said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and\napprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n  \n \n  \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other\nagain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you\nmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.\n\"Bbulas, this is your fault!

A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on\nliving at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but\nthe welfare of our planet comes first.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly\npasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae\ndistinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much\nas the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n  \n \n  In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms,\nentirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow\nexpected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had\nfrequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those\ncould be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had\nalways understood, who had invented the art of retouching\u2014thus proving\nbeyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran\u2014which\nthe Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to\nunderstand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable\nthird language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen\none since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on\nthat little planet in the Arcturus system\u2014what was its name? Glotch,\nthat's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more\nthan a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to\namass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried\nto eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully\nthat it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How\nhorrible!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human\u2014another\nspecies entirely\u2014so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it\nwas quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral\nconsiderations seemed less important to us than self-preservation\njust then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the\nmissionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the missionaries\u2014did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n  \n \n  \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah,\nwell, it's all in the day's work.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with\na polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming\nprocession\u2014\n   \n   creatures indeed\n   \n  ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.\n\"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would\nbe indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially\nsince this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the\nshoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n  \n \n  Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of\nBbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials\u2014which\nhad always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent\nlife-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it\nwasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n  \n \n  \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with\nan appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the\nprocessional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some\nslight differences, of course\u2014but, if two eyes are beautiful, three\neyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my\nfavorite color.\"\n  \n \n \n   If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn\nbright yellow.\n   \n  His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal\nhealthy emerald to a sickly celadon.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already\ngilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked\npretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his\nown appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight\nromantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most\nhardened sadist.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of\nthe city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n  \n \n  \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was\nwrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n  \n \n  That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it\nanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate\nhis mind that school-days were long since over.\n  \n \n  \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like\nthe Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected\nweariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;\nit is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the\nother\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty\nchoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they\nwant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look\nhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n  \n \n  \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart\nin a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed\nto indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain\nessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than\nin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial\ninfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been\nsuch a nice girl, too.\n  \n \n  \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a\nlong, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering\ntoes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and\nI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with\nBbulas.\"\n  \n \n  \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the\nfield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal\nhabits and customs, and I'll even\n   \n   beg\n   \n  . But I don't have to like doing\nit, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n  \n \n  All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,\nSkkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n  \n \n  Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a\ntriple silence.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the\nfeasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies.

What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of\nthing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually\nidentical, except for the personal touches each individual has given\nhis ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as\nthough these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set\nof toy sailboats!\"\n  \n \n  Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can\nsee that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n  \n \n  \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll\nkindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer\nthe matter to committee.\"\n  \n \n  \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss\nhaving a cosy chat.\"\n  \n \n  There was a pause.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ...

A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set\ncompound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees.\nBehind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien rasped.\n  \n \n  \"Who's your friend, Captain?\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien said again.\n  \n \n  \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I've seen it.

It looks brittle, and\nI'm tempted to test it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those\nsnappers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Last chance,\" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch\nfrom Retief's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Show him your papers, you damned fool,\" the captain said hoarsely. \"I\ngot no control over Skaw.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine\nglass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like\nto fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as\nQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush\nthings?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of\ngovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n  \n \n  \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt.

Anyway, with\nthe new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\nThe Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize\ninto Verpp\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become\nwarmongers like Qorn?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old\nsaying goes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What\nabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to\nsit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing\noff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But\nwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you\nTerrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what\nyour strength was.\"\n  \n \n  \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've\nhad diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're\nQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if\nhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other\nCenters\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is\ndefinitely on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could\nname some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal\nhere....\"\n  \n \n \n  V\n  \n \n  At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retief\nand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDT\nSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,\nflying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" Magnan commented. \"I wonder what the significance of the\nwhite ensign might be?\"\n  \n \n  Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong\u2014and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the\ninvasion\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\n  \n \n  The man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n  \n \n  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n  \n \n  \"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n  \n \n  \"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n  \n \n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n   \n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n  \n \n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you come from the future?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n  \n \n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Snaddra is a planet leagues away from many other solar systems. Its isolation and general lack of resources has left the planet as a whole in a terrible situation. Snaddra has two seasons: wet and wetter season. Raining practically every day, the surface of the planet is covered in mud. Because of the muddy surface and difficult weather, the Snaddrath have built cities underground and truly thrived there. Skkiru, one of the main characters, is an architect, and supposedly helped to build underground buildings and cities. Their futuristic lifestyle is threatened, however, by a lack of resources. The only crop that can grow on Snaddra is rice, brought in by Terrans, and much of the native animals and fish are dying out. The one commodity and resource left is minerals. However, the constant importation of foreign goods depleted their economy, leaving the Snaddrath between a rock and a hard place. \nBbulas, the Planetary Dilettante, developed the Bbulas Plan to save Snaddra from ruin. He designed a whole aboveground world, new garbs for citizens, as well as an entirely new culture. He believes, as does most of Snaddra, that a primitive culture will draw Terrans in more than an equally advanced and civilized one. So, the story mostly takes place on the surface of Snaddra, now covered in huts. \n",
        "Summary_2": "On Snaddra, it rains almost all the time, and the surface is covered with thick, deep, murky mud. The temperature is uncomfortably cool. They have advanced technology in their air-cars. In addition to a president and parliament, the natives have a Planetary Dilettante. This civil-service position is filled by a Snaddran who has the highest intelligence score on a competitive examination. The winner attends university on Gambrell, which is the nearest planet with a Terran League University, to receive a Terran education. This is so expensive that only one person per generation can be awarded this opportunity. The Diletantte\u2019s role is to help the planet in times of emergency. Presumably, the Diletantte\u2019s superior intellect and education enable him to determine the best ways to handle the emergencies that arise. Snaddrans live underground, perhaps because of the unpleasant conditions on the planet\u2019s surface where it rains almost constantly, and the ground is all mud. Snaddra\u2019s population and natural resources are quickly dwindling, and its main natural resource has been minerals. Life forms on the planet are on the verge of extinction, and the only food the planet produces is fish and rice. Other foods and materials must be imported from other planets, which is extremely expensive because Snaddra is not located along direct trade routes. The planet also doesn\u2019t attract tourists. The society has just been transformed in preparation for the arrival of the Terrans who want to study them. Now the society features a high priest and priestess. All the metal workers have been made outcasts, and beggars are just slightly higher than the metal workers. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Snaddra, the planet where the story takes place, is in deep trouble. The Snaddrath who live underground, are forced to take a chance on the Planetary Dilettante\u2019s plan to save the society. \nThe population of Snaddra is decreasing rapidly, there are almost zero natural resources left, and creatures from other planets are not interested in visiting Snaddra for tourism or trading purposes. Food and other resources have to be purchased from other planets, and that is a highly expensive endeavor. Metal-working is the most important industry they have, yet metal-workers are looked at as the lowliest of the Snaddraths. Instead of being thankful for their hardest and most important workers, they treat them very poorly. \n\nWhen Raoul offers Skkiru a chocolate bar, he happily accepts the gift. This is because chocolate is only available in very expensive shops, and Skkiru has had very few opportunities to taste the delicacy. \n\nThe surface of Snaddra is virtually untouched because all of society lives in underground cities. When the citizens embark on their new mission to convince the Terran that they live primitive lives on the surface, they are wholly unprepared to deal with the rainy and windy weather. The nonstop precipitation means that everyone is standing in mud, and their costumes do not adequately protect them from the harsh conditions. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Snaddra is a muddy and rainy planet with limited natural resources, and a race of people who live in underground cities. There is so much mud that neither the Terrans nor the Snaddrath can move very quickly on the surface. The depleting resources of the planet means that there are only a few things that can grow on the surface, rice and fish. Rice is itself an import from Earth, and a lot of resources are acquired through trade. The Snaddrath people live in underground cities, but they have erected buildings on the surface as well for the sake of their plan to convince the Earthmen of their facade. "

        "Article": "The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service\njob, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to\nthe person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general\ngloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring\nsense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm\u2014and there, Skkiru felt,\nwas where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test\nwould have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n  \n \n  The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran\nLeague University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No\nindividual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how\ngreat his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so\nimmense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason\nwhy only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at\nthe planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the\npopulation.\n  \n \n  The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve\nthe planet when an emergency came\u2014and this, old Luccar, the former\nPresident, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the\nfact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had,\nafter considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method\nof saving Snaddra\u2014and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last,\nhad come up with this program.\n  \n \n  It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he\nfelt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the\nBbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath,\nlargely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and,\nas a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the\nstatus of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of\nthe planet, there was no choice.\n  \n \n  But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his\nanthropological viewings\u2014though Bbulas might have been the only one\nprivileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was\nnot the only one who could use a library\u2014seen accounts of societies\nwhere beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in\nlife? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive\nsociety Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru\nshould not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy\nof the high priestess's hand\u2014which would be entirely in the Terran\nprimitive tradition of romance.\n  \n \n  \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were\nout of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are\nthose ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some\nold pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of\ncollecting junk and I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave\nall the thinking to me!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already\ngilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked\npretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his\nown appearance\u2014which was, although picturesque enough to delight\nromantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most\nhardened sadist.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of\nthe city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n  \n \n  \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was\nwrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n  \n \n  That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it\nanyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate\nhis mind that school-days were long since over.\n  \n \n  \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like\nthe Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected\nweariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar;\nit is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the\nother\u2014and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty\nchoosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they\nwant. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look\nhungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n  \n \n  \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart\nin a gesture which, though devout on Earth\u2014or so the fictapes seemed\nto indicate\u2014was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain\nessential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than\nin the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial\ninfluence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been\nsuch a nice girl, too.\n  \n \n  \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a\nlong, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering\ntoes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me\u2014and\nI hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with\nBbulas.\"\n  \n \n  \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the\nfield, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal\nhabits and customs, and I'll even\n   \n   beg\n   \n  . But I don't have to like doing\nit, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n  \n \n  All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you,\nSkkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n  \n \n  Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a\ntriple silence.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  The Ignoble Savages\n  \n \n  By EVELYN E. SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by DILLON\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Snaddra had but one choice in its fight\n    \n   to afford to live belowground\u2014underhandedly\n    \n   pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.\n\"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru\nprotested.\n  \n \n  \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she\nexclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem\nto realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours.\nIt's forever.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to\nkeep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way\nLarhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when\nshe said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and\napprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n  \n \n  \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other\nagain, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you\nmay be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.\n\"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n  \n \n  There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face\u2014an obviously insincere\nregret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had\nalways felt about the girl.\n  \n \n  \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood.\nThis is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are\nadopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on\nliving at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but\nthe welfare of our planet comes first.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small,\nmomentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks.\nFor one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously\nupon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple\u2014a ramshackle\naffair, but then it had been run up in only three days\u2014where the\nofficial reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that,\nbecause of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from\novershooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at\nhim\u2014and not only for his forwardness\u2014that was in character on both\nsides, too.\n  \n \n  Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no\nmatter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he\nwasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand\nsegregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising\u2014a poetic\nthought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars\nwere often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since\nmetal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the\nplanet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the\neasy way out.\n  \n \n  Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high\npriest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were\nvolcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the\nwind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the\nsnug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were\nmetal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially\nvisible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the\nplanet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the\nSnaddrath depended upon imports.\n  \n \n  As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas\nat the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although\nSkkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made\nthe emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing\nthere, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers\nwelcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by\nBbulas\u2014who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker,\nfor there was no end to the man's conceit.\n  \n \n  The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable\nrags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf\nthat had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short\nlife, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so\nlovely and so remote.\n  \n \n  \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was\nsaying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our\nhearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and\nwith love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here\nas you did on Nemeth....\"\n  \n \n  Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in\ncontemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much\nattention to the expression on his companion's face.\n  \n \n  \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of\nthe Galaxy.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished\nfour-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber.\n  \n \n \n   Kismet\n   \n  , Skkiru muttered to himself,\n   \n   and a little sleight of hand.\n   \n  But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of\nSnaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I\nsuppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the\nground during the day, like\u2014like savages.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n  \n \n  \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh,\n   \n   pooh\n   \n  , POOH!\"\n  \n \n  Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n  \n \n  \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at\nSkkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have\nanother drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I can't work metal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other\noutcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a\ntrade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd\nbetter give you back your grimpatch\u2014\" Larhgan handed the glittering\nbauble to him\u2014\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any\nlonger, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru\nyelled, twirling madly in the air.\n  \n \n  \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not\nthink I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career.\nAre there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n  \n \n  \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if\nyou keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a\ntrait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly\nwith the high priestess's robes.\"\n  \n \n  Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart\nfrom mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy,\neven though my heart will be breaking.\"\n  \n \n  It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the\nwhole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's\nproblem. \"Listen\u2014\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered\ndown from overhead. It was too late.\n  \n \n  \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.\n\"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n  \n \n  Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had\nmade him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled\nhim both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been\nso drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death.\nIt gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral,\nalthough, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have\nto arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's\npatriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die\nfor his planet in many ways\u2014but wantonly starving to death as the\nresult of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n  \n \n  All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off\nto the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for\none of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist\nmiserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The\ncapital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow\nsuit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep\nthe Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n  \n \n  He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of\nthem, and stave off his doom for a while\u2014but that would not be playing\nthe game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n  \n \n  As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which\nstruck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed\nto help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that\nthemselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put\nout centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired\nfrom a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far\ntoo high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and\nmuch more cheaply.\n  \n \n  It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had\nbeen forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life.\nWhat resources it once possessed had been depleted and\u2014aside from\nminerals\u2014they had never been very extensive to begin with. All\nlife-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and\nrice\u2014the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a\nTerran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the\nother planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of\nthe direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist\nbusiness.\n  \n \n  Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay\naltogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. \"I haven't finished eating. Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\n  \n \n  The man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n  \n \n  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n  \n \n  \"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n  \n \n  \"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n  \n \n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n   \n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n  \n \n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you come from the future?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n  \n \n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the\nlibrary, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran\ninfluence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n  \n \n  No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple\nsomersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she\nthe high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this\nbefore, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed\nby impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could\ncarry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n  \n \n  Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses\nwere not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra\nwas now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe.\nHowever, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he\nwas forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the\nsmooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n  \n \n  \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high\npriest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here\nqualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in\nthese arrangements, I hardly think you\u2014a mere private citizen\u2014have\nthe right to question them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said,\nwhirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages\nwhich were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of\nthis planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to\nutilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of\nall and now\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break\nup things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some\ntime.\"\n  \n \n  Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke\nhim into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of\nthe chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and\nBbulas had been thoroughly terranized.\n  \n \n \n   I hate Terrestrials\n   \n  , Skkiru said to himself.\n   \n   I hate Terra.\n   \n  The\nquiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling\nin his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae\u2014if he were\nto break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final\nhumiliation.\n  \n \n  \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her\nfiance\u2014her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused\nall such ties to be severed\u2014and every other literate person on the\nplanet, had received her education at the local university. Although\nsound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor\nin the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had\nsome sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are\nbehaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n  \n \n  \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a\npatience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no\nidea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It\nis, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Bbulas, a Snaddrath, was chosen as a young boy to attend a Terran school on Gambrell. This Terran League University was far too expensive for any Snaddrath to afford, not only due to tuition costs. The travel expenses alone were outrageous. And so, only one student per generation would receive funds to attend. Since Bbulas was schooled there, he has more Terran tendencies than his brethren, such as his ability to not show emotions or keep from whirling when upset. \nAfter attending university, he was selected to work as the Planetary Dilettante. This selection process involves testing Snaddrath in a variety of subjects. Evidently, Bbulas\u2019 scores were the highest, so when President Luccar declared a state of emergency, he chose Bbulas to fix the situation at hand. \nBbulas designed the Bbulas Plan to solve Snaddra\u2019s economic downfall. His ultimate goal was to entice Terrans to come to Snaddra and support the planet with foreign trade. In order to do so, he decided to completely redesign their entire culture and move their capital aboveground. Bbulas believes that Terrans will be more likely to help if Snaddra is primitive in nature. \nThe story begins with an argument between Skkiru, Larhgan, and Bbulas. Bbulas elected himself High Priest in the new world, and the lots elected Larhgan to be the High Priestess. Skkiru, her fiance, was to be a beggar, sot hey could no longer be together, much to Bbulas\u2019 delight. \nAfter passively threatening Skkiru, the three rise to the surface and ready themselves for the Terrans\u2019 arrival. \nBbulas welcomes the Terrans at the temple and invites them to a stop-the-rain ceremony. He sends the Terrans to their hut and then becomes upset at Skkiru for wearing mud shoes when he is supposed to be a beggar. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Bbulas is the Planetary Diletantte who has just overhauled the Snaddran society in preparation for the Terrans\u2019 study. He has done away with the president and parliament, replacing them with himself as high priest and a female high priestess. He has created elaborate rules and a new social hierarchy with all the roles assigned by lots, although some Snadds doubt the fairness of the lot-drawing. He has also made the Snadds move from underground to above ground even though the surface of the planet is covered with thick mud from the constant rain. Bbulas considers himself superior due to his education and thinks he is talented in multiple ways, including speechwriting and even building shelters. He anticipated the Terrans\u2019 interests and makes sure the females are scantily clad and rewrites the words to their popular songs to make them less suggestive in case the Terrans have learned any Snadd. The majority of the Snaddrath voted to adopt Bbulas\u2019s plan because no one else had come up with a better one. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Bbulas is a pompous and conceited man, and he fancies himself very important. He was chosen by the government as the only person from Snaddra to get a Terran education on the planet of Gambrell. Not a single citizen can afford the expenses associated with interplanetary travel, so Bbulas\u2019s opportunity is looked at as once-in-a-lifetime. \n\nBbulas takes advantage of his position as an elite. Although he claims that in the program he created, each individual\u2019s position was selected randomly, he openly acknowledges that he was the only person who could possibly pose as the high priest. When Skkiru complains about having to pose as a beggar when he was once a successful architect, Bbulas immediately threatens to turn him into a metal-worker, a member of the lowest caste system, instead. He is completely unconcerned about the breakup of Skkiru and Lahgran\u2019s relationship and simply reminds Skkiru that he must make sacrifices for the good of the planet. Skkiru knows that Bbulas has had his eyes on his fiance for quite some time, so it\u2019s no surprise that Bbulas have given her a role where he will get to spend loads of time with her. \n\nSkkiru definitely doesn\u2019t approve of Bbulas as the Planetary Dilettante and believes he passed the examination because the exam itself was deeply flawed. He believes someone with more charm and adaptiveness should be in charge of society\u2019s survival, and he isn\u2019t impressed with Bbula\u2019s grand scheme to win over the Terran anthropologists. When he hears Lahrgran making her speech as High Priestess, he instantly recognizes that Bbulas was the speechwriter and complains that it\u2019s far too long and involved. Bbulas is undeniably interested in hearing himself speak and truly believes that it is he alone who can save the Snaddrath from a terrible fate. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Bbulas is a member of the Snaddrath race, the group of people who live on Snaddra. He has a particular role in the society as the Planetary Dilettante, which means he is the one person in his generation who was afforded an off-world education where he could learn from the Terran style system, which focuses more on emotional regulation than the native training. He was educated on Gambrell, a nearby planet which has a Terran League University. The government can only afford to send one person per generation to receive this kind of schooling so it is considered a high honor. The Dilettante is the one on standby for when there are emergencies, and the President decided that the arrival of the Earthmen was such an emergency. In order to prepare for the arrival of the Terrans, he set up everything necessary to fool the Terrans into thinking the Snaddrath were more primitive than they actually were. He was the one who restructured society so that the metal workers were the lower class, as they were the most populous group of people, and assigned Skkiru the role of a beggar which forced him to break off his engagement with Larhgan as she was assigned the high priestess role. This is especially angering to Skkiru because Bbulas assigned himself the high priest role. Skkiru is frustrated with Bbulas for making him a beggar and also disappointed because he thinks he could have been more creative in his set-up of a new society, especially being as intelligent as he was. He used blueprints from a Terrestrial magazine to build some of the above-ground features, instead of designing his own, for instance. At the beginning of the story, he is bickering with Skkiru about the fact that Skkiru is now a beggar, and all of the issues that come for Skkiru with that. He eventually led Skkiru and Larhgan to the surface of the planet when they received notice that the Earthmen had arrived, and focused on greeting these visitors. After a procession is completed, at the end of this excerpt of the story, he is yelling at Skkiru in an attempt to show his power over him, insisting that Skkiru not think for himself and just abide by the guidelines Bbulas puts forth. \n"

        "Article": "Reba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,\nanyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by\nmaking us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go\n   \n   immediately\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Fred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!\nAnd if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making\nhim do it!\"\n  \n \n  Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,\nshocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n  \n \n  Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to\nFred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n  \n \n  Fred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he\nmuttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n  \n \n  \"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n  \n \n  Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room\ncame the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like\nsome reedy folk music.\n  \n \n  \"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.\n\"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a\nFweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity\nin circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n  \n \n  \"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the\npolarizer worked for a little while when we landed\u2014long enough to keep\nus from being squashed\u2014and then quit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or\nwhere it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like\nlinear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's\nwhen we dropped.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and\nrose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable\nspaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that\nthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n  \n \n  Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I\nwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.\n   \n   If\n   \n  we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.\nAll over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the\npolarizer will polarize it.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it\nisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n  \n \n  Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a\nfew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know\nthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water\nrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,\nanyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle\nof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?\nBefore we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more\nabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't\nbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept\nwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,\nwhat's the theory behind polarization?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the\njeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know\nhow light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can\ndo is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we\nlook at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.\nEarth gravity. The flivver\u2014even if the polarizer won't work, there's\nthe resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By\nthen, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here\nwe won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we\nwant.\"\n  \n \n  \"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.\n\"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not\nme.\"\n  \n \n  Junior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it\nhappened.\"\n  \n \n  \"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n  \n \n  \"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n  \n \n  \"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,\ncarrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a\nsmall box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,\nraspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n  \n \n  \"Not now,\" said Four.\n  \n \n  \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate\nits center of gravity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n  \n \n  \"It shifts.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n  \n \n  \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n  \n \n  \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following\nme.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n  \n \n  \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear\npolarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet\nso heavy. He's why we can't leave.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light\nthe vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When\nlight is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or\nrefraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are\nstill perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles\nor ellipses.\"\n  \n \n  The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n  \n \n  \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of\nmatter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle\naround itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of\nspaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity\ninto a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue\naccelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n  \n \n  The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no\nlonger. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.\nHe's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.\nHe doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe\nI didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the\nscientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the\nblamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near\nas I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else\nworry over 'why.'\"\n  \n \n  \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.\n\"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool\nperpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any\nmoron would know they were impossible.\"\n  \n \n  Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity\npolarizer before I invented it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n  \n \n  \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with\nsome coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,\ndragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out\nnear the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded\nironically.\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in\nfront of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard\nswearing in a steady monotone.\n  \n \n  \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n  \n \n  Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing\nwon't work.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't\nexpect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,\nit would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.\nFour is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.\nIt's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this\nplanet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n  \n \n  Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,\nI apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you\ngot the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n  \n \n  Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his\nhand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer\ncan work on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with\nthis problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's\na simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about\nthe cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because\nFweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work\nbecause he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,\nand he don't want Four to leave him.\n  \n \n  \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't\nunderstand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's\ngot Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor\nto Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we\nain't gonna do.\n  \n \n  \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use\nmaking a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer\nwith the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've\nalready solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,\nyou've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal\npoints.\"\n  \n \n  \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why\nthis computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's\nFour? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice\nsoft. \"No, here they come now.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered\nthe nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,\nFour,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes\nover a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing\ncannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making\nthe grand tour of the cabin.\n  \n \n  The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,\nabsorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n  \n \n  \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n  \n \n  Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no\nenzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use\nwhat he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n  \n \n  Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the\npickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum\nrose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n  \n \n  Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not\nmuch, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n  \n \n  \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few\ndeposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said\nunbelievingly.\n  \n \n  Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for\nskin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several\nfeet of lead.\"\n  \n \n  Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough\nenriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n  \n \n  \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it\nmight be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the\nthought.\n  \n<doc-sep>As if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously\ntoward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the\npolarizer turned on.\"\n  \n \n  The airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,\nfollowed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,\nscintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n  \n \n  \"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n  \n \n  \"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n  \n \n  \"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at\nonce. Joyce!\"\n  \n \n  The door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was\nregal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:\n\"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a\nfew low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n  \n \n  Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is\nas good as anybody's.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.\nShe turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy\nrich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like\nbillionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this\ncramped old flivver\u2014and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She\nglared venomously at Grampa.\n  \n \n  \"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n  \n \n  \"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n  \n \n  \"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As\nreal estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n  \n \n  \"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the\nend of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our\nlives right here\u2014involuntary colonists.\"\n  \n \n  Joyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n  \n \n  \"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either\nit's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that\njust won't polarize.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were\nany good.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.\n\"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n  \n \n  \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n  \n \n  \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the\ncabin for dust and lint?\"\n  \n \n  \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's\nlonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,\nexcitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n  \n \n  Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to\nit, I mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well? What did it say?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n  \n \n  At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into\nFour's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.\n\"Fwiend,\" it said.\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no\nproblem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n  \n \n  In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite\na sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually\nmean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to\nsuggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": " Grampa Peppergrass is an inventor, creator of the gravity polarizer and the space flivver, which have earned him one hundred million dollars. But he invested much of his earnings in perpetual motion machines and longevity pills. Now, the Peppergrass family travels to different planets, searching for radioactive metals that they can exploit to make themselves a fortune. The family consists of four generations of men and their spouses. Apparently, Grandpa, who is 90-years-old, is a widower. His son, Fred, is 60 and married to Joyce. Their son Junior, 35, is married to Reba; they are parents of an eight-year-old genius son known as Four.\n\tThe flivver they travel in was purchased by Grampa, who gave \u2159 ownership to each of the family members. The flivver\u2019s landing is unusually bumpy because the gravity polarizer failed. Through the view screen, they see that the planet has meadows, woodlands, plains, and lakes, and Four announces that it also has fauna before he rushes out the air lock to check it out. The ship has already ascertained that the air is almost like that on Earth, and there are no micro-organisms. When Four returns to the flivver accompanied by the native fauna, Fweep, he announces they are friends. The creature looks like a transparent blob and likes to sweep. Four is curious about what Fweep does with the sweepings since the outer inch or so of his body turns cloudy but clears afterward. \n\tAfter Fred and Junior use their scintillation counters to search for heavy metals, they return to the flivver to report there aren\u2019t any, just low-grade iron. The group mulls over what could be making the planet so heavy if it doesn\u2019t have heavy metals, but no one has the answer. \nJunior and Fred tell the rest of the family that the gravity polarizer isn\u2019t working and that without it, they will not be able to lift off. Reba looks on the bright side and says they can have more children instead of stopping at one child, as is currently the dictated number on Earth. In the meantime, Four returns from an excursion searching for the center of gravity for the planet and announces that it changes because of Fweep\u2019s presence. The little guy is a circular polarizer, making the planet heavy and preventing their gravity polarizer from working. Fweep is also radioactive and has impervious skin. Joyce is furious that Fweep is making them stay there, and when Grampa jokingly, or as a test, suggests leaving Four behind with Fweep, she immediately goes along with it. Four offers to stay behind with Fweep, who is lonely and likes having a friend so much it doesn\u2019t want to lose Four. Grampa announces that the problem isn\u2019t one that their computer can solve; instead, it\u2019s a logic problem like the ones Four told him earlier.   \n",
        "Summary_2": "A small, weird spaceship crashes into a meadow with four generations of the Peppergrass family inside. The men are Grampa, (Young) Fred, Junior, and Four. There are two women: Four's mom Reba, and Junior's mom Joyce. There is bickering, as Joyce doesn't think Grampa has spent his money well, and they argue about the role of gravity in their crash, which happened on a search for heavy metals to bring back to Earth. \nThe air should be safe to breathe, and they spot both plants and animals, so Four wants to rush outside. Junior pulls Fred into a private conversation explaining that something went wrong and their ship now won\u2019t move. When Four gets back, he brings with him a creature named Fweep: a gelatin-like orb about two feet in diameter that is raspberry in color. When he moves across the tile, he cleans it, picking up what he passes over. Joyce is appalled but Reba insists Four should be able to have a friend, so Four focuses on learning how Fweep's ability works. The ship shook when Grampa patted Fweep, and the family discussed a plan. The polarizer on the ship is broken so they might not be able to go anywhere. Grampa insists it can\u2019t be broken, Junior responds that polarization doesn\u2019t work here, so Fred insists on an explanation from Grampa about how gravity polarization works. Joyce insists Grampa doesn't actually know, and expresses her frustration that they aren't just getting rich from finding uranium. They figure they could build a community on the planet, but having more than one child per family is against their laws. As they argue about options, Four uses another contraption to try to find the planet\u2019s center of gravity. The center of gravity shifts when Fweep leaves - he is a circular polarizer, making the planet heavy, conflicting with the linear polarizer of the spaceship, which is why it can't move. Joyce tries to poison Fweep with rat poison but it can\u2019t hurt him, he doesn\u2019t consume what he picks up but rather uses matter to create radioactive substance: this means he has a lot of mass, and it was him their equipment picked up on, not uranium. They talk about how to turn off his gravity, but they don\u2019t know how, and figure he might be immortal. Fred tries to calm Joyce down but she suggest that they appeal to Fweep to let them go. Four says he\u2019d asked already, but Fweep doesn\u2019t want his only friend to leave. The question arises: what if Four stays behind? Junior is found yelling at a computer and doesn\u2019t want Four to stay behind, he refuses to leave his son on a strange planet. Grampa insists that Junior\u2019s computer work won\u2019t help them because it is not a scientific issue, but rather a moral and logical one. The story ends with Fweep and Four coming back from playing in the meadow with the family ready to discuss options.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Four generations of the Peppergrass family approach a new planet. They are riding a flivver, a spaceship that was poorly constructed for very little money. The flivver descends on the new planet, stops abruptly before impact, and lands and rocks back and forth in a grassy meadow. \n\nGrampa, the patriarch of the family, gets upset because his logic puzzle, a pircuit, is disrupted by the harsh landing. When his family members tell him to work on his game, he reminds them that he\u2019s the one that invented the gravity polarizer and the flivver. He also boasts that he made one hundred million dollars doing it. Joyce points out that he spent most of the money, and now the family is stuck searching various planets for uranium. \n\nFour, an eight-year-old boy, leaves the ship and returns with a creature that looks like a two-foot sphere made of raspberry flavored Jello. Almost simultaneously, Junior, the pilot, discovers that the polarizer stopped working, and now the flivver won\u2019t move at all. Joyce, Four\u2019s grandmother, tells him to get the blob away immediately, but Four has already named it Fweep because that\u2019s the only word it has said thus far, and he likes it. Fweep begins sweeping the floor, and his body picks up all of the particles that he passes through. When Grampa reaches down to pet the alien, the flivver physically shakes. \n\nFred reveals that the tests show that Fweep\u2019s planet has no uranium or other heavy metals that would be valuable to the Peppergrass family. They have a difficult time understanding why the planet is so heavy without those resources, and they are all disappointed that the new land will not bring them wealth. They have spent a year on the flivver and they have very little to show for themselves. Worst of all, they are now stuck on Fweep\u2019s planet. After a short discussion, it becomes clear that although Grampa created the polarizer, he has very little knowledge about how it works and how to fix it.\n\nFour discovers that Fweep\u2019s planet has a shifting center of gravity because Fweep himself is a circular polarizer. He is the force that makes the planet heavy. Joyce tries to feed Fweep poison so that the family can leave, but Fweep has zero enzymes and no nervous system. He\u2019s a radioactive being, but it\u2019s unclear what makes him that way. There is no way to kill Fweep because his skin is thicker than lead, and he doesn\u2019t breathe. Four believes he is the only one of his kind and that he is immortal. He reveals that he has been communicating with Fweep, and Fweep has told him that he will not let his family leave because he wants to be Four\u2019s friend. The family considers leaving Four on the planet alone, but his mother won\u2019t have it. Four leaves to play in the meadow with Fweep, and the other family members are left to come up with a solution to the problem. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Peppergrass family is made up of Grampa, their son Fred and his wife Joyce, their son Junior and his wife Reba, and their son Four. The Peppergrass men all looked alike and were currently onboard their Grampa\u2019s flivver which they each hold a share in. Due to Grampa\u2019s poor spending choices, they are currently broke and searching the universe for rare finds or radioactive materials to sell back on Earth. Their rocket, the flivver, lands on this new planet suddenly, as the polarizer gave out when it neared the surface. The men quickly go to investigate it, while Four decides to explore the new planet after looking out the window and discovering both flora and fauna. After reassuring his mother, Four rushes outside, while Junior and Fred discuss the polarizer issue. \nFour returns soon after with a gelatinous, dark pink blob with a mouth that calls itself Fweep. His family reacts somewhat negatively, but Four claims that Fweep is his friend. Reba allows Fweep to say and dismisses Joyce in the process. Fweep sweeps and absorbs matter and particulates into his body. He starts cleaning the floors of the spaceship leaving nothing behind. \nGrampa and Reba share a quick conversation about her choice to marry Junior. Four attempts to understand Fweep before talking with Grampa about his puzzle circuits. Fweep momentarily absorbed Grampa\u2019s hand before spitting it back out. The flivver shook as it did so. Despite having a similar atmosphere to Earth, this planet was extremely heavy, making it impossible to take off of. They toss around ideas, then come to the conclusion that there\u2019s something different about the gravity here. Four discovers that Fweep is the center of gravity after traipsing all across the planet trying to find it. Fweep is a circular polarizer, not a linear polarizer, so he makes the planet heavy and impossible for the polarizer to work. \nJoyce attempts to poison Fweep sometime later, but it doesn\u2019t work. Four reveals all that he\u2019s learned about Fweep and the way it works. After a quick outburst from Joyce, Four says that he\u2019s able to speak to Fweep. Fweep doesn\u2019t want to let them leave because Four is his friend. Joyce suggests leaving Four behind so the rest can leave, which Reba takes great offense to, though Four agrees with Joyce. Grampa and Junior attempt to solve their issue logically while Four and Fweep play outside. \n"

        "Query": "What are the different settings in The Gravity Business and what are their characteristics?",
        "Article": " \n  The Gravity Business\n  \n \n  By JAMES E. GUNN\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ASHMAN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could\nhe\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?\n   \n \n \n \n  The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the\nold, orange sun.\n  \n \n  It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The\nflivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat\ncylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been\nslapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,\nfully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n  \n \n  As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,\nat the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n  \n \n  A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass\nand knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that\nmade the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver\nrocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n  \n \n  Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n  \n \n  Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the\nair. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing\npractically whipped, too!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and\nrose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable\nspaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that\nthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n  \n \n  Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I\nwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.\n   \n   If\n   \n  we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.\nAll over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the\npolarizer will polarize it.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it\nisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n  \n \n  Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a\nfew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know\nthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water\nrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,\nanyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle\nof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?\nBefore we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more\nabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't\nbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept\nwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,\nwhat's the theory behind polarization?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the\njeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know\nhow light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He followed the signals of a spacesuited member of the port staff and\nmaneuvered out of the dome. Then he headed the tractor across the\nfrozen surface of Ganymede toward the permanent domes of the city.\n  \n \n  \"How is it here?\" asked the girl. \"They told me it's pretty rough.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you expect?\" asked Tolliver. \"Square dances with champagne?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly. Daddy says I'm supposed to learn traffic routing and\nthe business management of a local branch. They probably won't let me\nsee much else.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never can tell,\" said the pilot, yielding to temptation. \"Any\nsquare inch of Ganymede is likely to be dangerous.\"\n  \n \n \n   I'll be sorry later\n   \n  , he reflected,\n   \n   but if Jeffers keeps me jockeying\nthis creeper, I'm entitled to some amusement. And Daddy's little girl\nis trying too hard to sound like one of the gang.\n   \n \n \n  \"Yeah,\" he went on, \"right now, I don't do a thing but drive missions\nfrom the city to the spaceport.\"\n  \n \n  \"Missions! You call driving a mile or so a\n   \n   mission\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver pursed his lips and put on a shrewd expression.\n  \n \n  \"Don't sneer at Ganymede, honey!\" he warned portentously. \"Many a\nman who did isn't here today. Take the fellow who used to drive this\nmission!\"\n  \n \n  \"You can call me Betty. What happened to him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll tell you some day,\" Tolliver promised darkly. \"This moon can\nstrike like a vicious animal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they told me there was nothing alive on Ganymede!\"\n  \n \n  \"I was thinking of the mountain slides,\" said the pilot. \"Not to\nmention volcanic puffballs that pop out through the frozen crust where\nyou'd least expect. That's why I draw such high pay for driving an\nunarmored tractor.\"\n  \n \n  \"You use armored vehicles?\" gasped the girl.\n  \n \n  She was now sitting bolt upright in the swaying seat. Tolliver\ndeliberately dipped one track into an icy hollow. In the light gravity,\nthe tractor responded with a weird, floating lurch.\n  \n \n  \"Those slides,\" he continued. \"Ganymede's only about the size of\nMercury, something like 3200 miles in diameter, so things get heaped up\nat steep angles. When the rock and ice are set to sliding, they come\nat you practically horizontally. It doesn't need much start, and it\nbarrels on for a long way before there's enough friction to stop it. If\nyou're in the way\u2014well, it's just too bad!\"\n  \n \n \n   Say, that's pretty good!\n   \n  he told himself.\n   \n   What a liar you are,\nTolliver!\n   \n \n \n  He enlarged upon other dangers to be encountered on the satellite,\ntaking care to impress the newcomer with the daredeviltry of John\nTolliver, driver of \"missions\" across the menacing wastes between dome\nand port.\n  \n \n  In the end, he displayed conclusive evidence in the form of the weekly\npaycheck he had received that morning. It did not, naturally, indicate\nhe was drawing the salary of a space pilot. Betty looked thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"I'm retiring in six months if I'm still alive,\" he said bravely,\nedging the tractor into the airlock at their destination. \"Made my\npile. No use pushing your luck too far.\"\n  \n \n  His charge seemed noticeably subdued, but cleared her throat to request\nthat Tolliver guide her to the office of the manager. She trailed along\nas if with a burden of worry upon her mind, and the pilot's conscience\nprickled.\n  \n \n \n   I'll get hold of her after Jeffers is through and set her straight\n   \n  ,\nhe resolved.\n   \n   It isn't really funny if the sucker is too ignorant to\nknow better.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light\nthe vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When\nlight is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or\nrefraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are\nstill perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles\nor ellipses.\"\n  \n \n  The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n  \n \n  \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of\nmatter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle\naround itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of\nspaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity\ninto a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue\naccelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n  \n \n  The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no\nlonger. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.\nHe's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.\nHe doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe\nI didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the\nscientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the\nblamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near\nas I remember. Now me\u2014I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else\nworry over 'why.'\"\n  \n \n  \"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.\n\"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool\nperpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any\nmoron would know they were impossible.\"\n  \n \n  Grampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity\npolarizer before I invented it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n  \n \n  \"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with\nsome coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,\ndragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out\nnear the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded\nironically.\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't\n   \n   Guns\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pistols\n   \n  ; and it wasn't\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pluto\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n  \n \n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n  \n \n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  Theater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n  \n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\n   \n   zilcon\n   \n  wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men\u2014all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n  \n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\n  \n \n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n  \n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n  \n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n  \n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n  \n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Nonsense,\" Manet said. \"No group of private individuals can build a\nspaceship. It takes a combine of nations.\"\n  \n \n  \"But remember only that businessmen are reactionary. It's well-known.\nAsk anyone on the street. Businessmen are reactionary even beyond the\ncapitalistic system. Money is a fiction that exists mostly on paper.\nThey play along on paper to get paper things, but to get real things\nthey can forego the papers. Comprehend,\n   \n   mon ami\n   \n  ? My businessmen\nhave gone back to the barter system. Between them, they have the raw\nmaterials, the trained men, the man-hours to make a spaceship. So they\nmake it. Damned reactionaries, all of my principals.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't believe you,\" Manet stated flatly. His conversation had grown\nblunt with disuse. \"What possible profit could your principals turn\nfrom running a trading ship among scattered exploration posts on the\nplanets? What could you give us that a benevolent government doesn't\nalready supply us with? And if there was anything, how could we pay for\nit? My year's salary wouldn't cover the transportation costs of this\nglass of whiskey.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you find it good whiskey?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very good.\"\n  \n \n  \"Excellent?\"\n  \n \n  \"Excellent, if you prefer.\"\n  \n \n  \"I only meant\u2014but never mind. We give you what you want. As for\npaying for it\u2014why, forget about the payment. You may apply for a\nTrader Tom Credit Card.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I could buy anything that I wanted with it?\" Manet demanded.\n\"That's absurd. I'd never be able to pay for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's it precisely!\" Trader Tom said with enthusiasm. \"You\n   \n   never\n   \n  pay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your\n   \n   estate\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"But I may leave no estate!\"\n  \n \n  Trader Tom demonstrated his peculiar shrug. \"All businesses operate on\na certain margin of risk. That is our worry.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The first setting mentioned in the story is the flivver, a bullet-shaped spaceship that lands vertically on the blunt end. It is made of sheet metal and insulation board. Fully equipped, a flivver sells for $15,730. The flivver has a large central cabin with the pilot\u2019s chair; the control stick is situated between the pilot\u2019s knees, and there is an on/off button for the gravity polarizer. It is also equipped with a computer named Abacus that analyzes data that fed into it. Flivvers have their own power plants that operate their lights, air and water recirculation systems, and food and clothing synthesizers. It also has a storage battery. Off of the central cabin, there are several private rooms. The flivver is owned jointly by the Peppergrass family; Grandpa bought it the \u201823 model and gave everyone \u2159 shares. The flivver also carries devices that can analyze the air and detect microorganisms.\nThe other setting where the story takes place is on a planet much like Earth, with a diameter smaller than Mercury\u2019s but a gravitational pull as strong as Earth\u2019s. The Peppergrass family calls the world Fweepland since \u201cFweep\u201d is the sound/word the one organism there says. Fweepland\u2019s air is within 1% of Earth\u2019s air, and there are no microorganisms present. Fweepland features a beautiful landscape with a peaceful green woodland, grassy plains, a meadow, and a blue lake. The only organism they encounter is Fweep, a friendly blob-shaped creature that sweeps over debris and picks it up. The Peppergrass family hopes to find radioactive or heavy metals on the planet, but their scintillation counters only detect low-grade iron. Four points out that while it doesn\u2019t have the metals they are looking for, the planet is very valuable as real estate. Interestingly, the planet\u2019s center of gravity shifts wherever Fweep goes. A day on Fweepland is 16 Earth hours, as that is the length of time it takes for one rotation of the planet.\nThe story presumably takes place sometime in the 22nd century as Grampa references Einstein\u2019s work \u201ctwo hundred years ago.\u201d There are some references to life on Earth at this time. Families are only allowed one child; if they have more, they are exiled from civilization. We can also assume that others are traveling into space since Grampa became wealthy from his invention of flivvers and gravity polarizers. People on Earth are trying to lengthen their lives, hence Grampa\u2019s efforts to create longevity pills and his hundred-year contract with the Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\n",
        "Summary_2": "There are two settings directly important to the story: one is the planet which the Peppergrass family calls Fweepland, and the other is the spaceship that took them there. Inside the small spaceship are a number of computers that the family interacts with (ones that run puzzles are called pircuit, and the computer that runs the ship is called Abacus). There are personal rooms for the members of the family, and an area to pilot the ship from. Outside of the airlock is the planet the Peppergrass family finds themselves on after the crash: Four refers to it as Fweepland, after the creature he meets who he calls Fweep because \"fweep\" is the only word the creature seems capable of saying. It has beautiful grassy meadows, one of which was the location of the crash. There are various plants and animals on the planet, but one unique creature named Fweep seems to stand on his own. ",
        "Summary_3": "\u201cThe Gravity Business\u201d takes place on the flivver, a spaceship which Grampa designed, and Fweep\u2019s planet. The flivver has been the Peppergrass\u2019s home for about a year at this point. Although Grampa had millions of dollars not that long ago, he spent it all on frivolous inventions, and the family is now forced to search uncolonized planets for uranium or other expensive heavy metals. It is clear that the family members are getting on each others\u2019 nerves after spending so much time together cooped up in a crude contraption that was built for only $15,000. \n\nFweep\u2019s planet is very similar to Earth, the original home of the Peppergrass family. It is smaller than Mercury, but it has almost the same level of gravity as Earth. The surface is covered with grass and white flowers. Because the planet is unusually heavy for its size, the family believes they may find heavy metals there. However, their instincts are wrong, and the reason the planet is heavy is because Fweep, an alien creature, is polarizing the gravity. At one point, Reba points out that the land is beautiful and fertile, and it really isn\u2019t the worst place to get stuck. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Gravity Business by James E. Gunn takes place on a deserted planet called by the crew the Land of the Fweep or Fweepland. The planet is beautiful, featuring woodlands, prairies, and a blue lake. This green meadow is untouched by any humanity, meaning no buildings, structures, or paved roads. Four is shocked to discover that this planet has both flora and fauna. Each day lasts only 16 Earth hours, significantly shorter than Earth days. \nThe flivver on which they travel is cramped and bullet-shaped. Its relatively ugly figure is unlike any other rocket ship, but it gets the job done. Built with the polarizer discovered by Grampa, this ship is their last hope in making any money to retire and settle down. \nAs well, the society in which they lived before only allowed one child per couple, suggesting overpopulation. \n"

But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the\nflivver won't move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it\nstopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,\nwe'll just have to do away with it.\"\n  \n \n  \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and\nyou can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so\nyou can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'\neverything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.\nRight now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower\nhis radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.\nEither way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around\nand wait for that thing to die?\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his\nkind on this planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n  \n \n  \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n  \n \n  \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.\nReproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal\ncreatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or\nsomething. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger\nthan when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"\nFred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its\nwater, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered\nthe nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,\nFour,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes\nover a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing\ncannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making\nthe grand tour of the cabin.\n  \n \n  The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,\nabsorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n  \n \n  \"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n  \n \n  Joyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no\nenzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use\nwhat he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n  \n \n  Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the\npickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum\nrose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n  \n \n  Junior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not\nmuch, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n  \n \n  \"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few\ndeposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said\nunbelievingly.\n  \n \n  Four nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his\u2014whatever it is he uses for\nskin\u2014is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several\nfeet of lead.\"\n  \n \n  Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough\nenriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n  \n \n  \"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it\nmight be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the\nthought.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n  \n \n  \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand\nimpatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n  \n \n  Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with\naliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't\nlike to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n  \n \n  Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes\nme sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly\nat Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept\ngrandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that\nopened out from it.\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n  \n \n  Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a\nnarrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n  \n \n  Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely\nclosed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"\nhe said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never\nhad the nerve.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n  \n \n  \"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior\nwould have had competition!\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned\nover confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever\nmarried a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw\nsomething in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been\nsubmerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you\nand to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I\nthought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and\nrose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable\nspaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that\nthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n  \n \n  Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I\nwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.\n   \n   If\n   \n  we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.\nAll over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the\npolarizer will polarize it.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it\nisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n  \n \n  Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a\nfew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know\nthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water\nrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,\nanyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle\nof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?\nBefore we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more\nabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't\nbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept\nwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,\nwhat's the theory behind polarization?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the\njeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know\nhow light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.\n\"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n  \n \n  \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n  \n \n  \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the\ncabin for dust and lint?\"\n  \n \n  \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's\nlonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,\nexcitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n  \n \n  Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to\nit, I mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well? What did it say?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n  \n \n  At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into\nFour's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.\n\"Fwiend,\" it said.\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no\nproblem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n  \n \n  In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite\na sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually\nmean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to\nsuggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently.\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in\nfront of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard\nswearing in a steady monotone.\n  \n \n  \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n  \n \n  Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing\nwon't work.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't\nexpect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,\nit would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.\nFour is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.\nIt's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this\nplanet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n  \n \n  Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,\nI apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you\ngot the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n  \n \n  Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his\nhand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer\ncan work on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with\nthis problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's\na simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about\nthe cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because\nFweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work\nbecause he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,\nand he don't want Four to leave him.\n  \n \n  \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't\nunderstand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's\ngot Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor\nto Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we\nain't gonna do.\n  \n \n  \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use\nmaking a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer\nwith the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've\nalready solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,\nyou've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal\npoints.\"\n  \n \n  \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why\nthis computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's\nFour? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice\nsoft. \"No, here they come now.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Fweep is significant because he is the only creature living on Fweepland. He is a blob-shaped, raspberry-colored, gelatinous, transparent creature who sweeps up the debris that he runs over and engulfs it in his body. After he sweeps up particles, the outer inch or two of his body turns cloudy, then slowly clears. It seems he also absorbs substances from human contact since he follows a crooked path and hiccups after Grampa, who has been imbibing, pats him. He has a pseudo-mouth and makes the sound, or says the word, \u201cFweep.\u201d His skin is impervious, and he has no enzymes or nervous system, so rat poison has no effect on him. Fweep immediately befriends Four. \n\tWhen Four explores Fweepland to identify its center of gravity, he discovers that it shifts because Fweep is a circular polarizer. Fweep is what makes the planet so heavy and prevents the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer from working so the family can leave. Fweep is slightly radioactive and likely immortal and incapable of reproduction since there is no need to reproduce. Because he has circular polarization, linear polarization is uncomfortable to him, so Fweep turned of the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer just before they landed. Fweep wants to be helpful, but he doesn\u2019t want Four to leave since Four is the only friend he has ever had. Fweep was lonely before he met Four. Fweep will let the Peppergrass family leave only if Four stays with him. Fweep is responsible for the family\u2019s landing on Fweepland and their predicament of being unable to leave.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Fweep is a creature that Four finds when the Peppergrass family lands on an unknown planet. He is a gelatin-like orb about two feet in diameter that is raspberry in color, and has something resembling a mouth. However, he has an interesting ability in which he picks up particulates on the ground by rolling around. He calls this sweeping, and we find out later in the story that he is able to convert the materials in what he picks up to create radioactive matter. Because of this ability, he has a very high mass which the Peppergrass family misinterpreted as heavy metals as they were scanning the planet, which is what drew them to the planet in the first place. Fweep is also responsible for the ship's crashing: because of his mass, Fweep is a circular polarizer, which conflicted with the linear polarizer of the spaceship. Fweep and Four become instant friends when they meet, which adds another layer of complication to the relationship that the family has with Fweep. He could let the family return home, which they can't do under his gravitational pull, but Fweep does not want to let the family go if that means that Four would leave him, and Four is his only friend. This presents a moral conundrum to the family: they could return if they leave Four on the planet, but they do not want to leave a family member behind. ",
        "Summary_3": "Fweep is a pink colored blob, and he\u2019s about two-feet wide. He looks like gelatin, and he picks up dust and particles as he moves across the floor of the flivver. The outer couple of inches of his body become cloudy when he does this, and then they clear again. Fweep gets his name because when Four first meets him and brings him back to the flivver, the only word he says is \u201cFweep?\u201d He is trying to ask Four if he should sweep the spaceship. He wants to be helpful because he has no other friends or family members on his planet. \n\nThe family has a difficult time figuring out why their ship\u2019s polarizer won\u2019t work, and Fweep ends up being the culprit. Fweep is a circular polarizer, and he is the reason that the planet is so heavy. He is a being entirely different than anything living on Earth. Four believes he is immortal because he appears to be the only one of his kind. As far as they know, he cannot be killed because he has zero enzymes, no nervous system, his skin is impenetrable, and he doesn\u2019t breathe. Junior uses a special tool to test Fweep\u2019s radioactivity levels, and he finds that the creature is radioactive, although it\u2019s unclear how or why. \n\nWhen the family\u2019s flivver lands, Fweep does not like the feeling of linear polarization, so he neutralizes it. This causes the spaceship to abruptly fall to the ground. After he meets Four, the eight-year-old genius of the family, he decides that he wants to be his friend. Four asks Fweep if his family can leave the planet, and Fweep tells him he doesn\u2019t want his friend to leave. He enjoys sitting in Four\u2019s lap and even learns the word \u201cfwend.\u201d Fweep won\u2019t allow the flivver\u2019s polarizer to work, so the family cannot leave. He won\u2019t allow the polarizer to work because he wants to stay friends with Four. When the story abruptly comes to an end, the Peppergrass adults are trying to figure out how to solve this problem. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Fweep is a gelatinous life-form, unlike anything the Peppergrass family has ever seen before. Fweep is slightly radioactive after having absorbed much of the radioactive substances found on this planet. He can also convert ordinary matter into a radioactive substance. Fweep is unstable, unshootable, and unable to be poisoned. Fweep does not breathe, so he is unable to be suffocated or drowned. As well, Fweep may be immortal, since there are no other of his kind. Since he\u2019s the only one of his kind, he\u2019s very lonely and latches onto Four as soon as he arrives. Fweep controls the gravity of Fweepland, and uses circular gravity not linear gravity. His powers are extraordinary and completely unknown. "

The boy was staring\nintently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n  \n \n  \"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said\nabsently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then\nslowly clears.

The translucent sphere had\npaused at Grampa's feet.\n  \n \n  Grampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared\ninto Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path\nseemed crooked.\n  \n \n  Its gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it.

Behind Four, like a round,\nraspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n  \n \n  \"Not now,\" said Four.\n  \n \n  \"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate\nits center of gravity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n  \n \n  \"It shifts.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n  \n \n  \"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n  \n \n  \"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following\nme.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n  \n \n  \"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear\npolarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet\nso heavy. He's why we can't leave.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry\ngelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.\nIt opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?\nFweep?\"\n  \n \n  Joyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her\nface. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.\n\"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n  \n \n  \"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n  \n \n  \"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the\ncabin for dust and lint?\"\n  \n \n  \"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's\nlonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,\nexcitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n  \n \n  Behind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to\nit, I mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Four admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well? What did it say?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n  \n \n  At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into\nFour's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.\n\"Fwiend,\" it said.\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no\nproblem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n  \n \n  In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite\na sacrifice to ask, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually\nmean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to\nsuggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently.\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and\nrose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable\nspaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that\nthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n  \n \n  Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I\nwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.\n   \n   If\n   \n  we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.\nAll over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the\npolarizer will polarize it.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it\nisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n  \n \n  Grampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a\nfew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know\nthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water\nrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,\nanyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle\nof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?\nBefore we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more\nabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't\nbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept\nwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,\nwhat's the theory behind polarization?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the\njeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know\nhow light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in\nfront of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard\nswearing in a steady monotone.\n  \n \n  \"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n  \n \n  Junior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing\nwon't work.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't\nexpect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,\nit would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.\nFour is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.\nIt's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this\nplanet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n  \n \n  Grampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,\nI apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you\ngot the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n  \n \n  Junior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his\nhand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer\ncan work on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with\nthis problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's\na simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about\nthe cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because\nFweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work\nbecause he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,\nand he don't want Four to leave him.\n  \n \n  \"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't\nunderstand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's\ngot Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor\nto Four, he'd let us leave\u2014if we'd leave Four here with him, which we\nain't gonna do.\n  \n \n  \"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use\nmaking a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer\nwith the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've\nalready solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,\nyou've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal\npoints.\"\n  \n \n  \"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why\nthis computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's\nFour? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice\nsoft. \"No, here they come now.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Four is the highly intelligent, eight-year-old youngest member of the Peppergrass family. Although he is the youngest, he is the one who figures out the answers to why Fweepland is so heavy and how Fweep disables the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer. As a child, he is more impulsive than the adults, for example rushing outside to meet Fweep when the others stay back, but this enables him to solve problems and answer questions faster. On the other hand, his lack of experience prevents him from solving the ultimate problem of how to leave the planet, but his riddles and comment that creating a puzzle means you already know the solution trigger an idea for Grampa that may help solve the family\u2019s dilemma. By befriending Fweep so readily, Four discovers that Fweep is responsible for the planet\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d heaviness and the failure of the flivver\u2019s gravity polarizer. He also studies Fweep and determines his significant characteristics such as his impervious skin, lack of enzymes, and radioactivity. While the adults discuss and bemoan the fact that they cannot leave Fweepland, Four goes out and tries to identify the planet\u2019s center of gravity and therefore discovers that Fweep affects the planet\u2019s gravity and that he is a circular polarizer. At the end of the story, Junior even relies on Four to find out why the computer won\u2019t work. Not only is Four a problem solver and investigator, but he is also logical and selfless. He realizes that Fweep doesn\u2019t want him to leave and is willing to stay behind with Fweep so that the rest of his family can leave. ",
        "Summary_2": "Four is the youngest of the Peppergrass family, the son of Junior and Reba. He is eight years old, and due to his unusual upbringing living on a ship with his family, does not have many friends of his own. When the family crash-lands on a planet, he discovers a creature who he calls Fweep and the two instantly become friends. Four seems to understand the creatures when he talks, and can interpret his requests. Four is a curious child, and wants to solve the problem of why the ship can't go anywhere after it crash landed, so he took Fweep on an adventure to find the center of gravity of the planet. It is Four who discovers that Fweep is the center of gravity, and it is the fact that this point shifts that makes the gravity (and thus, the polarization) so unpredictable. It is also Four who aims to learn more about the planet outside of the ship, and not just about the problems on the ship itself, and it is this perspective that drives any progress they made. Besides learning about the moving center of gravity, he learns about the way Fweep picks things up as he rolls over them, and investigates how he converts matter and what his outer shell might be contributing to the distribution of energy. After discovering that Fweep is responsible for the gravity of the planet, things get more complicated. Four is at the center of a moral conundrum at the end of the story: if the family wants to return home, they have to appeal to Fweep, who controls the polarization on the planet. However, Fweep's terms are that Four would have to stay behind, because he does not want his only friend to leave. ",
        "Summary_3": "Four is an eight-year-old genius and a member of the Peppergrass family. He is pale, has a thin face, and acts much, much older than he is. His mother is Reba and his father is Junior. His parents are concerned about his lack of friends and socialization. He truly acts like an adult, and it seems as though he never got to have a normal childhood. When his Grampa struggles to figure out his logic puzzle, Four solves it for him in mere moments. He then comes up with another puzzle for his Grampa to solve, and he even offers to build him a pircuit board with a few parts that he has laying around the flivver. Four is very excited to meet his new friend Fweep, and it\u2019s clear that he does not want to immediately come clean about Fweep being the reason the family\u2019s spaceship can\u2019t take off. Since he has had so few friends in his life, the pink blob that follows him around means a lot to him, especially since he actually tells Four that he wants to be his friend. If it were up to Four, the family would probably stay on Fweep's planet and colonize the fertile land. However, several of the family members are completely against this idea, and Reba refuses to leave her son behind so that the spaceship can take off again. They are in this conundrum when the story ends. ",
        "Summary_4": "Four is the youngest of the Peppergrass men and perhaps one of the smartest. Despite his young age, he is very intelligent and understanding of the world of rocketships and interplanetary travel. His mother, Reba, worries after him, especially since he doesn\u2019t have any friends to play with or a school to attend. He creates games for his Grampa to solve and puzzle circuits as well. However, when they land on this new planet, he quickly makes a friend in Fweep. After discovering that the planet\u2019s gravity is attached to Fweep and therefore circular, he effectively discovered the true issue at hand. It was not the polarizer that was keeping them trapped, it was Fweep. Four nobly offers to stay behind with Fweep, so the rest can leave and Fweep won\u2019t be lonely. All Fweep wants is a friend, and Four is happy to be that friend. "

        "Article": "He cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light\nthe vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When\nlight is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or\nrefraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are\nstill perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles\nor ellipses.\"\n  \n \n  The faces were still blank and unillumined.\n  \n \n  \"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of\nmatter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle\naround itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of\nspaceships and later the polarizer.

That makes the ship take off and continue\naccelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n  \n \n  The faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no\nlonger. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.\nHe's just a tinkerer.

Thorium?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a\nfew low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n  \n \n  Junior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is\nas good as anybody's.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.\nShe turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy\nrich.

Either\nit's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that\njust won't polarize.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were\nany good.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do\nsomething with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here\nat the whim of a mere blob!\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what\nhe's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends\nthe space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't\nknow. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the\nflivver won't move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it\nstopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,\nwe'll just have to do away with it.\"\n  \n \n  \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and\nyou can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so\nyou can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'\neverything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.\nRight now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower\nhis radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.\nEither way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around\nand wait for that thing to die?\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his\nkind on this planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n  \n \n  \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n  \n \n  \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.\nReproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal\ncreatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or\nsomething. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger\nthan when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"\nFred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its\nwater, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n  \n \n  \"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand\nimpatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n  \n \n  Four's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with\naliens. And that's nothing but a\u2014a blob!\"\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't\nlike to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n  \n \n  Joyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes\nme sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly\nat Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me\u2014well!\" She swept\ngrandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that\nopened out from it.\n  \n \n  \"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep\u2014I mean sweep.\"\n  \n \n  Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a\nnarrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n  \n \n  Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely\nclosed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"\nhe said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that.

Then he leaned\nover confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever\nmarried a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw\nsomething in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been\nsubmerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you\nand to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I\nthought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Grampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last\nbutton on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to\ndo, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n  \n \n  \"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth\nshare.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money\nbought it?\"\n  \n \n  \"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n  \n \n  \"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space\nflivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n  \n \n  \"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n  \n \n  \"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the\nrest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n  \n \n  \"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and\nlongevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to\ngo searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly\ngalaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be\nsorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just\nbefore we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that\nLife-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?\nWell, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a\nbutton. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n  \n \n  Four stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the\ncomputer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from\nEarth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n  \n \n  Grampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense\nconcentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,\ntaking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player\nwho makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is\nto\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask\nfor it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted\nindignantly.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Joyce is Junior\u2019s mother and Fred\u2019s wife and is nearly sixty years old; she is still in good shape: slender, elegant, and attractive. However, she is described as having ice water instead of blood in her veins because she is such a cold-hearted woman much of the time. Joyce creates most of the tension in the story; she is frequently at odds with Grampa and says whatever she thinks, no matter how rude or hurtful it is. She presents as a spoiled, self-centered woman who only wants lots of money. Grampa\u2019s inventions made him a multimillionaire, but she accuses him of wasting the money on new inventions and making it so that they had to travel the galaxy searching for uranium and other habitable worlds. When Grampa tells her he has set some money aside and she\u2019ll be sorry when he\u2019s dead, she responds that he\u2019ll never die. And she knows he bought a hundred-year contract with the Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company. Joyce is eager to get her hands on some of Grampa\u2019s money and resents that he is using some of it to carry out his research. When Four brings Fweep aboard the flivver, she is thoroughly disgusted and insists he take it back out; when Reba stands up for Four and Fweep and calls Joyce Grammy, Joyce is furious and goes into her private room. Later, she even tries to poison Fweep by leaving rat poison on the floor. When the men return from checking Fweepland for heavy metals or radioactive elements, she eagerly comes out of her room and immediately asks if they had found any uranium, radium, or thorium. Their negative answer again draws her ire and shows her greed. She complains to Fred that they are all supposed to get filthy rich finding radioactives and retire on Earth as billionaires. She resents the year they have spent looking for radioactives. When she learns that Fweep is the reason they can\u2019t leave the planet, her first reaction is to kill him, and when she learns that killing him isn\u2019t possible, she readily and seriously agrees to Grampa\u2019s joke that they should leave Four behind so the rest of them can leave. Again, Joyce only wants what is best for her, and she is ready to kill or abandon anyone who stands in her way.",
        "Summary_2": "Joyce is the mother of Junior, an almost-60-year old woman who is very cold and bitter in most of her interactions with the rest of the family. She constantly berates Grampa for how he spends his money and what he may or may not understand about science, especially the polarizer. She is appalled when she encounters Fweep for the first time, but Reba stands up for Four and Fweep and reminds Joyce that she can always go to her room to stay away from it. Joyce just wanted to gain money by finding radioactive material on their journey, but getting rich seems to be her only goal so she is not entertained by the interesting distractions that the rest of the crew find endearing or curious. She makes fun of Grampa for happening upon the right configuration to build a successful polarizer and says his skill and scientific knowledge had nothing to do with his \"accidental\" success. Joyce is the only one who is potentially serious about leaving Four behind on the planet in return for the ability to leave, and people do not usually stand up to her--when Reba stands up for Four's right to have Fweep as a friend, the rest of the family is surprised, and even in awe. Joyce even tries to poison Fweep by leaving out rat poison before she learns that he cannot be affected by it. In general, she is angry or hysterical and is always antagonistic, and acts as the main source of conflict in the family. ",
        "Summary_3": "Joyce is Grampa\u2019s wife and Four\u2019s grandmother, but she refuses to be called by that name. Although she is almost sixty years old, she is still thin and beautiful. However, she is also very difficult to get along with. She openly blames her husband for spending all of their money and essentially ruining their lives, and she tells the rest of the family members his secret about purchasing some type of contract that will extend his life. When Grampa tries to explain how the polarizer works, Joyce immediately pipes up and tells everyone that he is just a tinkerer and has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Despite the fact that he invented the polarizer and the flivver they are using to travel, she gives him zero credit. Joyce hates living on the flivver and traveling to all sorts of different planets to search for heavy metals. She would much rather be on Earth. When she meets Fweep, she is disgusted and wants him as far away as possible. After she finds out that Fweep is the reason the ship is stuck on the unknown planet, she actually tries to feed the alien rat poison, but it doesn\u2019t work. Joyce would most likely leave Four, a young child, behind to fend for himself on a planet he\u2019s never before visited, but her daughter-in-law Reba will not allow the family to take off without Four. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Joyce is Fred\u2019s wife and prone to tantrums. She is often upset when things don\u2019t go her way and more blunt than may be considered socially acceptable. For example, she is the first to suggest that they leave Four behind so the rest can escape, much to Reba\u2019s horror. As well, she\u2019s upset when Fweep is first introduced to the family circle, especially since his presence forces her to retreat. Joyce often causes conflict, tension, and drama throughout the story with her survivalist attitude and unfortunately unpleasant attitude.  "

        "Query": "What is the story about THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR and how does it relate to Edmund's day of mishaps?",
        "Article": "  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon. And he was prepared as no man had ever prepared himself\n   \n  before....\n  \n \n \n  DESIRE NO MORE\n  \n \n  by Algis Budrys\n  \n \n  (\n   \n   illustrated by Milton Luros\n   \n  )\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Desire no more than to thy lot may fall....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \u2014Chaucer\n  \n \n \n<doc-sep>But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n  \n \n  When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how\nmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls\nwere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the\nother side of them.\n  \n \n  I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n  \n \n  I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.\nI dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the\nelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda\nwould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient\nreason for me to be late.\n  \n \n  He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n  \n \n  I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the\ndoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n  \n \n  I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs\nexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and\ndown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of\nstairs since I was twelve years old.\n  \n \n  Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,\ndidn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was\nthe use of stairs?\n  \n \n  Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary\ninformation), the Project had been built when there still had been such\nthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which\nwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government\nhad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which\nrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the\ncity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n  \n \n  And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after\nall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a\nflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n  \n \n  Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.\nIf the door would open.\n  \n \n  It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since\nlast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and\nfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,\ntook a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight\nsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n  \n \n  On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a\nsmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one\ntime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked\naway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered\nthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with\ndifficulty.\n  \n \n  I read them. They said:\n  \n \n  EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n   \n  ELEVATOR SHAFT\n   \n  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n   \n  ONLY\n   \n  KEEP LOCKED\n  \n \n  I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly\nguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible\nanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply\nhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed\nshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.\nSomebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n  \n \n  As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and\nthe spy came out, waving a gun.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first\nplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,\nin the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the\nelevator shaft.\n  \n \n  Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we\ncame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n  \n \n  He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun\nstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't\nmove!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n  \n \n  I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.\nWhich left me quite free to study him.\n  \n \n  He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony\nhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He\nwore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked\nexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he\n   \n   didn't\n   \n  look like a\nspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he\nreminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to\nmy parents' apartment.\n  \n \n  His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand\nat the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n  \n \n  I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from\nperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the\nopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending\nboots. The Army!\n  \n \n  But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He\nsaid, \"Where do you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.\nI knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions\npromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to\neither escape or capture him.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n  \n \n  And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at\nthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,\nand grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one\nfalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're\nfriends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n  \n \n  I nodded.\n  \n \n  \"All right. Let's go.\"\n  \n \n  We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as\nit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one\nemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I\nthumbed the door open and we went inside.\n  \n \n  Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against\nthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile\nplaying across his lips.\n  \n \n  I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could\nleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have\nread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He\nsaid, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill\nanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until\nthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able\nto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any\nsilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n  \n \n  \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got\nany chico coffee?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with\nboiling water.\"\n  \n \n  \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two\ncups, lunch and dinner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've\ndone everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a\nthorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally,\nis in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions\nare being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the\nevening\u2014which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\"\n  \n \n  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table.\nCeleste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that\nhad engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.\n  \n \n  \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly\nabout the Deep Shaft.\"\n  \n \n  \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five\nmiles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\"\n  \n \n  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes\nwent toward Ivan's briefcase.\n  \n<doc-sep>Theodor rubbed his eyes and pushed his chair back from the table. \"We\nneed a break.\"\n  \n \n  Frieda agreed wearily. \"We've gone through everything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good idea,\" Edmund said briskly. \"I think we've hit on several crucial\npoints along the way and half disentangled them from the great mass of\ninconsequential material. I'll finish up that part of the job right now\nand present my case when we're all a bit fresher. Say half an hour?\"\n  \n \n  Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching his\ncloak over a shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going out for a drink,\" he informed them.\n  \n \n  After several hesitant seconds, Rosalind quietly followed him. Frieda\nstretched out on a couch and closed her eyes. Edmund scanned microfilms\ntirelessly, every now and then setting one aside.\n  \n \n  Celeste watched him for a minute, then sprang up and started toward the\nroom where Dotty was asleep. But midway she stopped.\n  \n \n \n   Not my child\n   \n  , she thought bitterly.\n   \n   Frieda's her mother, Rosalind\nher nurse. I'm nothing at all. Just one of the husband's girl friends.\nA lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world.\n   \n \n \n  But then she straightened her shoulders and went on.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,\nhe was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded\npolitely.\n  \n \n  \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.\n\"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first\ngiant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little\nhotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned\naround and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his\ntail between his legs.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what he did!\"\n  \n \n  To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme\nunderstatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by\nsaying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac\nto watchful spy.\n  \n \n  I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the\nroom and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and\nsuddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" I said.\n  \n \n  He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn\nfools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n  \n \n  He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to\nanswer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't\nknow, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Military equipment?\n   \n   What\n   \n  military equipment? Your Army is supplied\nwith uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the\nrocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what\nother defenses are there? None.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had\nadequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy\nspy.\n  \n \n  \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what are\n   \n   they\n   \n  supposed to spy on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even\nanswer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by\none of the other projects.\"\n  \n \n  \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified\ninformation.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's\nwhat\n   \n   your\n   \n  spies are doing, and if\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  a spy, then it follows that\nI'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for\nindications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n  \n \n  He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's\n   \n   not\n   \n  my\njob, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I\n   \n   were\n   \n  a spy,\n   \n   then\n   \n  that would be my job!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female\nreceptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the\nhundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she\nwere growing very used to saying it.\n  \n \n  It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean\ndisconnected? Elevators don't\n   \n   get\n   \n  disconnected!\" I told her.\n  \n \n  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing\nwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n  \n \n  I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,\ngiving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as\nrationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me\n   \n   why\n   \n  the elevator is disconnected?\"\n  \n \n  \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her\nlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly\nat her screen and parroted her responses.\n  \n \n  But now she was actually looking at\n   \n   me\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I\nwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just\nwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have\nruined my life.\"\n  \n \n  She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly\nthan before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom\nI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too\npreoccupied to notice it at the time.\n  \n \n  \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,\na fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten\no'clock.\n   \n   I'm late!\n   \n  \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize\nwhat you've\n   \n   done\n   \n  , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she\nmarry me, she won't even\n   \n   speak\n   \n  to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not shouting!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   understand\n   \n  ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n  \n \n  She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,\nrevealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay\nany attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,\nsir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll\nunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it\nhad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"\nshe leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was my turn to be stunned.\n  \n \n  I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n  \n \n  \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and\nmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He\njammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think\nof to get him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n  \n \n  \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from\noutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims\nthe elevator at them.\"\n  \n \n  That sounded impossible. \"He\n   \n   aims\n   \n  the elevator?\"\n  \n \n  \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush\nanybody who goes after him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n  \n \n  She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could\nhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're\nafraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she\nglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n  \n \n  For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been\ntold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all\nthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n  \n \n  What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting\nthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many\nmore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n  \n \n  Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had\nno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and\ncompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our\nroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present\nthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other\npeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't\nreturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the\nbuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny\nradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and\nbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might\nbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And\nwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers\nmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external\ndangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.\nKilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n  \n \n  Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years\nold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.\nThere was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as\nWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.\n  \n \n  The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of\nmany many factors, but two of the most important were the population\nexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,\nmeant that there was continuously more and more people but never any\nmore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one\ncentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to\nvertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in\ntiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,\n   \n   everybody\n   \n  lived in\nProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make\nthese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,\nshopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of\nother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely\nself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,\nseparate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot\nore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the\nProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,\nthe population explosion.\n  \n \n  And the Treaty of Oslo.\n  \n \n  It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing\nnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of\nvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty\nof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added\nthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only\n   \n   tactical\n   \n  atomic\nweapons could be used. No\n   \n   strategic\n   \n  atomic weapons. (A tactical\nweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is\nsomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody\ndid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which\nmeant that no Projects were bombed.\n  \n \n  Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical\natomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole\nworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or\nat least those of them which had in time installed the force screens\nwhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected\nradioactive particles.\n  \n \n  However, what with all of the\n   \n   other\n   \n  treaties which were broken during\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody\nwas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there\non the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since\nthey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to\nask.\n  \n \n  And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking\nOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\nwas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it\ngo at that.\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman.

What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "      It was one of those days when everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. Edmund Rice, the main character, has decided to propose to his girlfriend, Linda on the day when the story takes place, but at breakfast, he broke his egg yolk; he had a stuck zipper; he had feedback in the aircon exhaust; and his window stuck at full transparency. On top of all that, the elevator is late. Edmund\u2019s girlfriend is a dispatcher for ore-sled robots; when one doesn\u2019t return on time, they know that the robot has been been captured and therefore blown itself up. As a result, Linda is a real stickler for punctuality because if Edmund is late, as he was once before, she goes into hysterics thinking that something horrible has happened to him. \n     When the elevator doesn\u2019t come, Edmund goes back to his apartment to call Linda to let her know why he will be late, but she has set her phone not to accept calls since she was expecting Edmund to come propose to her. Edmund decides to complain to the Transit Staff, who give him the official statement that the elevator is disconnected, but when Edmund explains that the late elevator is ruining his life, the operator takes pity on him and secretly tells him there is a spy on the elevator who won\u2019t get off, and the Army might have to starve him to make him exit. Finally, at 10:15, Edmund thinks of taking the stairs, but when he does, the spy intercepts him, forcing him at gunpoint back to Edmund\u2019s apartment. At this point, Edmund gives up on reaching Linda.\n     The spy tells Edmund he doesn\u2019t want to hurt him and begins a conversation, asking what Edmund does for a living. Because Edmund doesn\u2019t want the spy to know that he teaches gymnastics and knows wrestling, judo, and karati, he lies and tells him he is an ore-sled operator, figuring he can pull off the ruse since he knows a lot about Linda\u2019s job. This piques the spy\u2019s interest, and he asks what Edmund knows about the radiation level of the ore-sleds when they return. Edmund says they don\u2019t check for radiation before de-radiating the sled; there\u2019s no point. The spy is irritated that Edmund doesn\u2019t even care about the radiation level outside the Project and compares the Projects to caves. \nThe spy goes on to tell Edmund he isn\u2019t a spy, that he is an atomic engineer from a Project 80 miles north. He traveled to Edmund\u2019s Project on foot without any kind of radiation shield to prove that the radiation level is so low that it is safe for people to leaves the Projects. He is trying to get the word out, but people don\u2019t believe him because their Commissions tell them the radiation level is still high and that it isn\u2019t safe to go outside. Edmund thinks the man is a lunatic and doesn\u2019t believe any of the ludicrous claims he makes.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Edmund Rice lives in one of the Projects and has finally decided to propose to his girlfriend for a Non-P marriage. He set the time with her before, 10 o\u2019clock sharp, and prepared himself that morning. He steps outside his apartment with a few minutes to spare but soon realizes that the elevator isn\u2019t working. He waits for a minute or two, starting to freak out, then rushes inside to call Linda and warn her. She hates tardiness because of her job as an ore-sled dispatcher, and he didn\u2019t want to upset her on the big day. Her landline was disconnected for privacy\u2019s sake, so he couldn\u2019t let her know. He runs back to the elevator and keeps trying, but to no avail. Officially late, he goes back to his apartment and calls the Transit Staff. A young woman picks up and robotically tells him that the elevator will be back in service soon. He yells at her, eventually explaining why she has ruined his life, and she responds sympathetically, clearly a romantic. She leans forward and tells him the truth: there\u2019s a spy in the elevator. He is in shock, but she explains the whole situation and how they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll have to starve him out. Finished, she hangs up, and Edmund runs back to the elevator in the hopes that they successfully removed him. \nHe is saddened to find it still not working, so he decides to take the stairs, which no one does. A few landings down, he sees a door with faint lettering on it, explaining that this once led to the elevator shaft. He wonders briefly why no one is guarding it, and then suddenly the spy comes out of the door. The spy holds a gun up to his head and tells him to stay quiet and take him back to his room. They return to the 153rd floor, and Edmund harbors him in his apartment. The spy asks for a cup of Chico coffee, which saddens Edmund as he only gets two cups a day. Edmund lies about his identity and pretends he\u2019s an ore-sled dispatcher, like Linda. He is, in fact, a gymnast instructor with martial arts abilities, but he wants to have the advantage of surprise should the situation take a violent turn. \nThey chat while Edmund makes him the coffee, and the spy grows agitated and manic. He tries to explain to Edmund that he\u2019s not really a spy. He actually came from another Project 80 miles away on foot. He is the proof that the radiation levels outside have dramatically decreased, making it safe for humans to go outside again. However, the Commission doesn\u2019t want the world to know that as then they would quickly go out of business. The spy reveals he\u2019s an atomic engineer, and the story ends on a slight cliffhanger. \n",
        "Summary_3": "In the years following World War III, atomic radiation and rapid population growth had led nations to develop vertically rather than horizontally, and people lived together in massive high-rises called Projects where they could live, work, and play while never having to go Outside and face the dangers of radiation. Only ore-sleds and spies leave the buildings--the ore-sleds to gather essential raw materials impossible to produce in the Projects, and the spies to visit other Projects to learn about potential attacks on their home Project. Edmund Rice is a gymnast instructor who lives on the hundred fifty-third floor of one of these Projects. He plans to propose Non-Permanent marriage to his girlfriend Linda, who is an ore-sled dispatcher obsessed with punctuality. The morning of his planned proposal, set for 10:00 sharp, Edmund goes to the elevator to travel down to Linda's hundred fortieth floor and discovers the elevator is unresponsive. He continues pressing the button to no avail. He runs back to his apartment to alert Linda and discovers her phone has a \"privacy disconnection\" notice, probably placed because Linda expected Edmund's proposal. When the elevator continuously fails to arrive, Edmund calls the Transit Staff to inquire what is going wrong. The staff person informs him that a spy has penetrated the Project force-screen and is barricading himself in the elevator. Using manual controls, the spy wields the elevator like a projectile weapon against any soldier that approaches. Stunned, Edmund makes a last-ditch effort to reach Linda. He uses the stairs, an option he hasn't taken since he was a young child. A few flights down, he sees an emergency exit from the elevator, and the spy emerges from it. The spy holds him at gun point and leads him back to his apartment, where the two men share a coffee. The spy reveals he is not a spy at all; rather, he is a trained atomic engineer who claims radiation levels have reduced to such an extent that people may now safely venture Outside. The reason this is not common knowledge is because the Commission suppresses the truth so that is may keep making money from the continued operation of the Projects.",
        "Summary_4": "Some time after the year 2100, humans live in vertical buildings called Projects that are completely isolated from each other and nations unto themselves. Decades ago, the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War involved so much atomic bombing that the radiation levels outside are said to be too unsafe for humans. The Projects are all suspicious of each other, supposedly sending spies out to see whether attacks are being planned. There hasn\u2019t been an attack in decades, and the external threats largely just exist as fears in the minds of the people.\nEdmund Rice leaves his 153rd floor apartment in his Project at five minutes to ten to propose to an ore-sled dispatcher who lives on the 144th floor that he is deeply in love with named Linda. He plans to propose a Non-P marriage (Non-Permanent, No Progeny) since neither of them are genetically desirable enough to have children in their society, and he knows that Linda wants to keep her independence. The ten o\u2019clock time of the appointment is significant because Linda is so punctual that Edmund believes she will not marry him if he is late. However, the elevator is not working and does not respond to pressing the button and kicking the door. Becoming frantic, he runs back to his apartment and calls Linda, but she does not answer. She likely disconnected her phone because she wanted to have no interruptions when Edmund arrived. He furiously calls the Transit Staff to file a complaint, and tells the woman that his life has been ruined. She feels bad for him and tells him secret information that there is a spy in the elevator and that the Army thinks they may have to starve him out. Edmund then realizes he can take an ancient thing called the stairs. He rushes to the staircase even though it is already quarter past ten and races down. He spots a door to the elevator shaft on the landing between the 150th and 149th floors, and a man -the spy- bursts out of it. The spy uses a gun to threaten Edmund and forces him to take them both back to hide in Edmund\u2019s apartment to lose the Army that had been racing up the stairs behind them. In the apartment, the spy asks Edmund to make him a cup of coffee and begins a conversation, acting like a maniac in Edmund\u2019s perception at times. The spy reveals he is an atomic engineer who worked on the reactor in his own Project. He calculated that the radiation from the war decades ago must have subsided, and it would be safe for humans to leave the Projects and resume progress on other advances like space travel. The Commission would not let him test the theory, so he risked his life by traveling outside to determine if it was indeed true. His survival of the crossing is proof that the radiation is low enough for humans to survive outside, and Edmund can hardly believe what he is hearing."

        "Query": "What role does Linda play in THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR and why is she important to the plot?",
        "Article": "But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n  \n \n  When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how\nmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls\nwere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the\nother side of them.\n  \n \n  I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n  \n \n  I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.\nI dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the\nelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda\nwould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient\nreason for me to be late.\n  \n \n  He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n  \n \n  I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the\ndoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n  \n \n  I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs\nexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and\ndown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of\nstairs since I was twelve years old.\n  \n \n  Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,\ndidn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was\nthe use of stairs?\n  \n \n  Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary\ninformation), the Project had been built when there still had been such\nthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which\nwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government\nhad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which\nrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the\ncity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n  \n \n  And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after\nall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a\nflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n  \n \n  Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.\nIf the door would open.\n  \n \n  It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since\nlast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and\nfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,\ntook a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight\nsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n  \n \n  On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a\nsmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one\ntime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked\naway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered\nthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with\ndifficulty.\n  \n \n  I read them. They said:\n  \n \n  EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n   \n  ELEVATOR SHAFT\n   \n  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n   \n  ONLY\n   \n  KEEP LOCKED\n  \n \n  I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly\nguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible\nanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply\nhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed\nshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.\nSomebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n  \n \n  As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and\nthe spy came out, waving a gun.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first\nplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,\nin the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the\nelevator shaft.\n  \n \n  Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we\ncame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n  \n \n  He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun\nstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't\nmove!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n  \n \n  I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.\nWhich left me quite free to study him.\n  \n \n  He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony\nhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He\nwore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked\nexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he\n   \n   didn't\n   \n  look like a\nspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he\nreminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to\nmy parents' apartment.\n  \n \n  His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand\nat the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n  \n \n  I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from\nperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the\nopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending\nboots. The Army!\n  \n \n  But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He\nsaid, \"Where do you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.\nI knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions\npromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to\neither escape or capture him.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n  \n \n  And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at\nthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,\nand grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one\nfalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're\nfriends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n  \n \n  I nodded.\n  \n \n  \"All right. Let's go.\"\n  \n \n  We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as\nit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one\nemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I\nthumbed the door open and we went inside.\n  \n \n  Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against\nthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile\nplaying across his lips.\n  \n \n  I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could\nleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have\nread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He\nsaid, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill\nanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until\nthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able\nto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any\nsilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n  \n \n  \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got\nany chico coffee?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with\nboiling water.\"\n  \n \n  \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two\ncups, lunch and dinner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from\nruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very\nwell throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment\nand I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that\ngaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories\nstraight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal\nspeeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n  \n \n  I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little\nNon-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a\nRomantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.\nTemporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life\nwith you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a\nStraightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at\nleast a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend\nthat time with than you.\"\n  \n \n  Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less\nto anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we\nboth had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that\nLinda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract\nfor any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n  \n \n  So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time\ncame I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more\nthan a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and\nmalfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment\nat five minutes to ten.\n  \n \n  Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.\nIt never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I\nwas giving myself plenty of time.\n  \n \n  But then the elevator didn't come.\n  \n \n  I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't\nunderstand it.\n  \n \n  The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of\nthe button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator\nthat traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred\nsixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for\neither the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than\ntwenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n  \n \n  I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my\nwatch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If\nit didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n  \n \n  It didn't arrive.\n  \n \n  I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator\nwould come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to\ngive her advance warning that I would be late?\n  \n \n  Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second\nalternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my\napartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white\nletters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n  \n \n  Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted\nto say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to\nkeep us from being interrupted.\n  \n \n  Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the\nelevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if\nthe elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute\nlate.\n  \n \n  No matter. It didn't arrive.\n  \n \n  I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility\npiled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day\nwas just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door\nthree times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was\nhurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the\ndoor behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of\nthe Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud\nthey'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n  \n \n  I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR\n  \n \n  By DONALD E. WESTLAKE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEST\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n \n   He was dangerously insane. He threatened\n    \n   to destroy everything that was noble and\n    \n   decent\u2014including my date with my girl!\n   \n \n \n \n  When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken\negg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window\nsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry\nlist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put\nthe roof on the city, as they say.\n  \n \n  It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're\nlucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n  \n \n  But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been\nbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my\nmind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this\nmorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her\nplace. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the\nphone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten\no'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n  \n \n  Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a\nharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a\nfixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,\nof course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,\nwere invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one\nwaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other\nProject and had blown itself up.\n  \n \n  Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three\nyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,\nshortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five\nminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been\nkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from\narriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had\nhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four\ndays.\n  \n \n  And then the elevator didn't come.\n  \n<doc-sep>It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female\nreceptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the\nhundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she\nwere growing very used to saying it.\n  \n \n  It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean\ndisconnected? Elevators don't\n   \n   get\n   \n  disconnected!\" I told her.\n  \n \n  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing\nwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n  \n \n  I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,\ngiving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as\nrationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me\n   \n   why\n   \n  the elevator is disconnected?\"\n  \n \n  \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her\nlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly\nat her screen and parroted her responses.\n  \n \n  But now she was actually looking at\n   \n   me\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I\nwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just\nwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have\nruined my life.\"\n  \n \n  She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly\nthan before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom\nI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too\npreoccupied to notice it at the time.\n  \n \n  \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,\na fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten\no'clock.\n   \n   I'm late!\n   \n  \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize\nwhat you've\n   \n   done\n   \n  , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she\nmarry me, she won't even\n   \n   speak\n   \n  to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not shouting!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   understand\n   \n  ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n  \n \n  She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,\nrevealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay\nany attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,\nsir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll\nunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it\nhad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"\nshe leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was my turn to be stunned.\n  \n \n  I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n  \n \n  \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and\nmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He\njammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think\nof to get him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n  \n \n  \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from\noutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims\nthe elevator at them.\"\n  \n \n  That sounded impossible. \"He\n   \n   aims\n   \n  the elevator?\"\n  \n \n  \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush\nanybody who goes after him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n  \n \n  She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could\nhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're\nafraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she\nglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n  \n \n  For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been\ntold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all\nthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n  \n \n  What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting\nthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many\nmore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n  \n \n  Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had\nno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and\ncompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our\nroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present\nthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other\npeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't\nreturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the\nbuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny\nradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and\nbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might\nbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And\nwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers\nmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external\ndangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.\nKilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n  \n \n  Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years\nold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.\nThere was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as\nWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.\n  \n \n  The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of\nmany many factors, but two of the most important were the population\nexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,\nmeant that there was continuously more and more people but never any\nmore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one\ncentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to\nvertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in\ntiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,\n   \n   everybody\n   \n  lived in\nProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make\nthese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,\nshopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of\nother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely\nself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,\nseparate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot\nore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the\nProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,\nthe population explosion.\n  \n \n  And the Treaty of Oslo.\n  \n \n  It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing\nnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of\nvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty\nof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added\nthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only\n   \n   tactical\n   \n  atomic\nweapons could be used. No\n   \n   strategic\n   \n  atomic weapons. (A tactical\nweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is\nsomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody\ndid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which\nmeant that no Projects were bombed.\n  \n \n  Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical\natomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole\nworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or\nat least those of them which had in time installed the force screens\nwhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected\nradioactive particles.\n  \n \n  However, what with all of the\n   \n   other\n   \n  treaties which were broken during\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody\nwas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there\non the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since\nthey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to\nask.\n  \n \n  And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking\nOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\nwas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it\ngo at that.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>In a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven\no'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\nof her first day's spying.\n  \n \n  No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\nwas set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\nPerhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\nhad her phone tapped.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n  \n \n  Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\nDo you read me? Over.\"\n  \n \n  Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n  \n \n  The room was empty.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n  \n \n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n  \n \n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n  \n \n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n  \n \n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n  \n \n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n  \n \n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n  \n \n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n  \n \n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\n  \n<doc-sep>And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which\nreminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't\n   \n   ever\n   \n  going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me\nand might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n  \n \n  As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,\n\"What do you do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,\nof course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda\nto be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about\nit.\n  \n \n  Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included\nwrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him\nin my own fashion, when the time came.\n  \n \n  He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the\nore-sleds?\"\n  \n \n  I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n  \n \n  \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?\nDon't you people ever test them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's\ninformation to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and\ntheir cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them\nbefore de-radiating them?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"No. Why should we?\"\n  \n \n  \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n  \n \n  \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n  \n \n  He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself\nthan to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into\nyour caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n  \n \n  I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with\na fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n  \n \n  Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of\ncourse not!\"\n  \n \n  \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same\nstupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out\nof the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,\nbefore he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it\ntook for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He\nstarted pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion\nas he talked. \"Is this the\n   \n   natural\n   \n  life of man? It is not. Is this\neven a\n   \n   desirable\n   \n  life for man? It is\n   \n   definitely\n   \n  not.\" He spun back\nto face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed\nit as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.\n\"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was\ngrowing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all\nthe time. He was planning to tackle\n   \n   space\n   \n  !

And Man was reaching\nout for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it.\n  \n<doc-sep>I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,\nhe was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded\npolitely.\n  \n \n  \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.\n\"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first\ngiant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little\nhotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned\naround and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his\ntail between his legs.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what he did!\"\n  \n \n  To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme\nunderstatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by\nsaying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac\nto watchful spy.\n  \n \n  I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the\nroom and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and\nsuddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" I said.\n  \n \n  He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn\nfools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n  \n \n  He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to\nanswer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't\nknow, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Military equipment?\n   \n   What\n   \n  military equipment? Your Army is supplied\nwith uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the\nrocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what\nother defenses are there? None.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had\nadequate defense equipment.

        "Summary_1": "     Linda is the woman to whom Edmund intends to propose. She is the reason Edmund is trying to get on the elevator and why he ultimately decides to take the stairs, leading him to meet the spy. Linda\u2019s job as an ore-sled operator has left her high-strung when it comes to punctuality. She sends robots out with ore-sleds, and when they don\u2019t return on time, they know that the robot has been captured and has blown itself up to prevent other Projects from learning their technology secrets. Once when Edmund was late for a date with her, Linda worked herself into hysterics, and when he did show up, she refused to speak to Edmund for four days. \n\tEdmund has spent months building up the courage to propose to Linda, and the day he plans to do it, everything goes awry, making him run late. But he still reaches the elevator in time to reach Linda\u2019s place thirteen stories below his level on time, except the elevator doesn\u2019t come. The longer he waits for the elevator car, the more anxious Edmund grows, knowing that Linda will be so upset if he is late he won\u2019t get to propose.\n\tEdmund loves Linda and would like to have a permanent marriage, but he realizes that Linda enjoys her freedom and independence too much to agree to a permanent marriage. Edmund will settle for a Non-P marriage with her: Non-Permanent, No Progeny. \n\tLinda anticipates Edmund\u2019s proposal when he calls that morning to invite himself to her apartment. He can tell by her smile on the phone. In preparation for the proposal, Linda has set her phone to PRIVACY DISCONNECTION to prevent their proposal from being interrupted, but this also means that Edmund cannot reach her to let her know he is running late and why. Edmund is convinced that she won\u2019t speak to him again after being late for the proposal and certainly will not accept his proposal. In a last-ditch effort to reach Linda, Edmund decides he can take 208 stairs to reach her, even though he hasn\u2019t taken the stairs since he was 12 years old. This decision, of course, puts him in the path to run into the spy.\n\tFinally, Linda\u2019s job helps Edmund believe he can overtake the spy if he can catch him off guard. Edmund knows enough about her job to talk about it with the spy, keeping his knowledge of wrestling, judo, and karate secret until he can make his move.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Linda is Edmund Rice\u2019s fiance\u00e9-to-be and current girlfriend. They have been together presumably for quite some time, as he knows quite a bit about her. Her one flaw, as he likes to say, is her absolute adherence to punctuality. Edmund recalls when he was late to meet her by a few minutes, and she broke down in tears thinking he had died. Her adherence comes from her job as an ore-sled dispatcher; when an ore-sled doesn\u2019t return, it means the sled has been captured or destroyed. Linda is a very independent woman and, according to Edmund, would never into a long-term marriage, only a Non-P marriage (Non-Permanent and No Progeny). \nLinda is significant to the story because she provides the basis for conflict. Edmund is on his way to propose to Linda when he realizes the elevator is stuck. He realizes he will be late and freaks out, which leads him on the path to running into the so-called spy. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Linda is Edmund Rice's girlfriend who works as an ore-dispatcher at the same Project where Edmund lives. She lives on Floor 140 while Edmund lives on 153, and he frequently visits her using the local elevator. Due to the nature of her work, Linda has developed an obsession with punctuality, and she cannot handle the smallest deviation from set appointment times. Once, she and Edmund had first started dating, Edmund arrived at her apartment five minutes late to find Linda in complete hysterics; she thought Edmund had been killed. When Edmund explained he had simply been late, she didn't speak to him for four days. This explains Edmund's panic when the elevator fails to arrive the morning he plans to propose to Linda at 10:00 precisely. Linda anticipates the proposal, so she switches her phone to \"privacy disconnection\" mode in order to prevent them from being disturbed when Edmunds pops the question. Although Edmund will not admit that he loves Linda in more than a Non-Permanent way, he understands that Linda cherishes her freedom and independence, so he plans for his proposal to be of the Non-Permanent, No Progeny variety.",
        "Summary_4": "Linda is an ore-sled dispatcher, and after three years working in the profession has become quite obsessed with punctuality. If the ore-sleds aren\u2019t on time, nobody waits for them. They are assumed to be blown up or captured by other Projects. She does not accept tardiness with ease, and once gave Edmund Rice the silent treatment for four days when he was late to meet her. She is in a relationship with Edmund, and expects that he will propose marriage to her when he tells her he has something important to talk about. \nShe is significant to the story because her punctuality places great stress on Edmund when he knows he will be late. This causes him to frantically panic when the elevator is not working, and resort to using the stairwell to attempt to meet with her before their relationship deteriorates beyond repair. Linda\u2019s reaction to tardiness is very strict, evidenced when Edmund describes to the Transit Staff when he files a complaint about the elevator that they have ruined his life and that Linda will no longer speak to him or even consider marrying him. Because Linda means so much to Edmund, he continues to try to get to her even when he knows he is over 15 minutes late. Trying the stairwell as his final effort to be with Linda causes him to run into the spy escaping the elevator shaft, which is the climax of the story. It is not revealed what happens between Linda and Edmund in the end.\n"

        "Query": "What are the physical and social settings in \"The Spy in the Elevator\" after World Wars I, II, and III?",
        "Article": "But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n  \n \n  When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how\nmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls\nwere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the\nother side of them.\n  \n \n  I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n  \n \n  I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.\nI dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the\nelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda\nwould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient\nreason for me to be late.\n  \n \n  He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n  \n \n  I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the\ndoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n  \n \n  I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs\nexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and\ndown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of\nstairs since I was twelve years old.\n  \n \n  Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,\ndidn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was\nthe use of stairs?\n  \n \n  Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary\ninformation), the Project had been built when there still had been such\nthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which\nwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government\nhad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which\nrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the\ncity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n  \n \n  And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after\nall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a\nflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n  \n \n  Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.\nIf the door would open.\n  \n \n  It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since\nlast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and\nfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,\ntook a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight\nsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n  \n \n  On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a\nsmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one\ntime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked\naway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered\nthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with\ndifficulty.\n  \n \n  I read them. They said:\n  \n \n  EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n   \n  ELEVATOR SHAFT\n   \n  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n   \n  ONLY\n   \n  KEEP LOCKED\n  \n \n  I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly\nguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible\nanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply\nhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed\nshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.\nSomebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n  \n \n  As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and\nthe spy came out, waving a gun.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first\nplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,\nin the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the\nelevator shaft.\n  \n \n  Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we\ncame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n  \n \n  He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun\nstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't\nmove!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n  \n \n  I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.\nWhich left me quite free to study him.\n  \n \n  He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony\nhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He\nwore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked\nexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he\n   \n   didn't\n   \n  look like a\nspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he\nreminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to\nmy parents' apartment.\n  \n \n  His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand\nat the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n  \n \n  I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from\nperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the\nopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending\nboots. The Army!\n  \n \n  But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He\nsaid, \"Where do you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.\nI knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions\npromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to\neither escape or capture him.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n  \n \n  And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at\nthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,\nand grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one\nfalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're\nfriends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n  \n \n  I nodded.\n  \n \n  \"All right. Let's go.\"\n  \n \n  We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as\nit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one\nemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I\nthumbed the door open and we went inside.\n  \n \n  Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against\nthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile\nplaying across his lips.\n  \n \n  I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could\nleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have\nread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He\nsaid, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill\nanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until\nthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able\nto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any\nsilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n  \n \n  \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got\nany chico coffee?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with\nboiling water.\"\n  \n \n  \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two\ncups, lunch and dinner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,\nhe was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded\npolitely.\n  \n \n  \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.\n\"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first\ngiant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little\nhotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did.

If I\n   \n   were\n   \n  a spy,\n   \n   then\n   \n  that would be my job!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female\nreceptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the\nhundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she\nwere growing very used to saying it.\n  \n \n  It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean\ndisconnected? Elevators don't\n   \n   get\n   \n  disconnected!\" I told her.\n  \n \n  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing\nwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n  \n \n  I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,\ngiving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as\nrationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me\n   \n   why\n   \n  the elevator is disconnected?\"\n  \n \n  \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her\nlooking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly\nat her screen and parroted her responses.\n  \n \n  But now she was actually looking at\n   \n   me\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I\nwould like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just\nwhat you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have\nruined my life.\"\n  \n \n  She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly\nthan before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom\nI dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too\npreoccupied to notice it at the time.\n  \n \n  \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,\na fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten\no'clock.\n   \n   I'm late!\n   \n  \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize\nwhat you've\n   \n   done\n   \n  , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she\nmarry me, she won't even\n   \n   speak\n   \n  to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not shouting!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   understand\n   \n  ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n  \n \n  She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,\nrevealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay\nany attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,\nsir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll\nunderstand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it\nhad to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"\nshe leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was my turn to be stunned.\n  \n \n  I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n  \n \n  \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and\nmanaged to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He\njammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think\nof to get him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n  \n \n  \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from\noutside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims\nthe elevator at them.\"\n  \n \n  That sounded impossible. \"He\n   \n   aims\n   \n  the elevator?\"\n  \n \n  \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush\nanybody who goes after him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n  \n \n  She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could\nhardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're\nafraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she\nglanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n  \n \n  For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been\ntold. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all\nthe way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n  \n \n  What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting\nthat lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many\nmore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n  \n \n  Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had\nno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and\ncompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our\nroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present\nthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other\npeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't\nreturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the\nbuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny\nradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and\nbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might\nbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And\nwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers\nmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external\ndangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.\nKilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n  \n \n  Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years\nold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.\nThere was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as\nWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.\n  \n \n  The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of\nmany many factors, but two of the most important were the population\nexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,\nmeant that there was continuously more and more people but never any\nmore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one\ncentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to\nvertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in\ntiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,\n   \n   everybody\n   \n  lived in\nProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make\nthese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,\nshopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of\nother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely\nself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,\nseparate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot\nore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the\nProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,\nthe population explosion.\n  \n \n  And the Treaty of Oslo.\n  \n \n  It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing\nnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of\nvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty\nof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added\nthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only\n   \n   tactical\n   \n  atomic\nweapons could be used. No\n   \n   strategic\n   \n  atomic weapons. (A tactical\nweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is\nsomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody\ndid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which\nmeant that no Projects were bombed.\n  \n \n  Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical\natomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole\nworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or\nat least those of them which had in time installed the force screens\nwhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected\nradioactive particles.\n  \n \n  However, what with all of the\n   \n   other\n   \n  treaties which were broken during\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody\nwas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there\non the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since\nthey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to\nask.\n  \n \n  And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking\nOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\nwas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it\ngo at that.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Eleven\no'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\nof her first day's spying.\n  \n \n  No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\nwas set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\nPerhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\nhad her phone tapped.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n  \n \n  Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\nDo you read me? Over.\"\n  \n \n  Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n  \n \n  The room was empty.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n  \n \n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n  \n \n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n  \n \n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n  \n \n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n  \n \n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n  \n \n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n  \n \n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n  \n \n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her.

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place some time after the year 2100, after World Wars I, II, and III have been fought. Due to the population explosion, by 2000, everyone lived in Projects. These Projects are vertically expanded buildings housing people on floors numbering up to two hundred; the Projects are self-contained and self-sufficient. The people in them do not have to go outside where they fear radiation from atomic bombs used in the wars still exists. The Projects provide restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners, schools, churches, factories, etc. Food is grown hydroponically. The Projects are protected by force screens that deflect the radiation and all have their own armies that are supposed to protect them from spies from other Projects.\n\tThe Projects have advanced technology. Telephones have visual capability that allows callers to see each other; this is how Edmund knows that Linda anticipates his proposal. They have robots that mine and collect ore using ore-sleds. The robots are equipped to self-detonate if they are captured. \n\tThe Projects are suspicious of each other because so many treaties were broken during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman\u2019s War, so Projects aren\u2019t willing to expose themself to the possible dangers of reaching out or allying with other Projects. The Army practices Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness in case of danger, allowing the people in the Projects to just live their lives.The Treaty of Oslo provides a sense of safety because it means that Projects will not be bombed in case of war.\n\tSocially, not all marriages are intended to be permanent, especially if the couple is not genetically desirable. There is a Non-P marriage option in this case: Non-Permanent and No Progeny. In Non-P marriages, people contract to marry for a short term, such as one or two years. People are also scared of strangers; hence, the man in the elevator is deemed a spy before anyone even speaks with him.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Spy in the Elevator by Donald E. Westlake takes place in the century after the year 2000. After the third of the Ungentelamnly Wars, AKA World War III, Earth was scorched and full of radiation. The remaining population moved into self-sustaining Projects that feature 200+ floors of residential housing, churches, gyms, caf\u00e9s, and even a hydroponic farm in the basement. Humans were locked away due to the deadly levels of radiation outside due to the tactical atomic bombings. Each Project defends itself with an Army and various equipment as no one is sure whether or not another Project will attack. \nThe Project that Edmund Rice and Linda live in has 200 floors and features all the normal amenities. The elevator, however, is the main source of travel, and no one uses the stairs anymore. Edmund\u2019s room is modest, and he receives a small supply of food daily to prevent any waste. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Projects had been developed as a result of population booms and the Treaty of Oslo following Word War III, cheekily called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War by Edmunds Intermediate Project History teacher Dr. Kilbillie. Prior to 1900, everyone lived in small, one-to-five-story homes. By the year 2000, everyone lived in the giant high-rises called Projects, also known as apartments or co-ops. The Projects were several hundred stories tall and were essential compact nations that included restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners, etc. Eventually, the Projects became self-sustaining and added schools, churches, factories, robot ore-sleds, etc. The Treaty of Oslo disallowed deployment of strategic atomic weapons and only permitted the use of tactical weapons, which resulted in the world's current state of omnipresent radiation. In the years since, no one has left the buildings to go Outside, except the ore-sleds that seek out raw materials and the spies that invade the protective force-screens to seek out information about potential attacks from other Projects. The residents have developed a level of comfort with life in the Projects, even though they are only allotted a certain amount of food each day and can never leave. Later, the \"spy\" posits that the residents are being fed lies by the Commission, which runs the Projects and profits from their operation.\n",
        "Summary_4": "After the year 2100, humans live in Projects, which are self-sufficient vertical buildings that essentially govern themselves. Raw materials come in and out on ore-sleds and the humans in the Projects have no contact with the outside world. Vertical living became the norm because population explosion meant there was no more horizontal space for people to expand into. Then, with the onset of nuclear warfare in the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, the only safety for the public was to stay inside their residence in the Projects because of the Treaty of Oslo, which stipulates that in this era of atomic weapons, civilians are not to be targeted.\nThere has been so much atomic bombing that the radiation levels outside are said to be too unsafe for humans to endure. The Projects are suspicious of each other planning attacks, and there is high alert for spies from nearby projects infiltrating the building. The people within the Projects live in fear of atomic attacks, though they do not question the accuracy of what they have been told. There hasn\u2019t been an attack in decades, and this threat is largely now just a fear in the minds of the people. They go on with their daily lives, not checking to see if the radiation from the outside remains too high to go outdoors, but just believing what they are told. \nIn one Project, on the 153rd floor lives Edmund Rice in a nicely appointed apartment building, with a video calling service he can use to dial other residents and the building Transit Staff, and he receives allotted rations of food just as all of the other residents do. The love of his life that he wishes to propose Non-P marriage to, Linda, lives on the 144th floor of the same building. There is a local elevator that serves the higher floors that Edmund frequently uses, though it is out of order due to a spy jamming its controls and hiding inside it. There is a stairwell next to the elevator, and on a landing between the 150th and 149th floor there is a small door to the elevator shaft. \nThe spy - an atomic engineer from a neighboring Project - has discovered that the radiation is actually low outside and it is now safe for humans to venture out. However, for Edmund and many others, the Project is all that they know, and the idea of going outside is radically against what they have been conditioned to believe.\n"

        "Query": "What is the true identity and purpose of the \"spy\" in THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR story and how does he challenge the beliefs and way of life in the Projects?",
        "Article": "But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n  \n \n  When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how\nmany others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls\nwere our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the\nother side of them.\n  \n \n  I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n  \n \n  I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.\nI dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the\nelevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda\nwould agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient\nreason for me to be late.\n  \n \n  He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n  \n \n  I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the\ndoor to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n  \n \n  I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs\nexcept adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and\ndown from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of\nstairs since I was twelve years old.\n  \n \n  Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,\ndidn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was\nthe use of stairs?\n  \n \n  Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary\ninformation), the Project had been built when there still had been such\nthings as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which\nwere more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government\nhad had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which\nrequired a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the\ncity. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n  \n \n  And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after\nall. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a\nflight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n  \n \n  Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.\nIf the door would open.\n  \n \n  It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since\nlast this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and\nfinally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,\ntook a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight\nsteps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n  \n \n  On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a\nsmallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one\ntime letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked\naway, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered\nthe rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with\ndifficulty.\n  \n \n  I read them. They said:\n  \n \n  EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n   \n  ELEVATOR SHAFT\n   \n  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n   \n  ONLY\n   \n  KEEP LOCKED\n  \n \n  I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly\nguarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible\nanswers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply\nhave omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed\nshut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.\nSomebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n  \n \n  As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and\nthe spy came out, waving a gun.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first\nplace. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,\nin the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the\nelevator shaft.\n  \n \n  Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we\ncame face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us\nopen-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n  \n \n  He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun\nstopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't\nmove!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n  \n \n  I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.\nWhich left me quite free to study him.\n  \n \n  He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony\nhigh-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He\nwore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked\nexactly like a spy ... which is to say that he\n   \n   didn't\n   \n  look like a\nspy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he\nreminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to\nmy parents' apartment.\n  \n \n  His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand\nat the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n  \n \n  I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from\nperhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the\nopening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending\nboots. The Army!\n  \n \n  But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He\nsaid, \"Where do you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.\nI knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions\npromptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to\neither escape or capture him.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n  \n \n  And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at\nthe door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,\nand grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one\nfalse move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're\nfriends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n  \n \n  I nodded.\n  \n \n  \"All right. Let's go.\"\n  \n \n  We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as\nit was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one\nemerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I\nthumbed the door open and we went inside.\n  \n \n  Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against\nthe door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile\nplaying across his lips.\n  \n \n  I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could\nleap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have\nread my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He\nsaid, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill\nanybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until\nthe hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able\nto sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any\nsilly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n  \n \n  \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got\nany chico coffee?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with\nboiling water.\"\n  \n \n  \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two\ncups, lunch and dinner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,\nhe was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded\npolitely.\n  \n \n  \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.\n\"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first\ngiant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little\nhotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned\naround and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his\ntail between his legs.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what he did!\"\n  \n \n  To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme\nunderstatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by\nsaying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac\nto watchful spy.\n  \n \n  I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the\nroom and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and\nsuddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" I said.\n  \n \n  He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn\nfools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n  \n \n  He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to\nanswer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't\nknow, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Military equipment?\n   \n   What\n   \n  military equipment? Your Army is supplied\nwith uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the\nrocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what\nother defenses are there? None.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had\nadequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy\nspy.\n  \n \n  \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what are\n   \n   they\n   \n  supposed to spy on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even\nanswer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by\none of the other projects.\"\n  \n \n  \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified\ninformation.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's\nwhat\n   \n   your\n   \n  spies are doing, and if\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  a spy, then it follows that\nI'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for\nindications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n  \n \n  He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's\n   \n   not\n   \n  my\njob, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I\n   \n   were\n   \n  a spy,\n   \n   then\n   \n  that would be my job!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.\n\"All right, whatever you say.\"\n  \n \n  He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped\nback into the chair.\n  \n \n  He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then\nlooked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that\nI\n   \n   had\n   \n  found indications that you people were planning to attack my\nProject?\"\n  \n \n  I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to\nattack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n  \n \n  \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger\nagain. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for\nthis Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should\nyou think\n   \n   they\n   \n  might see some advantage in attacking\n   \n   you\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I\nsaid. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like\nall the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You\nthink I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That\nfathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm\n   \n   not\n   \n  a spy, and I'm\ngoing to tell you what I am.\"\n  \n \n  I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n  \n \n  \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.\nI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to\nprotect me.\"\n  \n \n  The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the\nviolence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n  \n \n  \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as\nlow as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been\nthat low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He\nleaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there\nnow. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building\nthe dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has\nthe horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the\npitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n  \n \n  And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I\ndidn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n  \n \n  \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked\non the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the\nradiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly\nhow much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted\nto test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed\npublic safety, but I knew better.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n<doc-sep>At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy\nlounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop\nof greased hair.\n  \n \n  \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung\nthe cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong\nwith burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that\nout, Hull?\"\n  \n \n  \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we\nheard....\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you hear?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who says so?\"\n  \n \n  The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to\nthe corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all\nnight.\"\n  \n \n  \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot.

        "Summary_1": "The spy thwarts Edmund\u2019s planned proposal to Linda, but on a larger scale, he threatens the entire way of life in the Projects. The spy in the elevator isn\u2019t really a spy, but the Army claims he is. It is in the interest of the Army and the Commissions of the Projects for people to believe that the radiation level outside the Projects is too high for people to survive because keeping people fearful keeps them in the Projects and needful of the Army and Commission. The people in the Projects are taught to be fearful of other Projects who might come and try to learn their secrets, military, technology, or otherwise. The Army is trying to capture the spy who has holed himself up in the elevator and is planning to starve him out if necessary. The spy uses logic to try to convince Edmund that he isn\u2019t really a spy, that the Projects don\u2019t really need to worry about spies, and that the Projects aren\u2019t really needed at all.\n\tThe spy is actually an atomic engineer from a Project about 80 miles north of Edmund\u2019s. He suspected that the radiation levels after the atomic war have dropped low enough to be safe for people to go outside the Projects. When he asks his Commission to be allowed to study this, he is refused. The Commission knows that if people can leave the Projects, there would be no need for the Commission. To secretly test his theory, the spy left his Project and walked all the way to Edmund\u2019s project without a radiation shield. He is fine, and he is trying to convince the people in the Projects that it is safe to go outside; he compares the Projects to caves and the people to cavemen. He claims that the Projects are stunting society\u2019s progress by keeping everyone \u201clocked down.\u201d\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The first conflict is caused by the spy in the elevator, as he prevents Edmund from visiting and therefore proposing to Linda on time. This causes a chain of events that leads to their eventual meeting and Edmund\u2019s partial captivity. While he harbors the alleged spy in his room after running into him on the stairwell, the spy reveals that he is not a spy at all. He came from a Project 80 miles away and walked to this one on foot. He claims the radiation levels are back to a healthy level and that they have been for years. He believes that the Commission is hiding the truth from people, because, if they knew, the Projects would go out of business, as people are not allowed to leave them for their own health and safety. ",
        "Summary_3": "When Edmund realizes the unmoving elevator is going to make him late for his proposal to Linda, he calls the Transit Staff. The staff person reveals to Edmund that a spy has barricaded himself in the elevator and with the help of manual controls is using it as a projectile against anyone who tries to get near him. Edmund had heard of spies going between Projects to try to learn information about any planned attacks, but he is surprised and scared to discover that a spy has managed to penetrate his Project's force-screen. He wonders what this will mean for the overall safety of the Project, but he doesn't dwell on this too long because he still needs to get to Linda. He makes his way down the stairs and encounters a small door, which turns out to be an emergency exit from the elevator shaft. The spy opens the shaft and orders Edmund to lead him back to his apartment at gunpoint. In the apartment, the spy demands coffee, and the two men talk. Edmund claims to be an ore-sled dispatcher, and the spy inquires if the dispatchers check radiation levels when the sleds return from a supply run. Edmund scoffs at this idea, claiming that there would be no point in doing so since the radiation is purged prior to entering the force-screen. The spy reveals himself to be an atomic engineer and tells Edmund that the Project defenses, as well as the claims of toxic radiation levels Outside, are nothing more than a smokescreen, a way to keep the residents of the Projects content to live inside and never venture out. He posits the Commission is responsible for this deception because they want to continue profiting from the operation of the Projects.",
        "Summary_4": "The spy is discovered on the 147th floor of Edmund\u2019s building, and runs into the elevator before the Army can catch him. The spy plugs the manual controls of the elevator so that he can\u2019t be caught, and runs the elevator up and down the shaft if anyone tries to enter the car through the shaft. After he bursts out of the elevator shaft door into the stairwell and forces Edmund to take him back to his apartment to hide, we learn the real story of the spy. He is actually an atomic engineer from another Project where he was in charge of their reactor. He thought the radiation from the war decades ago would likely be so low now that it would be safe for humans to leave the Projects and go outside. However, the Commission would not let him test the theory, so he risked his life to travel to a nearby Project to find out for himself. Because he survived the crossing outside, it is now safe for humans to resume activities outside. This is very significant, because Edmund\u2019s conditioning has him believe that there is no reason to question why they can\u2019t go outside and that there is not going to be a life outside the Project. The spy gives Edmund a reason to believe that what he has been told by the Commission is untrue. Also, the ability of the spy to penetrate so deeply into the project undetected is a significant concern to Edmund, who considers the reliability of the safeguards to keep the people safe from outside enemies.\n"

        "Article": "It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female\nreceptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the\nhundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she\nwere growing very used to saying it.\n  \n \n  It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected?

My bellowing\nwas bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n  \n \n  I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,\ngiving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as\nrationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me\n   \n   why\n   \n  the elevator is disconnected?\"\n  \n \n  \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her\nlooking at me.

I think it's perfectly awful that it\nhad to ruin things for you this way.

Who knew how many\nmore spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n  \n \n  Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had\nno reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and\ncompletely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our\nroof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present\nthreat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other\npeople either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't\nreturn, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the\nbuilding, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny\nradiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and\nbring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might\nbe planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And\nwithin the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers\nmerely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external\ndangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.\nKilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n  \n \n  Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years\nold\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.\nThere was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as\nWorld Wars One, Two, and Three.\n  \n \n  The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of\nmany many factors, but two of the most important were the population\nexplosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,\nmeant that there was continuously more and more people but never any\nmore space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one\ncentury, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to\nvertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in\ntiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,\n   \n   everybody\n   \n  lived in\nProjects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make\nthese Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,\nshopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of\nother adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely\nself-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,\nseparate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot\nore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the\nProjects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,\nthe population explosion.\n  \n \n  And the Treaty of Oslo.\n  \n \n  It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing\nnations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of\nvertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty\nof Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added\nthat just in case anyone happened to think of it only\n   \n   tactical\n   \n  atomic\nweapons could be used. No\n   \n   strategic\n   \n  atomic weapons. (A tactical\nweapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is\nsomething you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody\ndid think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which\nmeant that no Projects were bombed.\n  \n \n  Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical\natomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole\nworld was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or\nat least those of them which had in time installed the force screens\nwhich had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected\nradioactive particles.\n  \n \n  However, what with all of the\n   \n   other\n   \n  treaties which were broken during\nthe Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody\nwas quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there\non the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since\nthey weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to\nask.\n  \n \n  And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking\nOutside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness\nwas left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it\ngo at that.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty.

        "Summary_1": "Edmund is eager to propose to his girlfriend. He truly loves her and would like a long marriage, but he is willing to settle for a Non-P marriage since he knows she values her freedom and independence. After gathering the courage to propose, he makes a date with her one morning, but multiple minor calamities make him run late. Linda is a stickler for punctuality, so on this morning, it is especially important to be on time. When he makes it to the elevator with five minutes to spare, his proposal is thwarted because a spy is holding it up. When he tries to call Linda to let her know he is running late, he can\u2019t get the call through because she has set her phone not to be disturbed. When he learns that a spy is holding up the elevator and might be in there until the Army can starve him out, he decides to brave the 208 stairs down to Linda\u2019s apartment, only to run into the spy there. The spy forces Edmund back to his apartment, where he explains he is not really a spy and that the radiation levels outside are so low it is safe for everyone to leave the projects. Edmund is sure the man is a lunatic despite the logic of his argument. He realizes that his chance to marry Linda is gone; she will never forgive him for being late.",
        "Summary_2": "Edmund Rice is a gymnast and martial arts instructor living on the 153rd floor of one of the many Projects. He is in love with Linda, an ore-sled dispatcher who lives a few floors down from him, and wants to ask her to marry him. After eating his egg, he prepares himself to propose to Linda, reviewing his three speeches. He leaves with a few minutes to spare, but the elevator won\u2019t work. He watches hopefully as time ticks by and finally accepts that he\u2019s going to be late. He dashes back to his apartment to call Linda and warn her of his tardiness, but she has disconnected her landline. He goes back to the elevator, but still nothing. He storms home and calls the Transit Staff, yelling at the woman who picks up. After he shares his sob story, she reveals that the elevator isn\u2019t working because there\u2019s a spy in it who\u2019s taken over the control system. Realizing just how late he is, Edmund runs back out, tries the elevator again, and then decides to take the stairs. On one of the landings, he notices a door with faint letters on it. This door connects to the elevator shaft. Suddenly, the spy bursts through the door and holds Edmund at gunpoint. Edmund hides him in his room and is forced to make the spy a cup of Chico coffee as he tells his tale. Edmund disguises his identity and pretends he\u2019s an ore-sled dispatcher like Linda, so, if the time should come, he can take the so-called spy by surprise. ",
        "Summary_3": "Edmund Rice is a gymnast instructor specializing in wrestling, judo, and karati. He lives on the 153rd floor of a Project high-rise building and is preparing to propose to his girlfriend, Linda. Although he loves Linda and wants more than a Non-Permanent, No Progeny arrangement, he realizes she values her independence and plans to respect that. He has found a suitable Non-P apartment for them to share. Edmund's day is not going right. The egg yolk breaks when he prepares breakfast, his zipper sticks, the window is stuck open at full transparency. All of these minor problems are enhanced because he knows if he is even a minute late to his appointment with Linda, she will possibly think he is dead. Edmund gives himself plenty of time to get to the elevator, even though he knows the local and express elevators have a thirty-second arrival time, and it takes less than two minutes to get down to Linda's floor in the same building. When the elevator fails to arrive, Edmund panics. He tries to call Linda, but she has set the phone to private in anticipation of his proposal. Then, he calls the Transit Staff who tells him that the elevator is occupied by a spy, who has barricaded himself inside and is using the elevator as a projectile against anyone who might try to get him out. When Edmund tries to take the stairs to get to Linda, the spy stops him and leads him back to his apartment. Edmund attempts to mislead the spy by pretending to be an ore-sled dispatcher, but this only leads to the spy launching into a long diatribe against the existence of the Projects as smokescreens for the Commission wanting to maintain profits.",
        "Summary_4": "Edmund Rice is the narrating voice of the story, and so the events that occur to him in the story closely mirror the plot since it is all told from his perspective. Edmund is a gymnast instructor, skilled in wrestling, judo and karati. He lives on the 153rd floor of a self-sufficient vertical city building in which no one is supposed to enter or leave. There are many like it in the world, all called \u201cProjects\u201d. The world outside is said to be too dangerous to set foot in for humans because of the radiation from atomic bombs during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. \nHe is deeply in love with an ore-sled dispatcher on the 144th floor, Linda, and wants to propose a Non-P marriage to her (Non-Permanent, No Progeny). Neither of them are genetically desirable enough to have children, and he knows that Linda likes her independence too much to have a permanent marriage, even though he would like to have one with her. He makes an appointment to meet with her at ten o\u2019clock and propose. The time of the appointment is important because Linda is so critical of punctuality that Edmund thinks she will not marry him or even talk to him again if he is late. When he exits his apartment to take the elevator at five minutes before ten, the elevator is not working. He returns to his apartment to call Linda, but she does not answer. He assumes she shut off her phone because he would be there soon and she wanted to have no interruptions. Edmund calls the Transit Staff to file a complaint that they have ruined his life, and the woman at the Transit center says there is a spy in the elevator and it will be some time before it can be fixed because the Army thinks they may have to starve him out. Edmund is crestfallen, then realizes that there are also stairs. It is 10:15, but he rushes to the staircase to try to get to Linda. As he races down, he notices a door to the elevator shaft between the 150th and 149th floors. He pauses to contemplate it, and suddenly a man (the \u201cspy\u201d) bursts out. He threatens Edmund with a gun, forcing him to escort them both back to Edmund\u2019s 153rd floor room without alerting anyone. He does this. Edmund is forced to make him a cup of coffee, taking one of his two coffee rations for the day. Edmund fears that the spy is a maniac, and does as he asks while they wait for the Army to lose the trail so the spy will leave. The spy reveals to Edmund that he is actually an atomic engineer testing his theory that it is now safe for humans to go outside the Projects by risking his life since the Commission would not let him run experiments on it. Edmund is stunned since this is contrary to what he has been conditioned to believe. \n"

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet.

A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape\nreality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.\n   \n \n \n  A BOTTLE OF\n   \n \n   Old Wine\n   \n \n \n  By Richard O.

        "Summary_1": "Korvin sits in a cell after crash-landing on the planet of the Tr'en, which is populated by an extremely logical and intelligent humanoid race. Due to the speed of their scientific and technological advancements, the Comity of Planets will soon extend them an invitation, but Korvin believes they will not accept their offer. As a representative of Earth Central, he has been sent to Tr'en in order to find a way to prevent its people from marauding and settling other planets. In the days since Korvin's crash, the prison guards provide him with food and teach him the local language through drug hypnosis. He describes the language as \"stiff and slightly awkward\" but acknowledges its logical, meticulous construction. After several days imprisoned, a Tr'en named Didyak visits Korvin and informs him that he will be brought to The Ruler. When Korvin meets The Ruler--a massive, formidable Tr'en--he answers his questions to the best of his ability with respect to the logical constructions of the language. Korvin describes the physical appearance of adult humans as well as children, and The Ruler appears confused by the variations in height. The Ruler keeps emphasizing the importance of speaking with exactitude when communicating with the Tr'en. When Korvin claims his purpose on the planet was to crash-land his ship, The Ruler scoffs and orders him connected to a lie-detector machine for the duration of the questioning. After adjusting the lie-detector machine to Korvin's physiology, The Ruler continues his interrogation of Korvin, attempting to determine the true purpose of his mission on Tr'en. Adopting the Tr'en mode of providing extremely logical answers, Korvin claims his mission is to \"stay alive\", which frustrates The Ruler; he claims Korvin is trying to confuse him, so he calls upon his experts to help determine if the machine is faulty and analyze Korvin's responses. As the Tr'en broach the subject of Earth, they start to ask questions about its name, location, and finally, governance. Because the Tr'en receive and obey orders from one Ruler, they are completely perplexed by the concept of democracy where conflicting interests may contribute to a system of self-governance. In fact, they are so stumped by Korvin's responses that they continue this line of questioning for three days and are unsatisfied by what they consider to be his illogical, but truthful answers. On the third day, Korvin takes advantage of their lack of mental insight to escape prison and sends a message back to Earth Central informing them that he has accomplished his mission because the Tr'en will never be able to solve the problem of democracy.",
        "Summary_2": "Korvin, a human, had been siting isolated in a jail cell for three days on the Tr'en planet when Didyak, a member of the Tr'en, entered his cell. The Tr'en are somewhat humanoid, greenish beings, and Didyak was tall. Korvin had learned some of the Tr'en language under drug hypnosis but was frustrated with how literally Didyak took everything, so it took some time to determine that The Ruler had summoned Korvin for a conversation. This was what he wanted, though: Korvin had been sent to eliminate the threat the the Tr'en posed to the Comity of Planets and the rest of the galaxy because of how quickly their technology was developing. When he got to the Room of the Ruler, Korvin met The Ruler who was over seven feet tall, which was tall even for the Tr'en. The Ruler started with questions about how typical of a human Korvin was, and Korvin found himself apologizing for his race's inclination towards approximation over precision. They don't believe Korvin when he says that his job required he be on this planet, and the Tr'en brought out a lie detector that they built. Korvin was worried about the calibration of the machine, because he knew one misstep would mean death. After the machine was calibrated, the questioning continued, and the Tr'en had to accept that Korvin crashed his ship on purpose. Korvin's truth was not the truth that the Tr'en wanted, which Korvin used against the logic-led race. Experts in logic were called into the room, and Korvin quickly learned that logical paradoxes would not trick the Tr'en. He gave them just enough information for them to logically conclude, incorrectly, that Korvin was there to get help invading Earth. They discussed their respective forms of government, and when The Ruler asked who is in charge on Earth, Korvin refused to give away that information. This causes frustration, and the seed of confusion had been planted. Korvin asked them about their government, which has one being ruling everyone else. Korvin tried to explain that there is no one governor, and that everyone governs, which made no sense to the Tr'en. They did not understand how there was not a single ruler to make decisions; democracy seemed impossible to them. One of the experts insisted that Korvin was lying and that something must be wrong with the machine; they took a three-day break from questioning to investigate the issue only to conclude that nothing was wrong. On this third day, Korvin escaped. He knew the Tr'en couldn't conclude that it was an impossible problem, so their subconsciouses would prepare Korvin for an escape so that their conscious selves wouldn't have to admit that they did not have the answer. The story ends with Korvin heading back to Earth, sending a report back that the Tr'en would have to change their social structure to get the insight to answer the questions he left them with, meaning they were no longer a threat.",
        "Summary_3": "Korvin, a visitor from Earth, is held captive on a planet run by a race called the Tr'en. The Tr'en rely on logic and exact measurements to design their systems of governance, but Korvin's homeworld does not do quite the same. When the ruler of this world begins to question Korvin, they doubt he is telling the truth when he talks about how he crashed his ship on their planet on purpose. They wheel out a lie detector in order to tell if Korvin is telling the truth. The lie detector affirms his answers, but when Korvin starts to speak about his home world's politics, it is too much for the Tr'en to stand and one of his guards sets him free because they cannot cope with what they perceive as logical fallacies in the governance of Korvin's homeworld.",
        "Summary_4": "Korvin is a man from Earth who has landed on the planet of the Tr\u2019en. At the beginning of the story, he has been imprisoned in a jail cell and isolated for three days, causing him great boredom. Every night, he is hypnotized so his guards can teach him the Tr\u2019en language. Korvin has learned that the Tr\u2019en are literalists. After three days, a Tr\u2019en named Didyak comes to Korvin\u2019s cell and tells him the Ruler wants to speak with him. Korvin follows the rituals of the Tr\u2019en language and social norms, agreeing to see the Ruler. After all, Korvin\u2019s purpose is to remove the Tr\u2019en threat.\n\tThe Ruler asks Korvin several questions about his race, name, and sex and if his appearance is typical for a human. When Korvin offers a wide range of heights for humans, including \u201capproximately nine or ten inches,\u201d referring to children, the Ruler snaps at him that they ask for precision because the Tr\u2019en are scientific men. \n\tAs the Ruler asks him questions, Korvin answers truthfully but in ways that will not translate literally, thus confusing the Ruler. He has his people bring in a truth detector machine and hook it up to Korvin, testing it with a set of questions to which Korvin answers truthfully and ordering him to answer one untruthfully. These responses lead the Ruler to accept that the machine is calibrated accurately. The Ruler then returns to questioning Korvin, asking if he intentionally crashed his ship on their planet and what else his job entails after landing. Korvin says his job also involves staying alive, and the Ruler retorts that that is not the truth they want. \n\tKorvin has discerned that the Tr\u2019en are brilliant with math and physical science but know nothing about how the mind works. The Ruler calls in his experts for advice who explain to Korvin that they will not be confused by logical paradox. They tell Korvin his plan to confuse them is a failure, and Korvin says that is good. The experts conclude that Korvin must be a traitor to Earth and must want them to conquer it. When the Ruler asks Korvin an either/or question, Korvin answers, \u201cBoth,\u201d remaining intentionally ambiguous. When the Ruler asks about the government on Earth, Korvin answers that he cannot give him the explanation, but when he is pressed, Korvin pretends to try to be helpful, all the while, following through with his plan to confuse the Tr\u2019en by describing a democracy with everyone as the governor and no single ruler.\n\tAfter the experts decide their machine must be faulty, they put Korvin back in his cell but continue questioning him. He escapes after someone leaves a door unlocked and a weapon nearby. As he leaves the planet, he sends a message ahead that the Tr\u2019en are worrying over the meaning of democracy and will not be a threat because they will be so focused on the conundrum that they can\u2019t understand. \n"

        "Query": "What is the role of The Ruler in the story \"Lost in Translation\" and who does he govern?",
        "Article": "The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\nreceiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\nstanding or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\nthe training.\n  \n \n  He hoped they were right.\n  \n \n  The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\nwasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\nshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\nship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\n   \n   ended\n   \n  , nor did it\nmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But it is not\u2014not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\nlogic\"\u2014the Tr'en word seemed to mean\n   \n   right-saying\n   \n  \u2014\"who will advise\nthe Ruler. They will be called.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\nthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\ngestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n  \n \n  The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\nus,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"\u2014\n   \n   chulad-like\n   \n  Korvin\ntranslated\u2014\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin devoutly hoped so.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

When he had\nfinished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet.\nHe stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his\ncigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n  \n \n  \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said.\n  \n \n  The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\"\nhe said abruptly.\n  \n \n  Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"A long time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why do you say that?\"\n  \n \n  \"When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort.

Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\nwalls were dark-brown, the furnishings\u2014a single great chair, several\nkneeling-benches and a small table near the chair\u2014were light-brown,\nof some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\nKorvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\ncontrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n  \n \n  The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\nbroad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\ntable near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\neither side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\nsix and a half feet high.\n  \n \n  Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\nHe wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\nThe Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex\u2014if\nany\u2014and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n  \n \n  Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\nam,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n  \n \n  \"Within what limits?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\nunder four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\ndidn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\nwere at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\nwent on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\nusually less than that\u2014approximately nine or ten inches. We call\nthese\n   \n   children\n   \n  ,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n  \n \n  \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\nsaid. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\nsaid apologetically.\n  \n \n  \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n  \n \n  \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\nfor you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\npaused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\nwent on. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\nprove that beyond any doubt.\"\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\nhave tests for such matters?\"\n  \n \n  \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\nmachine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\nIt will be attached to you.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\ntechnicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\ndials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\nstraps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector\u2014and Korvin felt\nhimself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\nmatch their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\nhypnop\u00e6dic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\nwonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\nnecessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\nThe Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\naddition to the Comity of Nations.\n  \n \n  Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\nKorvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n  \n \n  He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\nhim telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\njob\u2014not to mention the strongest personal inclinations\u2014demanded most\nstrongly that he stay alive.\n  \n \n  He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\nseat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\nelastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\nscrews, he made no resistance.\n  \n \n  \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n  \n \n  \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Are you a\n   \n   chulad\n   \n  ?\" the Ruler asked. A\n   \n   chulad\n   \n  was a small native\npet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\nbeetle.\n  \n \n  \"I am not,\" he said.\n  \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When his\nship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been\nstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\nInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how\nwe operate?\"\n  \n \n  He told her the tales he'd heard.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Ruler is the sole governor of the Tr'en race. Characterized by their humanoid appearance, Tr'en are tall, greenish, and have four fingers. The Ruler himself is taller than most at seven-feet tall and is quite broad. The Tr'en are very logical and speak in a language almost mathematical in its clarity and precision. The Ruler epitomizes Tr'en commitment to logical inquiry. At first, The Ruler grills Korvin on his name, his race, his sex, and whether or not his appearance is normal for humanity. When Korvin's response regarding the variations in height amongst human adults and children, The Ruler is confounded. He also disbelieves Korvin's response regarding his purpose on Tr'en. Because of this, The Ruler orders Korvin to be hooked up to a lie detector. After adjusting the detector to Korvin's physiology, Korvin launches into a line of questioning regarding planet Earth, specifically the governance of it. When the experts monitoring the lie detector's reactions to Korvin's answers become baffled by his truth-telling in the face of seemingly illogical answers, The Ruler seemingly throws in the towel and lets the experts investigate the idea that Korvin is either lying or the machine is broken. In reality, Korvin has exploited a flaw in their logic--although they are masters of science, they have not mastered mental science. Only a grasp of mental science would allow the Tr'en to fathom humankind's embrace of democracy.",
        "Summary_2": "The Ruler is the head of the Tr'en government, and is a greenish humanoid who stands over seven feet tall. He makes all of the decisions for the race, and was appointed by the prior Ruler, which he feels is an important aspect of the consistency of the Tr'en leadership. The Ruler is the one who leads the interrogation of Korvin three days after his initial capture, and calls in the logic experts and the lie detector machine when he finds he needs assistance to understand what information Korvin is giving them. He is important to Korvin's plan: his goal after being captured is to talk to The Ruler, to plant some confusion in his head along with the logic experts. Korvin thinks that describing democracy to a society that is so single-authority oriented will force them to restructure their government if they want to try to understand the truths that Korvin presents them about Earth and related governments. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Ruler is the ruler of this planet. Anything the Ruler commands is done, without question. The Tr'en people rely on this type of governance as no other form of governance makes much sense to them. Someone must be in charge of shaping and then enforcing the rules. That is the Ruler's role, and in this story, he is taxed with questioning the prisoner Korvin in order to get to the bottom of his purpose for being on their planet. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Ruler is the autocratic leader of the Tr\u2019en. He is a large creature, more than seven feet tall and with a broad build. He has been trained by the previous Ruler, who was trained by the Ruler before him, and so on for past generations, ensuring that the society and its values do not change. The Ruler questions Korvin, trying to determine Korvin\u2019s ulterior motive for crash-landing his ship on the planet. Captives in his presence are closely guarded. The Ruler demands precision and exactitude in answers from Korvin, and when Korvin\u2019s responses are more figurative than literal, he sends for their truth-detector. As Korvin\u2019s answers remain intriguingly vague, which the Ruler cannot understand, he accuses Korvin of not telling the truth that he wants. He calls his experts for their advice, and they also question Korvin. The Ruler and his experts cannot understand Korvin\u2019s explanation of the government on Earth because his statements contradict their assumptions, especially about government. After a frustrating interrogation, the Ruler sends Korvin away but allows his experts to continue to question him in an attempt to understand what he says."

I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n  \n \n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n  \n \n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n  \n \n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cansin\n   \n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n  \n \n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n  \n \n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n  \n \n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Selak\n   \n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n  \n \n  I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised.

Through the portal I could see the\nsuited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray\nprojectors.\n  \n \n  \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and\nshook his head disapprovingly.\n  \n \n  \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can\ntake apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we\ncomplete the survey.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of\nwhat it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a\nspaceship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if\n   \n   too\n   \n  many parts are missing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,\nwhy don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n  \n \n  Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned\ncautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,\nand this isn't the way.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself.

        "Summary_1": "After Korvin crash-lands on Tr\u2019en, he is captured and imprisoned for several days before he wakes up. During that time, the prison guards teach him the Tr\u2019en language via hypnop\u00e6dic language instruction. He learns the language is closer to mathematical metalanguage and is centered in logic and clarity. As a result, Korvin has to adjust the way he speaks in order to make sure to convey what he really means in his conversations with Didyak and when he responds to The Ruler's line of questioning. Because the Tr'en language requires perfect logic, Korvin's answers to The Ruler's questions confuse The Ruler and his group of experts that examine the lie detector and confer to determine if Korvin is telling the truth or beating the system somehow. Translation ultimately saves Korvin since the Tr'en are unable to logically process the concept of democracy, and they will spend an endless amount of time trying to solve that problem instead of advancing to the point where they will maraud and settle others in the Comity of Planets.",
        "Summary_2": "Translation is at the core of the story because Korvin has to rely on the logical nature of the Tr'en language to try to throw the Tr'en people off. Because of the lived experiences of the Tr'en people, with their specific government style, and their literal approach to communication, Korvin is able to give them enough information about why he is there to be telling the truth without giving away his true motives. He hopes that this will spur them to try democracy in an attempt to understand the nature of the government on Earth, which will break their current habits and hopefully slow down their technological progress. It is the way that the groups of people must translate as they communicate that allows Korvin to confuse the masters of logic in the end. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Tr'en language has words that have more exact meanings than words in the English language. As a result, the true intent of the speaker is better conveyed. Korvin learns the Tr'en language while he is their captive, and he picks up on the nuance so well that he can understand the exact meaning and intent of the Tr'en when they speak to them, and thus use this to his advantage. Korvin can mask his own intent since his own language, the language of Earth, is less literal and capable of more complexity.",
        "Summary_4": "   The Tr\u2019en society is based on straightforward communication and literal interpretation of every spoken word. This is presumably why they teach Korvin their language, enabling him to communicate with them directly without an interpreter. However, the Tr\u2019ens\u2019 exclusive focus on math and the physical sciences creates a significant weakness that Korvin exploits: they have no understanding of their own or others\u2019 mental capacity and nuances of language and, therefore, no ability to interpret anything they consider illogical. When Didyak uses the word \u201ctalk\u201d that means to \u201cgain information from, by peaceful and vocal means,\u201d Korvin realizes that he will be able to save himself and his mission by communicating with the Tr\u2019ens in a way that literally answers their questions without giving away his true mission of stopping the Tr\u2019en\u2019s advancement into the galaxy. \n     When the Ruler tries to find out Korvin\u2019s purpose for intentionally crashing his ship and if he has other intentions, Korvin\u2019s responses are forthright in a literal sense: yes, he crashed his ship on purpose, no his job isn\u2019t ended, now his job is to stay alive.       \n     Completely flummoxed, the Ruler calls in his experts in logic to question Korvin further, and based on his answers, they logically conclude that he is a traitor to Earth and is there to help the Tr\u2019ens overthrow Earth. Korvin also confuses the Tr\u2019ens with his explanation of Earth\u2019s democracy. Their frustration ends the hearing before the Ruler, but the experts continue to question Korvin in his cell. \n     It becomes clear to the experts that their lie-detecting machine is not faulty, but they cannot understand Korvin\u2019s explanations. So on the third day after being called to the Ruler, Korvin finds an unlocked door and a weapon, enabling him to escape and thus solving their insolvable problem. Korvin knows that the Tr\u2019en will be obsessed with trying to understand the democratic ideas that he described and that they will never be able to understand them without changing themselves. They are incapable of translating his responses in the context of their very literal society.\n"

        "Article": "A fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n  \n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n  \n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n  \n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n  \n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n  \n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n  \n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n  \n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n  \n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n  \n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n  \n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n  \n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto.

I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman.

Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n  \n \n  \"So far. Keep talking.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dear Editor:\n  \n \n  These guys might be queer drunk hopheads. But if not? If soon brain\ndissolve, body fall apart, how long have we got? Please, anybody who\nknows answer, write to me\u2014Ivan Smernda, Plaza Ritz Arms\u2014how long is a\ngleeb?\n  \n \n<doc-sep>When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n  \n \n  I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n  \n \n  Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n  \n \n  \"Awake, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n  \n \n  \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n  \n \n  I grunted my disgust.\n  \n \n  \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n  \n \n  \"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n  \n \n  \"What remark?\"\n  \n \n  \"It said, '\n   \n   My\n   \n  masters will be displeased with\n   \n   me\n   \n  if you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.'

        "Summary_1": "Didyak is a Tr'en from the planet Tr'en, and he is tall, slightly green, vaguely humanoid, and has cat-like pupils. Didyak is the first Tr'en that Korvin encounters after waking up in the days following his crash. Having been educated in the Tr'en language through hypnosis, Korvin is able to communicate with Didyak, and he does so, making sure to address with the utmost respect according to Tr'en customs. Didyak carries a small weapon that is translucent and looks like a pistol; he also carries a small knife attached to his belt. Didyak's speech is stiff and slightly awkward, much like the rest of the Tr'en, and he speaks with very careful attention paid to the construction of each sentence in order to express perfect logic. Like the other Tr'en, Didyak also has fifty-eight pointy teeth, at which Korvin tries not to stare. The Ruler has sent Didyak to bring Korvin for an audience with him so that he may learn more about Earth.",
        "Summary_2": "Didyak is the member of the Tr'en race who came to retrieve Korvin from his cell when The Ruler summoned Korvin for questioning. Didyak is the first Tr'en who Korvin had a conversation with after having learned the Tr'en language under drug hypnosis, which gave him practice in the customs of conversation and the logical, literal nature of the Tr'en discourse. Didyak is also the first experience the reader has with this language, and learns more about the knowledge Korvin comes into his mission with through this exchange.",
        "Summary_3": "Didyak is the Tr'en who arrives at Korvin's cell in order to take him to the Ruler. Didyak is the first being with which Korvin has had any interaction in a long time, so Korvin is happy to talk with Didyak and to work on using the correct Tr'en words to convey his exact meaning. Didyak answers Korvin's questions in a very literal sense, which is customary among the Tr'en people. Didyak explains that he must take Korvin to the Ruler and that the Ruler is going to question him in a way that is meant to gather information.",
        "Summary_4": "Didyak is a tall, green Tr\u2019en who, like all Tr\u2019en, looks somewhat humanoid. He comes to Korvin\u2019s cell after Korvin has been held in solitary confinement for three days. His initial conversation with Korvin follows the Tr\u2019en ritual in which Didyak says who Korvin is and Korvin says who Didyak is (\u201cof the Tr\u2019en\u201d). Didyak seems to be a guard because he has access to Korvin and enters his cell; he also carries a small translucent pistol-like weapon along with a knife in a sheath. After introducing each other, Didyak waits for Korvin to speak, and when he does, he asks what Didyak wants with him; Didyak answers that he wants nothing with Korvin. This response reminds Korvin of what he has learned of the Tr\u2019en; they are extremely literal, more inclined to mathematical and scientific thinking. And when Korvin asks what Didyak is doing there, he again answers literally, stating that he is leaning against the door. When Korvin finally asks a specific question that can only be answered literally, Didyak beams at him as if he is pleased that Korvin finally understands what he needs to say. Didyak tells him that he has been ordered to take Korvin to the Ruler, who wants to talk with him. Didyak escorts Korvin to the Ruler, but his interaction with Korvin has proven a stark reminder of how the Tr\u2019ens think and that Korvin needs to be mindful of how he speaks to them. The interaction with Didyak also gives Korvin his plan for how he will thwart the Tr\u2019ens\u2019 anticipated expansion to other planets.\n"

        "Query": "What is the environment like on the planet Tr'en in the story \"Lost in Translation\"?",
        "Article": " \n \n  LOST\n   \n  IN\n   \n  TRANSLATION\n  \n \n  By\n  \n \n  LARRY M.\n   \n  HARRIS\n  \n \n \n \n \n   In language translation, you may get a literally accurate\nword-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in\nspace-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n \n \n  The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had\never been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the\nTr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed\non that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made\nKorvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and\nwere on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be\nsettling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars.\nFaster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently\nefficient physical scientists of the Tr'en\u2014and that would mean, in\nthe ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of\nPlanets.\n  \n \n  An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\n  \n \n  Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which\nwas hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of\nisolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own\nmind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was\nno good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't\nunlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the\nprobability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat\nsmelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by\nmagic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship,\nto the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\n  \n \n  He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly\nthat the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or\neven a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to\nall the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd\nhave been better than nothing.\n  \n \n  In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there\nwould at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en\nKorvin was all alone.\n  \n \n  True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated\nlesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure\nout of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to\ndiscuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was\nnobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared\nat the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any\nimperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\n  \n \n  He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a\nfull stock of food concentrates.\n  \n \n  But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to\nanyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\n  \n \n  As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got\nup off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\n  \n \n  He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid\u2014that is, if you\ndon't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to\nbe rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't\nknow why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories,\nbut none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin\nreally didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are\nKorvin,\" he said.\n  \n \n  It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he\nreplied. The green being nodded.\n  \n \n  \"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed\nslightly\u2014but no more than slightly\u2014and came into the cell, closing\nthe door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided\nquickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that\nhis captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small\ntranslucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a\nsmall knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but\nthere might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech\u2014apparently\nthere was only one language on the planet\u2014was stiff and slightly\nawkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the\nmost rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come\nacross. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd\ndealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and\ncarefully constructed than even those marvels.\n  \n \n  \"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the\ndoor-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As\nconversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better\nthan solitude.\n  \n \n  \"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist\napproach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard\nto get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a\nsecond.\n  \n \n  \"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\n  \n \n  Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving\nas it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly\npointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come\nto you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  It wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language,\nand Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information\nfrom, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future\nreference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are\nto go to him. Such is his command.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the\ncommand of the Ruler,\" he said\u2014another ritual. Everybody obeyed the\ncommand of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to\ntry.\n  \n \n  But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the\ncommands of the Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014and remove the Tr'en threat from\nthe rest of the galaxy forever.\n  \n \n  That, after all, was his job.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\n  \n \n  The aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\n   \n   And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto.

There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Verana snapped her fingers. \"So that's why the aliens read Marie's\nmind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!\"\n  \n \n  Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.\n\"Where are you?\n   \n   Who\n   \n  are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I control the ship.\" Although the voice spoke without stilted\nphrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.\n  \n \n  \"What are your\u2014your masters going to do with us?\" Marie asked\nanxiously.\n  \n \n  \"You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine\nyou. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like\nwhen it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n  \n \n  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n<doc-sep>The trip to Venus came off without a hitch. I did a lot of thinking on\nthat trip. I thought about Mars and the revolt there. And I thought\nabout Colonel Leonard Walsh and how he was supposed to be quelling that\nrevolt. Ever since Walsh had taken command, ever since he'd started\npushing the natives around, there'd been trouble. It was almost as if\nthe whole damned planet had blown up in our faces the moment he took\nover. Swell guy, Walsh.\n  \n \n  Venus was hotter than I'd expected it to be. Much too hot for the tunic\nI was wearing. It smelled, too. A funny smell I couldn't place. Like\na mixture of old shoe and after-shave. There were plants everywhere\nI looked. Big plants and small ones, some blooming with flowers I'd\nnever seen before, and some as bare as cactus.\n  \n \n  I recognized a blue figure as one of the natives the pilot had told me\nabout. He was tall, looking almost human except that everything about\nhim was elongated. His features, his muscles, everything seemed to have\nbeen stretched like a rubber band. I kept expecting him to pop back to\nnormal. Instead, he flashed a double row of brilliant teeth at me.\n  \n \n  I wondered if he spoke English. \"Hey, boy,\" I called.\n  \n \n  He ambled over with long-legged strides that closed the distance\nbetween us in seconds.\n  \n \n  \"Call me Joe,\" he said.\n  \n \n  I dropped my bags and stared at him. Maybe this\n   \n   was\n   \n  going to be a\nsimple assignment after all. \"I sure am glad to see you, Joe,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"Same here, Toots,\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"The guys back in Space II are searching high and low for you,\" I told\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"You've got the wrong number,\" he said, and I was a little surprised at\nhis use of Terran idiom.\n  \n \n  \"You are Joe, aren't you? Joe the trader?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Joe, all right,\" he said. \"Only thing I ever traded, though, was a\npocketknife. Got a set of keys for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" I said, my voice conveying my disappointment. I sighed and began\nwondering just how I should go about contacting the Joe I was looking\nfor. My orders said I was to report to Captain Bransten immediately\nupon arrival. I figured the hell with Captain Bransten. I outranked him\nanyway, and there wasn't much he could do if I decided to stop for a\ndrink first.\n  \n \n  \"Where's the Officer's Club?\" I asked the Venusian.\n  \n \n  \"Are you buying information or are you just curious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Can you take me there?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing, Toots.\" He picked up my bags and started walking up a\nheavily overgrown path. We'd probably walked for about ten minutes when\nhe dropped my bags and said, \"There it is.\"\n  \n \n  The Officer's Club was a plasteel hut with window shields that\nprotected it from the heat of the sun. It didn't look too comfortable\nbut I really wanted that drink. I reached into my tunic and slipped\nthe native thirty solars.\n  \n \n  He stared at the credits curiously and then shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh\nwell, you're new here. We'll let it go.\"\n  \n \n  He took off then, while I stared after him, wondering just what he'd\nmeant. Had I tipped him too little?\n  \n \n  I shrugged and looked over at the Officer's Club. From the outside it\nlooked as hot as hell.\n  \n \n  On the inside it was about two degrees short of that mark. I began to\ncurse Walsh for taking me away from my nice soft job in Space II.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much inside the club. A few tables and chairs, a dart game\nand a bar. Behind the bar a tall Venusian lounged.\n  \n \n  I walked over and asked, \"What are you serving, pal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Call me Joe,\" he answered.\n  \n \n  He caught me off balance. \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"Joe,\" he said again.\n  \n \n  A faint glimmer of understanding began to penetrate my thick skull.\n\"You wouldn't happen to be Joe the trader? The guy who knows all about\nMars, would you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I never left home,\" he said simply. \"What are you drinking?\"\n  \n \n  That rat! That dirty, filthy, stinking, unprincipled....\n  \n \n \n   But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name like\n   \n  Joe.\n   \n   Among the natives, I mean.\n   \n \n \n  Sure. Oh sure. Real simple. Walsh was about the lowest, most\ncontemptible....\n  \n \n  \"What are you drinking, pal?\" the Venusian asked again.\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said. \"How do I get to the captain's shack?\"\n  \n \n  \"Follow your nose, pal. Can't miss it.\"\n  \n \n  I started to pick up my bag as another Venusian entered. He waved at\nthe bartender.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Joe,\" he said. \"How's it going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so hot, Joe,\" the bartender replied.\n  \n \n  I listened in fascination. Joe, Joe, Joe. So this was Walsh's idea of a\ngreat gag. Very funny. Very....\n  \n \n  \"You Major Polk, sweetheart?\" the Venusian who'd just come in asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" I said, still thinking of Colonel Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"You better get your butt over to the captain's shack,\" he said. \"He's\nabout ready to post you as overdue.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" I said wearily. \"Will you take my bags, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Roger,\" he answered. He picked up the bags and nodded at the bar.\n  \n \n  \"So long, Joe,\" he said to the bartender.\n  \n \n  \"See you, Joe,\" the bartender called back.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"They don't like me bringing yer meals to you in yer cabin,\" Chip said.\n\"But the cap'n knows I'm the best cook in the Merchant Service. They\nwon't mess with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What has Mr. Tony got on the captain, Chip?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"They're in some kind o' crooked business together. You want some more\nsmoked turkey?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What have they got against my going to Jorgensen's Worlds?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dunno. Hasn't been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I\nsure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was\nyer age.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen's\nWorlds like?\"\n  \n \n  \"One of 'em's cold as hell and three of 'em's colder. Most o' the\nJorgies live on Svea; that's the least froze up. Man don't enjoy eatin'\nhis own cookin' like he does somebody else's.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's where I'm lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo's the captain got\naboard for Jorgensen's?\"\n  \n \n  \"Derned if I know. In and out o' there like a grasshopper, ever few\nweeks. Don't never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says.\nDon't know what we even run in there for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?\"\n  \n \n  \"To Alabaster. That's nine days' run in-sector from Jorgensen's. You\nain't got another one of them cigars, have you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Plenty o' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins.\" Chip puffed\nthe cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and\nbrandy.\n  \n \n  \"Them Sweaties is what I don't like,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Retief looked at him questioningly.\n  \n \n  \"You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin' devils. Skinny legs, like a\nlobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin'\nhead. You can see the pulse beatin' when they get riled.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've never had the pleasure,\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"You prob'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip\nout. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin'.\"\n  \n \n  There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor.\n  \n \n  \"I ain't superstitious ner nothin',\" Chip said. \"But I'll be\ntriple-damned if that ain't them boarding us now.\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door,\naccompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy\nknock shook the door.\n  \n \n  \"They got to look you over,\" Chip whispered. \"Nosy damn Sweaties.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unlock it, Chip.\" The chef opened the door.\n  \n \n  \"Come in, damn you,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like\nfeet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set\ncompound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees.\nBehind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien rasped.\n  \n \n  \"Who's your friend, Captain?\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind; just do like he tells you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yo' papiss,\" the alien said again.\n  \n \n  \"Okay,\" Retief said. \"I've seen it. You can take it away now.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Don't horse around,\" the captain said. \"This fellow can get mean.\"\n  \n \n  The alien brought two tiny arms out from the concealment of the mantle,\nclicked toothed pincers under Retief's nose.\n  \n \n  \"Quick, soft one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Captain, tell your friend to keep its distance. It looks brittle, and\nI'm tempted to test it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those\nsnappers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Last chance,\" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch\nfrom Retief's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Show him your papers, you damned fool,\" the captain said hoarsely. \"I\ngot no control over Skaw.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n  \n \n  He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I\nthink of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far\nhave you got in the tractors?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the\nspaceship where they belong. We\n   \n   shouldn't\n   \n  risk losing them and\ngetting stuck here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to\nmeet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and\ntastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.\nOut there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien\nlanguages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.\nUsing the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as\neasily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced\nspacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In\nthe future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing\nto death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n  \n \n  I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience\nis less painful and more efficient.\"\n  \n \n  Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you\ngot me away from those aliens.\"\n  \n \n  \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they\nwere prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men\ngot out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\nthan they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all\nthe time.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into\ndanger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we\nwere trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered\nus one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for\nus. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village\nidiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that\nfar up the intelligence scale.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n  \n \n  \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted\nsomebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens\n   \n   want\n   \n  Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog\ncame to Nagurski.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been\na blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on\n   \n   some\n   \n  worlds,\n   \n   most\n   \n  worlds, but not good on\n   \n   all\n   \n  worlds. I'm never\ngoing to be that foolhardy again.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you're losing\n   \n   confidence\n   \n  , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any\nmore. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n  \n \n  \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n  \n \n  \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting\nExecutive Officer.\"\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!\nI'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n  \n \n  \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken\nin rank now and then.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how\nto stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n  \n \n  I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and\nI could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of\nexperience aboard.\n  \n \n  \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him\non the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\"\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Korvin works for Earth Central and flies to the planet Tr'en on its behalf. Tr'en is a planet populated by the Tr'en race, a tall humanoid people with greenish skin, fifty-eight pointy teeth, and a unique language centered on the idea of logic. They are an extremely advanced race in terms of science and technology and others in the Comity of Planets consider them a possible threat seeing as they are in the atomic era and are on the brink of developing space travel. After Korvin crash-lands on Tr'en he sits in a prison cell noted for its smelly air, and, more importantly, its efficiency of design. Besides the Tr'en, the only known living creature on Tr'en is the chulad, a small creature that looks like a large deathwatch beetle. The Room of the Ruler is large and square, and everything inside the room is brown including the walls, furniture, and drapes. In terms of furniture, Korvin observes a large chair where The Ruler sits, many kneeling benches, and a small table near the chair. When two technicians bring in a lie detector test for Korvin, he notices that it is large, squat, and metallic and has wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes, wires, and a seat with armrests and straps. The technicians use these straps to tie Korvin into the machine.",
        "Summary_2": "This story takes place on a planet occupied by the Tr'en, a race of tall greenish humanoid-like aliens. This race is known for their extremely efficient technological development, which is attributed at least in part to their government structure. To humans, the air on the planet is a little bit smelly, and they don't expect the Tr'en to have large cultural institutions and interesting works of art because they are led by logic and mathematics alone--they even communicate very literally, talking their way through logic puzzles. There are two rooms that house most of the story: the lone jail cell that Korvin is kept in for six days in total, and the Room of the Ruler where the questioning happens. The jail cell was built very quickly once Korvin was captured, and there are no other prisoners in the jail, so it is a lonely and quiet place for Korvin to sit in, with nothing to occupy him but his own thoughts. There is one bed for him to lie on but nothing else of interest. His only interaction with others is the nightly lessons in the Tr'en language that are done under drug hypnosis. He is escorted out of this solitary confinement to meet The Ruler, whose chambers are a large room with brown and tan everywhere. The walls were dark brown, many of the furnishings were light brown, and the drapes on the windows were tan. Although the brown contrasted nicely with the green skin of the Tr'en, Korvin still found there to be far too much brown in the room. There was a great big chair in the middle for The Ruler to sit in, surrounded by benches for others to kneel at. Eventually, a lie detector chair is brought into the room as well. The story ends with Korvin making it back to his spaceship, but the author does not give us many details about this part of the setting. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on a planet that is ruled by a people called the Tr'en. The planet is not as far along in its evolution as Korvin's planet, and Korvin makes a point of this several times in his observations about their lack of experience with other races and in their absence from the Comity of Planets, a governing body that oversees many different planets. The Tr'en are efficient, so all the structures built on the planet are built without flaw. There also isn't anything very exciting to do recreationally on the planet. The planet and its people are largely defined by the very logical and literal nature of the Tr'en.",
        "Summary_4": "\n\tThe story takes place on the planet occupied by the Tr\u2019en, an oxygen-breathing humanoid species whose members tend to be quite tall and various shades of green. The Tr\u2019en are known to be an especially efficient lot who are mathematically and scientifically minded, and therefore literally minded as well. Word has reached Earth that the Tr\u2019en are making progress in their atomic era and are almost capable of space travel, which means they will soon settle other planets and travel to nearby stars. It is also suspected they will soon be capable of traveling faster than light, which will earn them an invitation to join the Comity of Planets and which they are sure to reject. The Tr\u2019en have a justice system in place; they have jail cells and the advanced technology that enabled them to build a truth detector device. The planet is ruled by an autocrat referred to as the Ruler; everyone obeys him because they know there are no second chances. This form of government ensures uniformity, enabling rapid, consistent responses from everyone. Everything is constant, as each successive Ruler is adopted by the current Ruler, guaranteeing the same wisdom and judgment exist under each leader.\n"

He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling\ninto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape.

        "Summary_1": "Jonathan Fawkes dropped off the only member of his crew on Mars after he got space sickness, so he was alone on the journey to Jupiter. He had been charged with dropping off tobacco seed to see if they could cultivate it on the colonies in Jupiter. However, along the way, he got tired at the wheel of the ship, and, during his nap, crashed into an asteroid. When he awoke, a beautiful blonde woman named Ann was standing over him. They introduce themselves, and she explains that she\u2019s one of the 27 female survivors of their crash over three years ago. Ann sees a horde of centaurs coming over the plains, so she and Jonathan crawl to the foothills, where they can\u2019t be followed. She spears a creature along the way and hooks it on her belt. Jonathan attempts to escape, as he\u2019s uncomfortable around women and wants a cigarette, but she takes him down. They run into nine more women who pin him to the ground. They start to carry him the four miles back to their base, but he asks to walk instead as he\u2019s humiliated. They trudge through the foothills, only stopping once to throw stones at the pestering centaurs, before finally reaching home. They treat Jonathan like a king, pulling out a chair for him at the table, and endlessly complimenting him. They eat inside the dining room of their wrecked ship, and Jonathan watches the wild, Amazonian-like women in horror. Their leader, a big woman named Billy, halts all the flirting and tells Jonathan that he needs to rest in order to feel better. After his belly\u2019s full, he quickly falls asleep, and they carry him upstairs to bed, attempting to take off his shoes which he refuses. \nThe next morning, he wakes up and walks outside with a cane, exaggerating his injuries so as to be treated better. He sits beneath a tree and is soon greeted by Ann. She grabs him and they make to embrace but are caught by the rest of the girls. Billy splits them up and says it\u2019s time to figure out who gets him. The women fight and argue their cases, and Jonathan slips away, running back to his ship. Another cruiser is sat down next to his own, the Interstellar Cosmography Society scrawled on its side. He meets Dr. Boynton and another man who offer to rescue him. Jonathan refuses them, tells them there\u2019s nothing to worry about, then grabs his tobacco seeds, cigarettes, and tools, and makes his way back to the women. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Jonathan Fawkes, a Universal space pilot, flying from Mars to Jupiter, has seeds for the colonists there. He is flying alone, using autopilot at times to sleep. Something goes wrong, and his ship crashes onto an asteroid. He is discovered by a beautiful young woman checking to see if he is alive. She reveals that she, along with 26 other women, crashed their ship onto the asteroid three years ago when they were on their way to become wives for the colonists on Jupiter. This woman, Ann Clotilde, invites Jonathan back to their camp. Along the way, she spies a herd of centaurs and hides Jonathan from them. Ann is surprisingly strong and can kill a rabbit-like creature with her spear, reminding Jonathan of an amazon. \n\tWhen Jonathan craves a cigarette and realizes they are in his ship, he turns to go back for them, but Ann stops him with the tip of her spear. Other women appear to find out what is going on, and they are all astonished to discover a man among them. They shout with joy and throw themselves at him. To prevent him from trying to get away again, they tie his hands and feet and carry him, which utterly humiliates Jonathan. He had always considered himself a tough guy, but he had been bested by a group of women! He persuades them to let him walk the rest of the way, but later, when his feet slip on the narrow ridge of a trail, they have to rescue him and then tie a rope around his waist like a child to keep him safe.\n\tAs they reach their camp, the women announce they\u2019ve caught a man, and one of the women exclaims they are rescued. But another points out that having a man there is the next best thing, and the women talk openly about his attractiveness. At dinner, several women invite Jonathan to join them for private activities the next day. He eventually falls asleep at the dinner table and is carried away to bed.\n\tThe next day, Ann, his finder, discovers him alone and engages with him. He is worried that others might see them, but she assures him they are alone. But something he says draws all of the women into the opening where they are, and they begin arguing over whose man he is, Ann\u2019s, all of theirs to share\u2026.Jonathan exclaims he should have a say in it, but Billy, the leader, tells him he doesn\u2019t. He then decides it\u2019s a good time to get those cigarettes, and when he arrives, two men are there from the Instellar Cosmography Society and offer him a ride back to civilization. Jonathan tells them he has decided he likes it there and wants to stay, even though it will be another three years before the asteroid\u2019s orbit is in the space lanes again where he can be picked up.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Jonathan Fawkes is a space pilot with a company called Universal. After dropping his co-pilot off on Mars due to illness, Jonathan has been flying solo, carrying a load of seed to be delivered to colonists on Jupiter. Somehow, he crash-lands on an asteroid, and when he wakes up, he sees a woman with bright yellow hair standing over him. Her name is Ann Clotilde, and she is one of the women that had been sent to Jupiter three years earlier by the Food-growers Association to become wives for the colonists. Ann informs Jonathan their ship had crash-landed and only twenty-seven women survived. She offers to bring Jonathan back to her camp, and Jonathan agrees despite his discomfort around women. They begin to move across the prairie. Along the way, a group of centaurs chases them, and they run toward the safety of a small ravine leading into the hills. After Ann uses her spear to snag a rabbit, Jonathan realizes the women must have developed Amazon-like skills during their time on the asteroid. He begins to crave a cigarette and decides to return to his ship to fetch the cartons of cigarettes he had left behind. Ann insists he leaves the cigarettes behind and accompanies her to the camp, whereupon he trips her and takes her spear. The commotion draws the attention of some of Ann's fellow survivors who come to her aid and apprehend Jonathan. Feeling shame, Jonathan joins the cohort on their march back to the camp as the women and the centaurs throw rocks and insults at each other. The women, particularly Olga and Ann, begin flirting with Jonathan since they haven't seen a man in many years. When they return to camp, all of the women are delighted to see a man, and he joins them for a great feast prepared by their cook, Billy. The women argue about who will get to spend alone time with Jonathan, but he is too tired to play along. Eventually, he falls asleep, and the women carry him to bed. When he awakens, he explores the encampment and runs into Ann. Emboldened by Ann's forwardness, Jonathan wraps his arm around her, and the other women suddenly appear, prepared to fight for Jonathan. As they argue amongst themselves, Jonathan makes a run for his ship, leaving the women behind. When he arrives, he sees a space cruiser next to his wrecked ship with the inscription \"Interstellar Cosmography Society.\" Three men step out, and the eldest explains to Jonathan that they have been commissioned to examine the asteroid. They offer Jonathan a ride off the asteroid, but Jonathan turns down their off. He has decided to stay with the women after all. He grabs his cigarettes and makes his way back to camp.",
        "Summary_4": "In 3372, Jonathan Fawkes, a space pilot with Universal, crash lands during a transport run from Mars to Jupiter to deliver seed for the colonists. He awakes to find a woman (Ann Clotilde) wearing a ragged blue frock and sandals that is surprised he isn\u2019t dead. She doesn\u2019t know where they are, but suspects they are on an asteroid. She and 26 other women survived a crash landing here three years ago while on their way to become wives to Jupiter\u2019s colonists. A herd of Centaurs charge towards them and they flee down a ravine that opens into a large gorge. Ann spears a small furry creature and ties it to her belt. Jonathan craves cigarettes and wants to go back to his wrecked ship to retrieve some, but Ann insists they go to camp. Jonathan knocks her feet out and takes her spear, turning it on her. Just then, another woman approaches, shrieking at the presence of a man. Jonathan flees, and nine women chase him down, bind his arms and legs, and begin carrying him to their camp. Jonathan begs to walk and they let him down, knowing they can catch him again if he tries to run. He slips and nearly plummets down a canyon wall, but Ann grabs him and saves him, humiliating Jonathan to be helped by a woman. They stop briefly to throw rocks and yell at some Centaurs on the prairie below. At their camp, they feed Jonathan in the dining salon of their wrecked ship. Some women invite Jonathan to hunt and forage, fawning over him. One of them, Olga, makes strong sexual advances. Billy, the leader of the women, silences the chatter and declares that Jonathan must rest. He says his ship can\u2019t be salvaged, and is so tired he falls asleep at the table. A dozen women carry him up to a stateroom for his rest.\nJonathan wakes with a limp and goes to the nearby stream. Ann makes a strong sexual advance on him, forcing him back into a seat when he tries to get up and assuring him that the other women won\u2019t return until lunch. Billy interrupts them, and the rest of the women are lined up behind her. Ann bears her spear and claims that Jonathan is hers because she found him. Jonathan runs back to his shipwreck and finds a group of three men from the Interstellar Cosmography Society examining the asteroid. Doctor Boynton says Jonathan is lucky they saw his wreck, but Jonathan insists he does not want to be rescued. They think he has gone mad. Jonathan tells them to send a freighter back to the asteroid in three years when it crosses into the shipping lane again to pick up his load of tobacco. He grabs tools, tobacco seeds and cigarettes, and heads back to the women\u2019s camp."

Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Happy Castaway by Robert E. McDowell takes place during the year 3372 on an asteroid between Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid is mostly prairie and sprawling plains, but there are also foothills and steep mountains. In the mountains, there is also a mountain emitting white smoke. The centaurs, the Natives on the asteroid, live in the prairie and plains, as they are unable to successfully travel through the hills and mountains. The stranded women live beyond the mountains, where the centaurs can\u2019t reach them, and have transformed the wreckage of their ship into a livable base. There is a grand table and weighted chairs to serve food at, a kitchen supposedly where they can cook the food they\u2019ve hunted and foraged, as well as areas to sleep. \nThere are rivers that run through the asteroid teeming with fish. Ann caught a rabbit-like creature, so there are other creatures to be hunted. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in 3372 on an asteroid where a flight of girls was stranded three years earlier after their ship went down. The ship's remains are still there, and the girls use it for living quarters. The asteroid is rich with flora and fauna and a variety of landforms. It has grassy meadows, foothills, chains of mountains, a volcano, and a brook. There are ravines and hills, canyons, and valleys. There are small furry animals, much like rabbits, that the girls catch to eat and large centaurs that the girls have developed a healthy fear of. Jonathan refers to the women on the planet as amazons because they are so strong, but then he also learns that the pull of gravity is 30 times less than that of Earth, so the women can lift and carry his easily. The women are eager to be rescued but equally eager for a man\u2019s attention. They flirt with Jonathan shamelessly, each trying to gain his attention. They have established a bit of social order; it appears that Billy is their leader. She reigns in the girls when they become too competitive over Jonathan. The women wait on Jonathan hand and foot, each eager for time alone with him. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in the year 3372 on an asteroid somewhere between Mars and Jupiter. Jonathan works as a pilot for a company called Universal delivering seeds to planets like Jupiter, which has a colony and a Food-growers Association. Jonathan crash-lands in a vast prairie, which stretches a mile past the crash site to a range of jagged foothills leading up to a chain of mountains. Within this chain, Jonathan sees a puff of smoke issuing from the top of a cone-shaped peak indicating the presence of a volcano. The asteroid is home to centaurs, which appear to be hostile towards humans. When Ann and Jonathan run away from the centaurs, they escape to a small ravine leading into the hills. As they make their way through the ravine, it deepens into a canyon then further into a gorge with walls towering on either side of them. On the floor of the canyon grow yellow, fern-like plants. After the women capture Jonathan, they march him back to camp by way of a narrow ledge climbing the canyon wall which comes to rest at a high ridge overlooking the prairie. Because the asteroid has less gravity than Earth, the women are thirty times as stronger than normal. Their encampment is at the head of a deep valley beyond the canyon's ridge where a tree-flanked stream flows next to their crashed space liner. Inside the space liner is a massive dining area with a long meturilium table at its center sitting atop a green fiberon carpet. It reminds Jonathan of the \"fabulous barbarian past.\"",
        "Summary_4": "In the year 3372, humans have colonized other planets in the solar system, and there is interplanetary transport to support the colonists. Asteroids can be dangerous in the shipping lanes, as the main character, Jonathan Fawkes, finds out when he crashes into one on his way to deliver seeds and other supplies to Jupiter.\nThe asteroid contains prairies, jagged foothills, a chain of mountains, a fuming volcano and deep valley gorges and streams. Dangerous Centaurs that are half man and half horse roam the prairie in herds. There is a ravine nearby to Jonathan\u2019s crash site that opens into a wide gorge with high walls that tower on both sides. Yellow fern-like plants grow within the canyon. The 27 stranded women camp about four miles away from where Jonathan crash lands. They camp in their wrecked ship which has a stream close by to it. There is small game to eat like the furry creature that Ann spears and ties off to her belt. They still use the dining hall on the ship for their meals, and go out daily to hunt, fish, and forage for fruits and berries. \nThe asteroid will cross the interplanetary shipping lane every three years in its orbit, meaning that every three years there is a chance they may come into contact with transport ships again. This creates a sense of pioneering prosperity for Johnathan who decides he wants to live with the 27 women on the asteroid and use the fertile land to grow tobacco and then sell it every three years when a freight ship comes by.\n"

        "Summary_1": "The Jupiter Food-growers Association enlisted many women to travel out to the colonies to serve as wives and promote happiness as well as breed a new generation. However, on their way to Jupiter, their spaceship crashed into an asteroid, and only 27 of the women survived. In the three years since the crash, these women have learned to hunt, forage, and defend themselves against the native species there, Centaurs. They developed a society based on sharing and generosity, shown through their individual chores that all serve the greater good. However, the two things they wished for were a rescue mission or a man. When Jonathan Fawkes arrived, their second wish came true. After they all met him, they each complimented him incessantly and offered him more food, drinks, and other sweet amenities. Being the first man they\u2019d seen in over three years, he was quite the rarity. ",
        "Summary_2": "The 27 women stuck on the asteroid have been stranded there for three years. They were on a ship bound for the Food-growers Association on Jupiter to become wives for the colonists but crash-landed on the asteroid. Some of the women did not survive, but those who did have learned to fend for themselves. Their only hope of leaving the asteroid is if a man comes and takes them away. When Ann discovers Jonathan, all the women are interested in him and want to \u201cwin\u201d him for themselves. They flirt shamelessly and help him, treating him almost like a princess. The women have learned to fend for themselves, hunt their food, and become quite strong. Jonathan thinks of them as amazons. Of course, the gravity on the asteroid is about thirty times weaker than that of Earth, which helps the women carry Jonathan when they tie him up to prevent him from getting away. They are so excited and desperate to see a man, they will do anything to prevent him from leaving. Their main wish is to be rescued, but the next best thing to being rescued is to have a man among them.",
        "Summary_3": "Originally, the women were part of a larger group that had been enlisted by the Jupiter Food-growers Association to journey to the colonies on Jupiter to become wives for the colonists. Before they reached their destination, they crash-landed on the same asteroid that Jonathan would crash on three years later. During those three years, the twenty-seven survivors turned their crash site into a livable encampment. Lucky for them, they had crashed in a deep valley near a stream and plenty of trees. Because of the lush foliage, they are able to collect an ample supply of fruits and berries, and there is plenty of wildlife to hunt including rabbits. As a result of the low gravity, the women's strength has magnified thirty times, so they are able to easily defend against the centaurs and provide for themselves. Although they are hoping to be rescued, they seem generally content in the makeshift society they have built together. The only thing they mention missing is the presence of a man, so when Jonathan arrives, they all fight over his personal attention.",
        "Summary_4": "Twenty-seven women survived a shipwreck on an asteroid while on their way to Jupiter to become the wives of the colonists there. They have been successfully living on the asteroid for three years, and hunt and gather the plentiful resources the land has to sustain themselves. They have to fight or evade dangerous Centaurs that are half man and half horse while they are out hunting, which they do by throwing rocks and yelling at them. They camp next to a stream in their wrecked ship, using the dining hall and staterooms for eating and living quarters. Jonathan finds them to be powerful and athletic, and frequently refers to them as Amazons. Many of them make forceful sexual advances on Jonathan, and they compete amongst themselves for his attention.\nWhen the asteroid orbits through the interplanetary shipping lane every three years, they become more likely to be rescued. When Jonathan intercepts Doctor Boynton and his two colleagues from the Interstellar Cosmography Society who have been commissioned to examine the asteroid, he tells them emphatically that he does not wish to be rescued. He would only like for them to send a freighter back in another three years to pick up the load of tobacco that he plans to grow with the seeds in the cargo of his shipwreck. The implication of what Jonathan has decided is that the twenty seven women will also likely remain on the asteroid for at least three more years because Jonathan has turned away their chance at being rescued.\n"

But to face the horrors of such a\n   \n  planet as this was too much.

He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling\ninto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n  \n \n  \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n  \n \n  \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that was three years ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her\neyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self\nconscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw\nyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a\nheap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp?

Friday\u2014all twenty-seven\nof them.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Jonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in his\narms.\n  \n \n  \"Catch a hold,\" said Billy, pushing back from the table. A dozen girls\nvolunteered with a rush. \"Hoist!\" said Billy. They lifted him like a\nsleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom,\nwhere they deposited him on the bed.\n  \n \n  Ann said to Olga; \"Help me with these boots.\" But they resisted every\ntug. \"It's no use,\" groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her bright\nyellow hair back from her eyes. \"His feet have swollen. We'll have to\ncut them off.\"\n  \n \n  At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cut off whose feet?\n   \n  \" he cried in alarm.\n  \n \n  \"Not your feet, silly,\" said Ann. \"Your boots.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lay a hand on those boots,\" he scowled; \"and I'll make me another pair\nout of your hides. They set me back a week's salary.\" Having delivered\nhimself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.\n  \n \n  Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. \"And this,\" she cried \"is what\nwe've been praying for during the last three years.\"\n  \n \n  The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a\ncane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced\nall around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he\npresumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits\nand berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He\nwalked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be\nhanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.\n  \n \n  He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by\ntwenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it\noff in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the\nshade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be\nyears before they were rescued.\n  \n \n  As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join\nthe centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plains\non the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde was\nambling toward him.\n  \n \n  \"How's the invalid?\" she said, seating herself beside him.\n  \n \n  \"Hot, isn't it?\" he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed the\nflat of her hand on his chest and shoved. \"\n   \n   Ooof!\n   \n  \" he grunted. He sat\ndown rather more forcibly than he had risen.\n  \n \n  \"Don't get up because of me,\" she informed him. \"It's my turn to cook,\nbut I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do\nyou know that you are irresistible?\" She seized his shoulders, stared\ninto his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a\nhungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his brow\nwith his sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"Suppose the rest should come,\" he said in an embarrassed voice.\n  \n \n  \"They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Your\neyes,\" she said, \"are like deep mysterious pools.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure enough?\" said Jonathan with involuntary interest. He began to\nrecover his nerve.\n  \n \n  She said, \"You're the best looking thing.\" She rumpled his hair. \"I\ncan't keep my eyes off you.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. \"Ouch!\" He winced. He had\nforgotten his sore muscles.\n  \n \n  \"I forgot,\" said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.\n\"You're hurt.\"\n  \n \n  He pulled her back down. \"Not so you could notice it,\" he grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. \"We're\n   \n   all\n   \n  glad to hear that!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerked\naround. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their\nfeatures were grim. He said: \"I don't feel so well after all.\"\n  \n \n  \"It don't wash,\" said Billy. \"It's time for a showdown.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take\nher stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a\nmenacing angle. She said in an angry voice: \"He's mine. I found him.\nLeave him alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where do you get that stuff?\" cried Olga. \"Share and share alike, say\nI.\"\n  \n \n  \"We could draw straws for him,\" suggested the green-eyed blonde.\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Jonathan broke in. \"I've got some say in the matter.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have not,\" snapped Billy. \"You'll do just as we say.\" She took a\nstep toward him.\n  \n \n  Jonathan edged away in consternation.\n  \n \n  \"He's going to run!\" Olga shouted.\n  \n \n  Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the\nplain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothing\nrelaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettes\nat the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.\n  \n \n  At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs,\nhe scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his space\nship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted and\ntore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside the\nwreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscription\nin silver letters: \"INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.\"\n  \n \n  Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced in\nsurprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon Ray\nRifle in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Jonathan Fawkes,\" said the castaway as he panted up, \"pilot for\nUniversal. I was wrecked.\"\n  \n \n  A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed\nmustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a\nyellow composition holder. He said, \"I'm Doctor Boynton.\" He had a\nrich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. \"We are members of the\nInterstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a\ncursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr.\nFawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning\nwhen we sighted the wreck.\"\n  \n \n  \"I say,\" said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim,\nenergetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun\ngingerly, respectfully. \"We're a week overdue now,\" he said. \"If you\nhave any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd\nbest be getting them aboard.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward\nthem from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was\nbarefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around\nher sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her\nbrown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table\ncloth at one time in its history.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a\nman!\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann.\n  \n \n  \"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\"\n  \n \n  A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off\nwarily.\n  \n \n  Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way\nhe had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the\ncanyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the\nbend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.\n  \n \n  Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer\nweight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up\nbodily, started up the canyon chanting: \"\n   \n   He was a rocket riding daddy\nfrom Mars.\n   \n  \" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.\n  \n \n  Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the\nspaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had\nbeen broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of\nhis left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy,\ntough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from\nmortification.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\"\n  \n \n  \"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being\nheld aloft by four barbarous young women.\n  \n \n  \"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a\nbreak.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between\ntwo husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease\nwith which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light\nweight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the\nplains. He wished he was a centaur.\n  \n \n  The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan\npicked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised\none of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow\nledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from\nunder him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment\nhe thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck,\nhauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a\nrope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top\nlike a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.\n  \n \n  The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking\nthe prairie.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge.\n  \n \n  A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first,\nJonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up\nthey resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to\nhis own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>  \"Any problem posed by one group of\nhuman beings can be resolved by any\nother group.\" That's what the Handbook\nsaid. But did that include primitive\nhumans? Or the Bees? Or a ...\n  \n \n  CONTROL GROUP\n  \n \n  By ROGER DEE\n  \n<doc-sep>Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space\nship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They\nwere the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he\nrealized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown\nof concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.\n  \n \n  On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward\nthem.\n  \n \n  She said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her\nstomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared\nafter her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice.\n  \n \n  He let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like\nhe was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled\nafter the girl. \"What's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I\ndidn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which\nleads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach\nthe hills we'll be safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was\nwrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head\nforemost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom,\nwinced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the\nhills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.\n  \n \n  \"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted.\n  \n \n  \"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could\nget around in the hills.\"\n  \n \n  The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a\ngorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon\nof sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the\ncrevices and floor of the canyon.\n  \n \n  They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped\naway, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her\narm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied\nit to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded\nhim. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year\n3372; not the time of ancient Greece.\n  \n \n  The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more\nprecipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the\nuniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.\n\"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette\npackage, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope.\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we\nwere here.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the\nfreighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her\ngrip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship.\nI don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley\ntobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on\nGanymede.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly\ndetached her hand.\n  \n \n  The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.\n\"We are going to the camp,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from\nunder her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.\n  \n \n  A voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "At first, Jonathan Fawkes claims that he is most uncomfortable around women. Despite being a galavanting spaceman known around the universe for his strength and bravery, he is in awe and possibly fearful only of women. When he first arrives on the asteroid and encounters Ann, he is immensely uncomfortable with her gaze on him, and that continues as he discovers that she can overpower him in his weakened state quite easily. As the rest of the stranded women arrive, they all ogle at him and tell him how incredibly handsome he is. This only makes him even more uncomfortable. \nHowever, by the end of the story, he wraps his arms around Ann and would have embraced her had they not been caught by the others. The rest of the women vie for his attention, and he runs off back to his spaceship. At first, the reader might think it\u2019s because he needs to get away from the girls or that he can\u2019t handle the pressure. However, his encounter with the potential rescuers proves that he is now far more comfortable around the women. He ran back to his spaceship to grab his cigarettes and tobacco seeds. He always planned to return to the women and does not tell the rescuers about them. \nAlthough at first, he was terrified of the girls, by the end he too is infatuated and loves the situation at hand. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Jonathan undergoes a complete role reversal with the women on the asteroid. At first, Jonathan is rather uncomfortable at all the attention the 27 women pay him. He isn\u2019t accustomed to women openly flirting with him, being possessive of him, or being the center of their attention. He also isn\u2019t accustomed to women having control over him. When he wants to go back to his ship for his cartons of cigarettes and Ann tries to stop him, he tries to thwart her physically. But when other women join them and Ann explains what is happening, the women gang up together, tackle him, tie him up, and carry him to prevent him from going. As a big, rangy, tough man, he feels completely humiliated for the women to have the upper hand over him. The humiliation continues when he starts to slide over the edge of the narrow ledge, and the women save him and tie a rope around his waist like he\u2019s a baby on a leash. The women talk openly to him about his physical attractiveness and invite him to join them in private activities. The whole scene is much like what single women experience when they are in a group of men, and Jonathan doesn\u2019t know what to make of it. As the object of their attention, he finds he has no say in what they plan to do with him when Ann claims he belongs to her since she found him and others say they should all share him. However, when the men from the Interstellar Cosmography Society find Jonathan\u2019s ship and meet him, offering to take him with them, he tells them he has decided he likes it on the asteroid and will be staying there to raise tobacco. He doesn\u2019t mention the 27 women because he has decided that he likes the center of their attention.\n",
        "Summary_3": "When Jonathan first meets Ann Clotilde, he feels a little embarrassed and uncomfortable because being around beautiful women makes him feel awkward and nervous. He follows Ann back to the encampment because he is injured and unfamiliar with the environment of the asteroid. Jonathan is a tall and large man, but the women easily apprehend him, which makes him sulk. His sulking leads to him nearly falling off the cliff, and the women have to save him. He feels even more uncomfortable when he arrives at the encampment and meets the rest of the twenty-seven survivors of the crash. They are all beautiful women--he calls them Amazons--and they flirt with him incessantly calling him handsome and attractive. Unsure of their true intentions with him, Jonathan walks around the encampment with an exaggerated limp, hoping to garner their sympathy. As he does this, Ann corners him, and suddenly he feels a desire to flirt with her back until all of the women arrive and want to fight for his attention. Jonathan escapes back to his ship to get his cigarettes and finds a cosmography society there to survey the asteroid. They offer him a ride home, but he decides he wants to stay. Before, Jonathan wanted to escape from the women, but now he realizes he is happy there and wants to return.",
        "Summary_4": "Jonathan Fawkes is a space pilot with Universal, known in the interplanetary transport business as a man to leave alone. He thinks of himself as big and tough, and over the years he has picked up three broken noses and had a scar on his left cheek from a bar brawl. When the women capture him and tie him up to take him to their camp he says he has never been so humiliated in his life. He feels intimidated and scared by the sexual advances of the women, especially one named Olga, and wishes he could run away or retreat on several occasions.\nA transformation occurs when he is approached by Ann in the stream the morning after he sleeps at the women\u2019s camp. He switches from trying to escape to succumbing to her sexual advance. When the other women discover them together and Ann uses her spear to try to defend her claim over him, he runs back to his ship. However, he is only running back to his ship to gather supplies like tools, tobacco seeds from the cargo he was supposed to be delivering when he shipwrecked, and cigarettes. Even with the offer to go home from Doctor Boynton and his two colleagues from the Interstellar Cosmography Society who land on the asteroid and find his wreck, he decides that he will stay here with the women. They think he has lost his mind, but Jonathan sees an opportunity for himself now to live on the asteroid with the women and farm tobacco that he can sell to passing freighters in another three years when the orbit will cross the interplanetary shipping lane again.\n"

        "Article": "\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept\nit as fact. There\u2014through the viewport and in it\u2014was a garden. A\ngarden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had\nnever seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the\nworld's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless,\nit was a garden.\n  \n \n  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\n  \n \n  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\"\nhe admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\n  \n \n  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could\nnot tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the\nviewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking\u2014the\nword seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless\nit were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere\nwas the garden and the world had arrived.\n  \n \n  \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants\nare different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then they've changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, merely different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what about the viewport?\n   \n   It\n   \n  changed. Where are the stars?\nWhere are they, Chuls, if it did not change?\"\n  \n \n  \"The stars come out at night.\"\n  \n \n  \"So there is a change from day to night!\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they\nshine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once they shone all the time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" said Crifer, becoming interested. \"They are variable.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it.

He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\nthrough a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\nexordium of\n   \n   Isaiah\n   \n  36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\nwhat was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.\n  \n \n  The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\noffal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\nspacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\nSlimeheads remember the H. M. S.\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  fiasco, for example, in which a\ngalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\nshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\nthe\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\nof the\n   \n   Benjo Maru\n   \n  incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\nhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\n   \n   Saccharomycodes\n   \n  yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\nPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\nthe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\nbite he ate to a superior grade of\n   \n   sake\n   \n  . And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\n   \n   Charles Partlow\nSale\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Sale\n   \n  blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be planted\nin the\n   \n   maria\n   \n  to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n  \n \n  Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n  \n \n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n   \n   C. P. Sale\n   \n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n  \n \n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n  \n \n  The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness.\n  \n",

There, Dan meets Blote, a strange, giant-like creature, who asks him what happened to Manny and Fiorello. Blote, the apparent head of the art schemes, requests that Dan join the team to replace them. Dan refuses, and asks about the carrier, referring to it as a time machine; Blote is perplexed, unaware of the concept of a time machine, and demands that Dan find one in exchange for a reward, and for avoiding trouble for trespassing. Dan, unsure of where to retrieve a time machine, bluffs and manages to take Blote back to Snithian's, where he abandons him. Suddenly, Dan hears a siren, and the carrier travels to a park. The carrier becomes frosted over as a man emerges to confront him. The man introduces himself as an agent of the Inter-Dimensional Monitor Service.",
        "Summary_2": "Dan Slane approaches Clyde Snithian to tell about a flaw in the guarding system for paintings. There are more than two hundred bodyguards across the house but none in the vault, which is dangerous, because recently art collections were disappearing from locked vaults all over the world. Clyde refuses to waste more money on security and walks away, while Kelly, who is responsible for security, agrees to hire Dan for cheap. Dan makes himself comfortable at the new workplace and waits for the thieves to find out how they break in, which is his real goal. After eight hours, a framework appears in the air with two figures from the future sitting within, who soon step out into the vault. The two men, Manny and Fiorello, open and admire the paintings from the shelves without noticing Dan. When they realize his presence, the men try to back off and pretend to confuse the rooms. When Dan starts proposing a deal, Kelly's voice proclaims Dan a crook. Dan wants to join the departing men, and as there is only room for two, he aims the pistol at Manny. A fight for place happens and Kelly enters, grabbing Manny. Fiorello rushes to help his friend, another cop moves towards Dan, who enters the time machine and pulls a lever at random. Dan's plan goes wrong but he has the machine for himself as he wanted and he needs to figure out the controls. He emerges into a kitchen and then moves through the house to avoid being seen, unable to travel in time. Dan nearly crashes into a building but suddenly finds himself in an office with a weird creature at the desk. The boss asks about his two employees and Dan's coming. The creature comes from Vorplisch and proposes to Dan to take the place of Manny and Fiorello. When Dan mentions the time-machine, it turns out that the framework is a simple carrier, but a time-machine intrigues the creature who believes the humans have developed one. The creature introduces himself as Blote and warns Dan against trying to leave. He also tasks Dan with securing a time-machine for Blote, otherwise, Dan will be dealt harshly with. Dan points at the first name in the phone book and Blote decides to accompany him to the office to buy a time-machine. Blote is surprised he missed this development. The two drive towards the pointed building and get into it in secret. Inside, someone catches Blote for the break-in and Dan leaves in the carrier. Some noise appears from the machine and Dan finds himself in a park, where another creature named Dzhackoon appears, he is from Inter-dimensional Monitor Service. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Clyde W. Snithian is meeting with Dan Slane. Dan has told Eddie Kelly that he to see Snithian regarding the safeguarding of his paintings. Although Snithian has stationed two hundred and twenty-five guards working at all times, nobody is in the vault with the paintings. Snithian thinks it is unnecessary, but Kelly finds that Dan has a point. Snithian thinks it is unnecessary, but he is hired secretly anyway because he is willing to work cheaply. His purpose of doing this job is to see whoever has been stealing art from collections without entering the usual way. Since the Snithian collection is the largest west of the Mississippi, he waits inside and sees how the thieves operate. Eight hours later, Dan wakes up from his light doze when an apparition in the shape of an open-work cage with two figures inside suddenly materializes. Two men rise out of the cage, and they are pleased that the collection is fully-stocked. The shorter man, named Manny, complains that there are no nood dames. The taller man, named Fiorello, remarks on the artistic techniques of the paintings. Dan suddenly interrupts their conversation, and the two try to come up with excuses. Suddenly, Mr. Kelly\u2019s voice interrupts them as he assumes that Dan is working with the two. Dan points a pistol at Manny and tells him to stay because he will go with Fiorello; Kelly and three cops suddenly appear to confront them. As they struggle, Dan gets into the machine and tries to get a grip on the controls. He neutralizes the control lever to rest an inch above the floor, and a young girl appears at the end of the hallway. The girl gets ready to get into a tub, and as she whirls to see if there is anybody, the cage shoots with great acceleration. He scrambles out of the cage once he reaches his destination and sees a large man with too many hands behind a desk. The man is a Vorplischer, and he is confused when Dan calls the contraption a time machine. It is simply a carrier, and beachball says that his superiors will be delighted with any knowledge of a time machine. He introduces himself as Blote and tells Dan to bring back a small time machine. Dan pretends to bluff, and Blote says that he will go with him to the location he has picked. As Dan leads him through the building area in the cage, Manny and Fiorello come back for revenge. The carrier, with Dan in it, shoots away again; he begins to hear sirens as it goes to a new location. Although it does not catch the attention of anyone, Dan steps out to investigate as a dark-skinned, long-nosed, and  tall figure in a white uniform approaches him. The man, named Dzhackoon, introduces himself as a member of the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service and tells him that he is glad Dan stopped. Dan is confused and asks what Dzhackoon wants from him. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Dan Slane in Clyde W. Snithian\u2019s office. Dan is trying to convince Clyde that he has a deficiency in his security details and he would be the perfect person to fix the issuer. He is dismissed by the man, but Kelly, Clyde\u2019s head of security pulls him aside and informs him that he will hire him. Dan agrees to the conditions and is quickly put to work to monitor the vault by staying inside of it. \n\nDan\u2019s plan is to catch the thieves that are entering vaults and successfully stealing artwork. He has a suspicion that there is time travel involved in the plan. He suddenly wakes up and notices two frames in the vault with him. They are discussing their mission and the paintings that they spot in the vault. One of them eventually notices Dan, and he tries to stammer out a reply. He tells the two men, Fiorella and Manny, that he wants to join them. Kelly, who is listening into the fault, overhears Dan betraying him and shouts as such over a speaker installed in the vault. Dan gets into the carrier and successfully steals it. He figures out how to operate it and eventually ends up at the office of Blote. Blote, a Fourth Class Trader employed by the Vegan Confederation, is the boss of Manny and Fiorello. He\u2019s not mad at Dan and is willing to allow Dan to join his operations. During their discussions, Dan keeps insisting that a carrier is a time machine. Blote misunderstands Dan\u2019s assertions and believes him to not be referring to the carrier as he has never heard of someone successfully inventing the time machine. Blote then insists that Dan immediately take him to a time machine. Dan agrees to do so, and Blote controls the carrier to take both of them there. However, it is a trap and they end up in the vault where Manny and Fiorello still are trapped. Manny, Fiorello, and Blote are all angry with Dan and try to take control of the carrier. Dan is able to get away and he quickly moves the carrier into a different location. When the carrier settles again, he is greeted by a strange-looking figure that speaks to him in French. After some slight discussion between the two, Dan is told that he is in a place called the Anglic colonial sector and that the man is with the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service. It is clear that Dan has ended up in another strange and unknown location and is confused by his predicament. \n"

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",

Once Dan escapes through the carrier, he finds himself passing through different rooms, including a kitchen, hallway, and bedroom. The carrier then takes him to an office in a skyscraper, with posters, framed paintings, and a desk, where he finds Blote. After returning back to Snithian's, the carrier takes him to a large park.",

Soon a framework appears in the air with two people in armchairs. A mess takes place and Dan enters the framework alone.

When Blote is caught, Dan takes the carrier to the park, accompanied bosom siren-like noise. In the park he faces a tall man reminding Blote. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story is initially set at Clyde W. Snithian\u2019s home. There is a vault full of paintings that is unguarded until Dan offers to become a guard. In the vault, there are shelves stacked with wrapped paintings under a low ceiling. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs also light the place up. To prepare Dan, Kelly has also ordered a neat-white refrigerator, a bunk, an arm-chair, a bookshelf, and a small table. The table is set with paper plates, plastic utensils, and a radio. Inside the fridge, Dan finds salami, liverwurst, cheese, and beer. The carrier that arrives in is an open-work cage about the size and shape of an outhouse minus the sheathing. There are two contoured chairs too. When Dan grabs the lever, he finds himself in a room with walls that glow blue. There is also a second lever present too. There is a third lever that causes the carrier to rise. The levers themselves do not have any controls written by them, and they are all plain, unadorned black. They look like ordinary circuit-breaker type knife-switches, and even the entire carrier looks hastily thrown together. He reaches an area with a hallway and goes into a bedroom shortly after. It is a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a four-poster bed with a flowered canopy, and a dressing table. The area he is in has a terrace. Then, he steers the machine to a plain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window, and a planter filled with glowing blue plants. In the room, there is also a ten-foot-square sunken tub. The office that Blote is in is painted a simple brown, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through elaborate Venetian blinds. There is also a potted plant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and a desk on the far side of the room. Posters also line the walls of the office. The Time office that they go to is a square, five-story structure with lettering. The location is two twenty-one Maple Street. There is a dimly seen office, a second floor, and a barely visible corridor. Finally, when he gets into the carrier again, it takes him to an area where there is a landscape of trees and houses. He stops at the corner of a wide park. \n",

There is a refrigerator, a bed, an armchair, a table, and a bookshelf along with other useful supplies for Dan to live in the vault. After taking the travel apparatus from the two art thieves, Fiorello and Manny, Dan ends up at the office of Blote. Under false pretences, Dan and Blote both end up traveling back to the vault where Manny and Fiorello still are trapped. Dan successfully is able to maneuver the three away from the carrier and he navigates it to a different location away from the vault. When Dan steps out of the carrier, he meets a strange-looking man.

Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers\nalong both sides of the passage at once.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines\nemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where\nthey do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered\nleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous\nfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed\nwrong\u2014\n  \n \n  The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.\nBlote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete\nwalls, the barred door and\u2014\n  \n \n  \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n  \n \n  \"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\n  \n \n  Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt\nto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a\nlever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures\nas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the\nclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was no\ntelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide\nthe carrier, then\u2014\n  \n \n  A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.\nDan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\n  \n \n  The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of\nmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous\nlandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the\ndeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.\nIf the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked\nthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\n  \n \n  The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought\nthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few\ninches and cut the switch.\n  \n \n  As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\n  \n \n  Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise\nwas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians\nin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why\nhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no\nsound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a\nsecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,\nreached for the controls\u2014\n  \n \n  There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials\nbefore him frosted over. There was a loud\n   \n   pop!\n   \n  like a flashbulb\nexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle\nwhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded\nto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a\ntight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,\nthe long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly\nred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat\npillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set\nyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in\na smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Alors, monsieur\n   \n  ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in\na quick bow. \"\n   \n   Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n  \n \n  \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.\nPermit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class\nfive, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\"\n  \n \n  Dzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to\nstop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our\nlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Your superiors?\" Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he\ncould reach the machine and try a getaway\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,\" the beachball said,\nfollowing Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch\nyellow cylinder lying on the desk. \"Until the carrier is fueled, I'm\nafraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best\nintroduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth\nClass, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop\nnew sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire\nSecondary Quadrant.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That\n   \n   has\n   \n  to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just\nmaterialize out of thin air like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,\" Blote said. \"You\nshouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel,\nthat everyone has. Now\u2014\" Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper\u2014\"I'll\nmake a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good\ncondition for me. And in return\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  supposed to supply\n   \n   you\n   \n  with a time machine?\"\n  \n \n  Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. \"I dislike pointing it out,\nDan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal\nentry, illegal possession of property, trespass\u2014then doubtless some\nembarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr.\nKelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would\ndeal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.\"\nThe Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the\ndesk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.\n  \n \n  \"Whereas, on the other hand,\" Blote's bass voice went on, \"you and me\ngot the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up\nwith an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I\nshould say. What about it, Dan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, let me see,\" Dan temporized. \"Time machine. Time machine\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,\" Blote rumbled ominously.\n  \n \n  \"I'd better look in the phone book,\" Dan suggested.\n  \n \n  Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.\n  \n \n  \"Time, time. Let's see....\" He brightened. \"Time, Incorporated; local\nbranch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.\"\n  \n \n  \"A sales center?\" Blote inquired. \"Or a manufacturing complex?\"\n  \n \n  \"Both,\" Dan said. \"I'll just nip over and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, Dan,\" Blote said. \"I'll accompany you.\" He\ntook the directory, studied it.\n  \n \n  \"Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice\nit. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a\nlarge.\" He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel\ncells. \"Now, off to gather in the time machine.\" He took his place in\nthe carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. \"Come, Dan.\nGet a wiggle on.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n   THE STAR-SENT KNAVES\n   \n \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by Gaughan\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of Tomorrow June 1963\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  When the Great Galactic Union first encounters\n   \n  Earth ... is this what is going to happen?\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Clyde W. Snithian was a bald eagle of a man, dark-eyed, pot-bellied,\nwith the large, expressive hands of a rug merchant. Round-shouldered\nin a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane's\ntravel-stained six foot one.\n  \n \n  \"Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me.\" He nodded toward\nthe florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like something\nthat needed oiling. \"Something about important information regarding\nsafeguarding my paintings.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, Mr. Snithian,\" Dan said. \"I believe I can be of great\nhelp to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me....\" The red eyes bored\ninto Dan like hot pokers.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guards\nhere\u2014the papers are full of it\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press,\nI'd have no concern for my paintings today!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been left\nunguarded.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\" Kelly started.\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" Snithian cut in.\n  \n \n  \"You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds day\nand night\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Two hundred and twenty-five,\" Kelly snapped.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014but no one at all in the vault with the paintings,\" Slane finished.\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Snithian shrilled. \"Why should I post a man in the\nvault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault,\" Dan said.\n\"There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.\"\n  \n \n  \"By the saints, he's right,\" Kelly exclaimed. \"Maybe we ought to have a\nman in that vault.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,\" Snithian snapped. \"I've\nmade you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more\nnonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!\" Snithian turned and stalked\naway, his cloak flapping at his knees.\n  \n \n  \"I'll work cheap,\" Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. \"I'm an\nart lover.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He\nturned in at an office and closed the door.\n  \n \n  \"Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If\nthose pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad.\nJust how cheap would you work?\"\n  \n \n  \"A hundred dollars a week,\" Dan said promptly. \"Plus expenses,\" he\nadded.\n  \n \n  Kelly nodded. \"I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. If\nyou're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,\neyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n  \n \n  \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to\nLethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last\ntime anybody would ever board the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  alive. His stomach\nwent flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n  \n \n  If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end\nof shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind\nsearching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like\na smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,\nwater-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy\njet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be\neliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored\nbecause of his gun.\n  \n \n  Kriere would make odds impossible.\n  \n \n  Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n  \n \n  Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,\nfooled\u2014somehow. But\u2014how?\n  \n \n  Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade\nwhere Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,\nartery\u2014heart.\n  \n \n  There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and\nthis would be the last trip.\n  \n \n  Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n  \n \n  \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there\nwas too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in\nthe center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the\nstar-port.\"\n  \n \n  Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.\nBurnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back\nkept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet\nsings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,\nwhy\u2014\n  \n \n  Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of\nstars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about\nto be rescued.\n  \n \n  Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he\nwas about to end a ten-years' war.\n  \n \n  There was only\n   \n   one\n   \n  way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be\nfast.\n  \n \n  Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as\nit had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a\ngood sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered\ndirections, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies\nfrom space.\n  \n \n  Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,\ntoo.\n  \n \n  The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its\nslowness.\n  \n \n  It reached Kriere.\n  \n \n  Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n  \n \n  The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.\n  \n \n \n \n  Lethla watched.\n  \n \n  He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You\nknow, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the\n   \n   Constellation\n   \n  . I believe it.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\nthrough a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\nexordium of\n   \n   Isaiah\n   \n  36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\nwhat was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.\n  \n \n  The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\noffal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\nspacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\nSlimeheads remember the H. M. S.\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  fiasco, for example, in which a\ngalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\nshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\nthe\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\nof the\n   \n   Benjo Maru\n   \n  incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\nhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\n   \n   Saccharomycodes\n   \n  yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\nPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\nthe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\nbite he ate to a superior grade of\n   \n   sake\n   \n  . And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\n   \n   Charles Partlow\nSale\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Sale\n   \n  blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be planted\nin the\n   \n   maria\n   \n  to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n  \n \n  Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n  \n \n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n   \n   C. P. Sale\n   \n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n  \n \n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n  \n \n  The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness.\n  \n<doc-sep>Shock momentarily immobilized Chip. Not so the bartender. He was, it\nseemed, an ardent pacifist.

When Dan asks him about the time machine, however, he assumes that Dan is talking about how he knows where to get one. Dan is confused since he thinks that a carrier is a time machine. However, he becomes shocked once he realizes what Blote wants him to do for him to pay back for taking the carrier. To escape, he bluffs Blote into taking him to the fake Time location. Although Blote trusts him, Dan betrays this trust once Manny and Fiorello appear, leaving the three of them behind. ",
        "Summary_4": "Dan and Blote meet after Dan takes the apparatus from Fiorello and Manny after their tussle in the vault. Blote is the boss of Fiorello and Manny. Blote does not appear to be mad at Dan and even tries to recruit Dan to join his operations. He speaks very matter of fact to Dan and appears to try to answer his questions even though he does become confused at some of them. He trusts Dan to show him where to find a time machine and they both get on the carrier to go to the supposed location. However, Dan eventually betrays this trust and leads him into a trap. Then Dan ultimately takes the carrier again and goes to another unknown location. "

Snithian was a bald eagle of a man, dark-eyed, pot-bellied,\nwith the large, expressive hands of a rug merchant. Round-shouldered\nin a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane's\ntravel-stained six foot one.\n  \n \n  \"Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me.\" He nodded toward\nthe florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like something\nthat needed oiling. \"Something about important information regarding\nsafeguarding my paintings.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, Mr. Snithian,\" Dan said. \"I believe I can be of great\nhelp to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me....\" The red eyes bored\ninto Dan like hot pokers.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guards\nhere\u2014the papers are full of it\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press,\nI'd have no concern for my paintings today!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been left\nunguarded.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\" Kelly started.\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" Snithian cut in.\n  \n \n  \"You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds day\nand night\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Two hundred and twenty-five,\" Kelly snapped.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014but no one at all in the vault with the paintings,\" Slane finished.\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Snithian shrilled. \"Why should I post a man in the\nvault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault,\" Dan said.\n\"There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.\"\n  \n \n  \"By the saints, he's right,\" Kelly exclaimed. \"Maybe we ought to have a\nman in that vault.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,\" Snithian snapped. \"I've\nmade you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more\nnonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!\" Snithian turned and stalked\naway, his cloak flapping at his knees.\n  \n \n  \"I'll work cheap,\" Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. \"I'm an\nart lover.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He\nturned in at an office and closed the door.\n  \n \n  \"Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If\nthose pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad.\nJust how cheap would you work?\"\n  \n \n  \"A hundred dollars a week,\" Dan said promptly. \"Plus expenses,\" he\nadded.\n  \n \n  Kelly nodded. \"I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. If\nyou're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Dan looked around at the gray walls, with shelves stacked to the low\nceiling with wrapped paintings. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs shed a\nwhite glare over the tile floor, a neat white refrigerator, a bunk,\nan arm-chair, a bookshelf and a small table set with paper plates,\nplastic utensils and a portable radio\u2014all hastily installed at Kelly's\norder. Dan opened the refrigerator, looked over the stock of salami,\nliverwurst, cheese and beer. He opened a loaf of bread, built up a\nwell-filled sandwich, keyed open a can of beer.\n  \n \n  It wasn't fancy, but it would do. Phase one of the plan had gone off\nwithout a hitch.\n  \n \n  Basically, his idea was simple. Art collections had been disappearing\nfrom closely guarded galleries and homes all over the world. It was\nobvious that no one could enter a locked vault, remove a stack of large\ncanvases and leave, unnoticed by watchful guards\u2014and leaving the locks\nundamaged.\n  \n \n  Yet the paintings were gone. Someone had been in those vaults\u2014someone\nwho hadn't entered in the usual way.\n  \n \n  Theory failed at that point; that left the experimental method. The\nSnithian collection was the largest west of the Mississippi. With\nsuch a target, the thieves were bound to show up. If Dan sat in the\nvault\u2014day and night\u2014waiting\u2014he would see for himself how they\noperated.\n  \n \n  He finished his sandwich, went to the shelves and pulled down one of\nthe brown-paper bundles. Loosening the string binding the package, he\nslid a painting into view. It was a gaily colored view of an open-air\ncafe, with a group of men and women in gay-ninetyish costumes gathered\nat a table. He seemed to remember reading something about it in a\nmagazine. It was a cheerful scene; Dan liked it. Still, it hardly\nseemed worth all the effort....\n  \n \n  He went to the wall switch and turned off the lights. The orange glow\nof the filaments died, leaving only a faint illumination from the\nnight-light over the door. When the thieves arrived, it might give him\na momentary advantage if his eyes were adjusted to the dark. He groped\nhis way to the bunk.\n  \n \n  So far, so good, he reflected, stretching out. When they showed up,\nhe'd have to handle everything just right. If he scared them off\nthere'd be no second chance. He would have lost his crack at\u2014whatever\nhis discovery might mean to him.\n  \n \n  But he was ready. Let them come.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

But nothing like the\nweird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.\n    \n \n \n<doc-sep>Dan looked about wildly. The voice seemed to be issuing from a speaker.\nIt appeared Kelly hedged his bets.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Kelly, I can explain everything!\" Dan called. He turned back to\nFiorello. \"Listen, I figured out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty clever!\" Kelly's voice barked. \"Inside job. But it takes more\nthan the likes of you to out-fox an old-timer like Eddie Kelly.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you were right, Manny,\" Fiorello said. \"Complications are\narising. We'd best depart with all deliberate haste.\" He edged toward\nthe cage.\n  \n \n  \"What about this ginzo?\" Manny jerked a thumb toward Dan. \"He's on to\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't be helped.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look\u2014I want to go with you!\" Dan shouted.\n  \n \n  \"I'll bet you do!\" Kelly's voice roared. \"One more minute and I'll have\nthe door open and collar the lot of you! Came up through a tunnel, did\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't go, my dear fellow,\" Fiorello said. \"Room for two, no more.\"\n  \n \n  Dan whirled to the cot, grabbed up the pistol Kelly had supplied. He\naimed it at Manny. \"You stay here, Manny! I'm going with Fiorello in\nthe time machine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you nuts?\" Manny demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm flattered, dear boy,\" Fiorello said, \"but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's get moving. Kelly will have that lock open in a minute.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't leave me here!\" Manny spluttered, watching Dan crowd into\nthe cage beside Fiorello.\n  \n \n  \"We'll send for you,\" Dan said. \"Let's go, Fiorello.\"\n  \n \n  The balding man snatched suddenly for the gun. Dan wrestled with him.\nThe pistol fell, bounced on the floor of the cage, skidded into the\nfar corner of the vault. Manny charged, reaching for Dan as he twisted\naside; Fiorello's elbow caught him in the mouth. Manny staggered back\ninto the arms of Kelly, bursting red-faced into the vault.\n  \n \n  \"Manny!\" Fiorello released his grip on Dan, lunged to aid his\ncompanion. Kelly passed Manny to one of three cops crowding in on his\nheels. Dan clung to the framework as Fiorello grappled with Kelly. A\ncop pushed past them, spotted Dan, moved in briskly for the pinch. Dan\ngrabbed a lever at random and pulled.\n  \n \n  Sudden silence fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral\nKelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan\nswallowed hard and nudged a second lever. The cage sank like an\nelevator into the floor, vivid blue washing up its sides.\n  \n \n  Hastily he reversed the control. Operating a time machine was tricky\nbusiness. One little slip, and the Slane molecules would be squeezing\nin among brick and mortar particles....\n  \n \n  But this was no time to be cautious. Things hadn't turned out just the\nway he'd planned, but after all, this was what he'd wanted\u2014in a way.\nThe time machine was his to command. And if he gave up now and crawled\nback into the vault, Kelly would gather him in and pin every art theft\nof the past decade on him.\n  \n \n  It couldn't be\n   \n   too\n   \n  hard. He'd take it slowly, figure out the\ncontrols....\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Your superiors?\" Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he\ncould reach the machine and try a getaway\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,\" the beachball said,\nfollowing Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch\nyellow cylinder lying on the desk. \"Until the carrier is fueled, I'm\nafraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best\nintroduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth\nClass, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop\nnew sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire\nSecondary Quadrant.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That\n   \n   has\n   \n  to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just\nmaterialize out of thin air like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,\" Blote said. \"You\nshouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel,\nthat everyone has. Now\u2014\" Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper\u2014\"I'll\nmake a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good\ncondition for me. And in return\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  supposed to supply\n   \n   you\n   \n  with a time machine?\"\n  \n \n  Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. \"I dislike pointing it out,\nDan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal\nentry, illegal possession of property, trespass\u2014then doubtless some\nembarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr.\nKelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would\ndeal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.\"\nThe Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the\ndesk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.\n  \n \n  \"Whereas, on the other hand,\" Blote's bass voice went on, \"you and me\ngot the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up\nwith an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I\nshould say. What about it, Dan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, let me see,\" Dan temporized. \"Time machine. Time machine\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,\" Blote rumbled ominously.\n  \n \n  \"I'd better look in the phone book,\" Dan suggested.\n  \n \n  Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.\n  \n \n  \"Time, time. Let's see....\" He brightened. \"Time, Incorporated; local\nbranch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.\"\n  \n \n  \"A sales center?\" Blote inquired. \"Or a manufacturing complex?\"\n  \n \n  \"Both,\" Dan said. \"I'll just nip over and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, Dan,\" Blote said. \"I'll accompany you.\" He\ntook the directory, studied it.\n  \n \n  \"Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice\nit. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a\nlarge.\" He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel\ncells. \"Now, off to gather in the time machine.\" He took his place in\nthe carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. \"Come, Dan.\nGet a wiggle on.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him.

Snithian declines, but Kelly, head of security, accepts, and that night Dan is settled into the vault. After a few hours, Dan is shocked to see a machine appear out of thin air, where two men appear to steal the art. Dan believes this is a time machine, but Kelly suddenly arrives and threatens to arrest Dan, believing he is part of an inside job. Dan attempts to escape with the carrier, and after a few detours, he ends up in the office of a large man named Blote. He asks Blote about the carrier, implying that it is a time machine, but Blote demands that Dan supply him with a time machine, as his people have never seen one. Dan leads Blote back to the Snithian office, where Manny and Fiorello see him, but he manages to escape once again. Then, Dan hears a siren as the carrier hurdles through the air, and he is met by a man who says he is from the Inter-dimensional Monitor Service. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dan has heard about painting being stolen from locked vaults and he has some guesses, which he wants to confirm. So he gets a job as a vault guard for cheap at Snithian's vault, where the collection is read and must attract the thieves. He faces two men exiting from a framework and believes them to come in a time-machine from the future. He asks to join them and as they don't have space for him, he attacks them and leaves alone. The plan goes wrong when Dan can't figure out how to control the machine and finds himself in a house full of people, He moves from one room to another trying not to be seen. Eventually, the carrier takes him to Blote's office who is a weirdly looking creature and who makes Dan scared. Dan is in danger and has to bluff, as Blote wants him to get a time-machine. So, the two enter an office where Dan leaves Blote behind and escapes the guard. On the way, he hears loud siren-like noise and stepson a park, where he meets another creature reminding Blote. ",
        "Summary_3": "Throughout the story, Dan goes to a variety of places via the carrier. He is initially hired as a guard, but he eventually escapes with the carrier. He is able to outsmart Manny and Fiorello, taking the carrier and going to a variety of rooms nearby. After, the carrier takes him to Blote, who then demands him to go retrieve a small time machine for further analysis. Not trusting that Dan won\u2019t escape on his own, Blote decides to go with him to see the time machines himself. Dan is once again traveling on the carrier by himself when he leaves Blote behind with the other two men who have come back for revenge. Then, he has an encounter with Dzhackoon, who sounds the alarm that causes him to land the carrier once again.",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Dan trying to convince a wealthy man to hire him onto the security detail for his valuable art collection. Dan has heard that valuable art has been stolen and he has his suspicions as to how. He does get hired by the head of security, Kelly, to live in the vault to guard it against potential thieves. Dan\u2019s predictions are somewhat accurate as two men do suddenly appear in the vault to steal the art. He then proceeds to try to convince them to take him with them as he believes that it is a time machine they are using to complete their heists. Kelly overhears this through the microphones he had installed in the vault and tells Dan that when he gets inside he will be punished. Dan becomes frantic and in a tussle with the two art thieves, Manny and Fiorello, he steals their apparatus and activates it to the best of his abilities. The following sequence of events has Dan transported to different locations that cause more confusion. The owner of the apparatus, or the carrier, does not confirm Dan\u2019s suspicion that it is a time machine and even seems confused by the question. Dan continues to travel to unknown locations without a clear way of returning to his proper location. "

Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\n  \n \n  And those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n   THE STAR-SENT KNAVES\n   \n \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by Gaughan\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of Tomorrow June 1963\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  When the Great Galactic Union first encounters\n   \n  Earth ... is this what is going to happen?\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Clyde W. Snithian was a bald eagle of a man, dark-eyed, pot-bellied,\nwith the large, expressive hands of a rug merchant. Round-shouldered\nin a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane's\ntravel-stained six foot one.\n  \n \n  \"Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me.\" He nodded toward\nthe florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like something\nthat needed oiling. \"Something about important information regarding\nsafeguarding my paintings.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, Mr. Snithian,\" Dan said. \"I believe I can be of great\nhelp to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me....\" The red eyes bored\ninto Dan like hot pokers.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guards\nhere\u2014the papers are full of it\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press,\nI'd have no concern for my paintings today!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been left\nunguarded.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\" Kelly started.\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" Snithian cut in.\n  \n \n  \"You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds day\nand night\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Two hundred and twenty-five,\" Kelly snapped.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014but no one at all in the vault with the paintings,\" Slane finished.\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Snithian shrilled. \"Why should I post a man in the\nvault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault,\" Dan said.\n\"There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.\"\n  \n \n  \"By the saints, he's right,\" Kelly exclaimed. \"Maybe we ought to have a\nman in that vault.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,\" Snithian snapped. \"I've\nmade you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more\nnonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!\" Snithian turned and stalked\naway, his cloak flapping at his knees.\n  \n \n  \"I'll work cheap,\" Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. \"I'm an\nart lover.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He\nturned in at an office and closed the door.\n  \n \n  \"Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If\nthose pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad.\nJust how cheap would you work?\"\n  \n \n  \"A hundred dollars a week,\" Dan said promptly. \"Plus expenses,\" he\nadded.\n  \n \n  Kelly nodded. \"I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. If\nyou're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  be\nexperiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they\nwere, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a\nsuggestion of urgency\u2014there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of\ninformation.\n  \n \n  Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser.\nHe knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time.\nAnd the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  would not complete its orbit of the planet for\ntwo weeks yet.\n  \n \n  Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used\nto wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the\nvicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went\nback inside.\n  \n \n  Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the\ncaptain himself:\n  \n \n  WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR\nSCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN ORDER!\n  \n \n  H. A. HESSE, CAPT.\n  \n \n  Kaiser pushed the last of his meal\u2014which he had been eating with his\nfingers\u2014into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his\nhands with it and dropped it to the floor.\n  \n \n  He pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding\nthe captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for\nserious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only\nto the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment.\nIt was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from\nthe ship on his trip.\n  \n<doc-sep>The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was\nher size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained\nsuch gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand\nfeet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable\nalienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully\nin the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with\nsomething like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff\nwere somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some\nstrange and alien way.\n  \n \n  It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for\ninter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of\nmystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave\nher birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was\nunthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she\nwas drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung\nabout Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away\nagain into the inter-stellar deeps.\n  \n \n  Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps\nyesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip\nthat bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We\nwould never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond\nthe ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know\nwhat killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she\nwas mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ...\nbut of what?\n  \n \n  We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would\nhave meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better\nequipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by\nmen. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank.\nLet the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and\nbrought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things\nfigured.\n  \n \n  The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed\nby the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared\na boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth\nmillions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and\ncrossed to her.\n  \n \n  In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their\nfaces.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit\nher tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives.\nShe's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage\ncompartments that are still unbroken.\"\n  \n \n  She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was\nnothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull\nalone was left.\n  \n \n  He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples\nof her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this\nstuff....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The\ncarcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and\nZaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her\ndown under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check\nthose compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When\nit's done report to me in my quarters.\"\n  \n \n  I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a\nmetallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff\nis worth anything....\"\n  \n \n  The metal was heavy\u2014too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship\nconstruction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that\ndistant world where this metal was made?\n  \n \n  Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal\ntorn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver;\nthose strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were\nthere too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of\nthe metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand.\n   \n   It had a\nyellowish tinge, and it was heavier\n   \n  ....\n  \n \n  Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held\nit grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm.\nSuddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It\nstruck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of\nmetallic lustre.\n  \n \n  For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying\nall the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a\nbalance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It\nwas no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The\nwhorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing\nvibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had\ndrawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal\u2014the\nstuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was\nbuilt\u2014was now....\n  \n \n \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my\ntable-top.\n   \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps,\nfrom some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ...\ndrawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability\nin its new environment. Stability as a terrene element\u2014wonderfully,\nmiraculously gold!\n  \n \n  And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of\nthis metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have\nbeen a wild sound in those moments of discovery....\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The main piece of equipment used in the story is the carrier that Manny and Fiorello arrive in. The carrier contains lots of different levers and controls that make it difficult to navigate. It is able to appear out of thin air, a cage-like structure that has a blue luminous glow to it. Despite the futuristic abilities of the carrier, it is made up of common parts and is not the sturdiest. The carrier is able to appear in random places, but it is also used by Blote to travel to Maple Street.",
        "Summary_2": "The vault is locked and guarded by armed people, Dan himself is supplied with a pistol. The two men appear in a glowing framework in the air, which Dan believes to be a time machine. Indeed, it's an inter-dimensional carrier which can travel rapidly through walls but not through time. It's equipped with multiple levers and controls, which are hard to figure. Siren-like sound is used by inter-dimensional Monitor Service to make the carriers stop. ",
        "Summary_3": "The carrier is the main piece of equipment used throughout the story. It is capable of taking its passengers to a variety of different places by using specific controls and can pass through walls undetected. It is how the art thieves were capable of stealing many pieces of art, despite the vaults often being heavily guarded or sealed. Another piece of equipment is the pistol that Dan points at Manny. It is supplied by Kelly, and Dan does not fire it but uses it to threaten the other man into staying so he can go aboard the carrier. Another piece of equipment used is the siren that Dzhackoon sounds. It sounds like a typical police siren, but nobody else hears it except for Dan. ",
        "Summary_4": "The main equipment that is used in the story is a travel apparatus that is used by Manny and Fiorello to get into the vault to steal valuable artwork. Dan believes it to be a time machine. He takes the apparatus from the two thieves and uses it to go to a different location where he meets Blote, the two thieves\u2019 boss. While on his journey, he figures out how to use the different levels on the machine to control the direction of travel. When he implies to Blote that it is a time machine, Blote is confused and shows that he does not know of the existence of a time machine. Blote calls the travel apparatus a carrier.  "
