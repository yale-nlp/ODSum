Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise\ntrade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students\nindeed!\" He snorted and walked away.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Second Secretary Magnan will be away from the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (MUDDLE) for two weeks, leaving Retief in charge. Magnan reminds Retief that his role is to act as a rubber stamp, continuing Magnan\u2019s actions. Magnan points out that Retief should appreciate that Bogan is participating in the Exchange Program. Its participation might be a step toward sublimating their aggression into more cultivated channels. The Bogans are sending two thousand students to d\u2019Land as exchange students, and Magnan thinks this might end their aggression and bring them into the cultural life of the Galaxy. Retief wonders aloud what the students will study in such a poor, industrial land. Magnan points out that this is none of Retief\u2019s concern and that his role is simply to facilitate bringing the two groups together. When Miss Furkle, the secretary, buzzes Magnan that the bucolic person from Lovenbroy is there again, Magnan pushes the meeting off onto Retief.\n\nThe person from Lovenbroy is named Hank Arapoulous. He is a farmer and tells Retief that the Bacchus vines that they use to make their wine mature every twelve years and that this year is a harvest year, but they are short on workers to harvest the grapes. They have a shortage of workers for the harvest due to their conflict over strip mining and the loss of several of their young men in the battles to prevent it. Also, Lovenbroy had to borrow money from Croanie, and the loan was due. The wine crop will put them in the clear if they can harvest it. The biggest concern is what Croanie will do with the land if they can\u2019t pay the loan; Lovenbroy has offered half its grape acreage as security for the loan it received. Hank asks Retief for a loan, but Retief tells him that MEDDLE\u2019s role is only for transportation. Hank says he also checked with the Labor Office, but it only offered to set them up with machinery. \n\nRetief attends a council meeting and learns that Croanie will receive a shipment of strip mining equipment. A spokesman for the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations\u2019 General Economies (SCROUNGE) indicates he has been trying to get mining equipment for d\u2019Land. He tells Retief that Boge is a troublemaker, so all the agencies in the Corps are trying to appease her. Upon further discussion, Retief learns that d\u2019Land doesn\u2019t have a university for the exchange students to attend, just a technical college that would be overwhelmed to receive 200, much less 2,000, students. \n\nRetief also learns that all the exchange students are males, and their \u201cluggage\u201d is full of weapons. He diverts their luggage and sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy, where they help harvest the grapes. Retief is also sent to Lovenbroy for exceeding his authority. Hank tells Retief that he has won the prize for the picking competition. The prize is a girl named Delinda.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Retief is left in charge of his division while his superior, Magnan, is out of the office. After a farmer from the planet Lovenbroy tries to enlist his help with a labor shortage, Retief realizes a complex plot has been set into motion by the government of the planet Boge. The Bogans are sending two-thousand students to the planet D\u2019Land, except there\u2019s no school to accommodate them there and they\u2019re not actually students but soldiers. They\u2019ve also arranged to have weapons and war vehicles shipped under the guise of student baggage and tractors. Boge is using the financial leverage they have with the planet Croanie to get them to help with these shipments, and to ultimately allow the Bogans to take over Lovenbroy (a planet in debt to Lovenbroy that Boge has tried and failed to conquer in the past), D\u2019Land, and potentially another planet. After Retief uncovers how all of these plans and planets are connected, he moves to disrupt them. He reroutes the \u201cstudents\u201d to Lovenbroy to help with their grape harvest and allow them to get out of their debt to Croanie, and the war machines to D\u2019Land where they\u2019ll be out of Bogan hands. The end of the story finds Retief on Lovenbroy, where he has been sent because his superiors aren\u2019t happy that he meddled with the Bogan situation. Retief doesn\u2019t seem to mind his exile to Lovenbroy at all, as he has just won the grape harvest competition and met the beautiful woman who claims to be his prize. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\tAfter Second Secretary Magnan took his temporary leave of the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (AKA MUDDLE), Retief, his subordinate, is put in charge. Retief\u2019s first order of business is dealing with Hank Arapoulous who came to MUDDLE to ask for some help harvesting the Bacchus grapes. He shares that they are indebted to Croanie, who loaned them funds after a failed invasion from the Bogans. Arapoulous is worried that the Croanie\u2019s will be able to come in and harvest the grapes (as well as take the land) for themselves if they can\u2019t pay the debt since they hold the mortgage on some of the acreage. After sharing some wine (alternating between red and black), Retief agrees to try and see if he can send some helping hands to Lovenbroy, Arapoulous\u2019 home planet. \n\tRetief soon discovers that MEDDLE, another division at the Manpower Utilization Director, has authorized a shipment of 500 tractors that will be sent to Croanie. Retief questions Mr. Whaffle about it, and he explains that they are in need of heavy mining equipment. However, Croanie is mostly made up of fisheries, so there\u2019s nothing to mine there. Retief questions other shipments as well, including the authorized transport of 2,000 Bogan students to d\u2019Land. He discovers that there is only one technical college on d\u2019Land and that it would be overwhelmed with just 200 transfer students. As well, Boge and d\u2019Land have a very tense relationship; such a trade would be very rare. Sensing something fishy, Retief continues his search. \n\tOn his way to greet the incoming students, Retief stops at a bar and meets their teacher, Mr. Karsh. He describes training them as if they were in the military, not as if they were students. They leave together to meet the students. Retief arranged for a variety of fun events for the students, but Mr. Karsh shuts it all down. He simply wants to know when their luggage, flying in on a Croanie ship, will get in and when they will leave. \n\tQuickly, their plot falls apart as Retief researches these tractors and discovers they are machines built for war. After interrogating Mr. Whaffle about the shipment, he discovers that the tractors are going to Lovenbroy. He speaks to Mr. Gulver, a Bogan representative, who reveals that he just submitted an application for transportation for another 2,000 students. Retief then discovers the student\u2019s luggage was bound for Lovenbroy and filled with army-grade weaponry. Putting it all together, Retief sends the students to Lovenbroy without their weapons, hands Mr. Karsh off to Arapoulous for a frank talking to, and sends the tractors to d\u2019Land. The plan now thwarted, the students help harvest the Bacchus grapes. \n\tRetief was sent to Lovenbroy as punishment. He joins the harvest and ends up picking the most grapes of them all. His prize is a beautiful blonde woman. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Corps HQ is a diplomatic entity that houses a number of intergalactic departments, including the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (MUDDLE), which employs the story\u2019s protagonist, Retief. Retief reports to Second Secretary Magnan, who is taking some time off and asks Retief to manage affairs in his absence. He reminds Retief of a group of students from the planet Boge who will be traveling to the planet d\u2019Land as part of an Exchange Program. Magnan\u2019s hope is this program will help the warring Bogans better assimilate into the Galaxy\u2019s culture. While he is gone, Retief meets with a man named Hank Arapoulous, who represents a planet called Lovenbroy, known for its plentiful grape harvests. Over wine, Hank requests labor to harvest the crop essential to their livelihood on Lovenbroy, and Retief learns of their connection to a planet called Croanie. Several years ago, the farmers of Lovenbroy had to defend their mineral resources against their neighbors, and they lost a lot of money and men in the process. Therefore, they had to borrow money from Croanie, and Hank is afraid they won\u2019t be able to pay their debt on time without enough hands to harvest their grape crop. In addition, in their desperation, the farmers of Lovenbroy pawned the mortgage of their vineyards to Croanie thinking the twelve-year crop rotation would buy them enough time to pay back their debts. Retief says he will try to find a solution to his problem, and he sets about to attend the Intergroup Council and meet with the Bogan students set to depart for d\u2019Land. At the Council meeting, he learns Croanie is set to receive a shipment of mining equipment from the Corps, and the school on d\u2019Land set to receive the 2,000 Bogan students could hardly accommodate 200. At a bar later, Retief meets a man named Karsh, who drunkenly reveals he is training the students for something other than studying. At the library later, Retief learns that the tractors being sent to Croanie are not mining equipment, but are heavily armored with firepower. When Retief questions why so many tractors are being sent to a planet without the capacity to process them, he learns the excess will be sent to Boge. Retief deduces the entire situation is a Bogan plot to send troops to d\u2019Land and have Croanie provide the military equipment sourced from Corps grants. Instead, Retief has representatives from Armaments confiscate the students\u2019 luggage (which are actually filled with guns) and sends the \u201cstudents\u201d to Lovenbroy instead, where they help the farmers harvest their grape crop. Later, on Lovenbroy, Retief wins the grape-picking competition and celebrates with a local woman named Delinda, his prize for winning."

        "Summary_1": "The Bogans are people who have a history of aggression within the Nicodemean Cluster. In the last twenty years, they have launched four military campaigns against other Galaxy members; because of this, they are known as the Hoodlums of the Nicodemean Cluster. They have agreed to send 2,000 of their students to participate in the Exchange Program in d\u2019Land that the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education is facilitating. This agreement is a curiosity to Retief because d\u2019Land is a poor, industrial society, so he wonders what the Bogans will study there. His superior, Second Secretary Magnan, tells him that is none of his business and to be sure not to antagonize the Bogan representative. According to the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Underdeveloped Nations\u2019 General Economies (SCROUNGE) committeeman, every agency in the Corps is trying to appease Boge since Boge is a well-known troublemaker. He also informs Retief that d\u2019Land has no universities, just an under-endowed technical college that could not handle 200, much less 2,000, exchange students. He also tells Retief that most of d\u2019Land\u2019s problems result from an unwise trade agreement that it made with Boge.\n\n Retief meets Karsh, a Scoutmaster who trained the Bogan students; he made it like a game but says they know how to handle a CSU. As the Bogan students come through Customs and see Mr. Karsh, they snap to attention. Mr. Karsh refuses to let the students leave the airport. Retief notices that all the exchange students are males, and Karsh tells him they wanted to see how the first group of students was received before sending any females. Retief realizes that Bogan students are headed to a place that has no classrooms for the students. In the meantime, the tractors are being sent to Croanie, a world under obligation to Boge, and Croanie holds the mortgage to the best vineyards in Lovenbroy. Retief looks up the tractors that are being sent to Croanie and discovers they are armored vehicles with a half-megaton per second firepower. Retief learns that these continental siege units are ultimately being sent to Lovenbroy, which is rich in minerals, on behalf of Boge. Retief also learns that Boge has an application to send another 2,000 students to Croanie and is considering sending 2,000 more to Featherweight. Retief learns that Boge tried to take over Lovenbroy several years earlier and would have succeeded if not for bad luck. Retief calls a friend who works in transport and learns that the Bogan students\u2019 luggage is all being sent to Lovenbroy, and when he looked in the luggage, it was all weapons. Retief diverts the luggage and sends the students on to Lovenbroy to help with the grape harvest for the vineyards. He impounds the luggage full of weapons.\n\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Bogans are the people from the planet Boge. According to Retief\u2019s superior, they are known as the \u201choodlums\u201d of the nearby universe and have launched multiple military campaigns in the recent past. Despite this, no one seems to suspect the Bogans when they claim to be participating in a \u201ccultural exchange\u201d.  They plan to send \u201cstudents\u201d who are really intended to be soldiers and guns to D\u2019Land, a planet that loves peace but isn\u2019t on good terms with Boge. Another planet, Croanie, has fallen into debt to Boge and is facilitating a transshipment of \u201ctractors\u201d that are actually devices only useful for war or mining, making it seem like they might also be looking to take over Lovenbroy (which they tried, unsuccessfully, to do in the past, as well as another small nearby planet referenced in the story, Featherweight. Their plans are thwarted by Retief when he figures out what they are up to and reroutes the weaponry to D\u2019Land and the students to Lovenbroy. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\tThe Bogans are the people of Boge, a planet that lies in the same cluster as Lovenbroy and Croanie. The Bogans attempted to invade Lovenbroy ten years back, and, though they managed to fight for one year, they were eventually defeated. Their goal was to mine the land for the rich minerals that lay below the surface. \n\tAfter scheming with Croanie (who loaned money and resources to Lovenbroy post-war), the Bogans were able to develop a plan to finally invade Lovenbroy successfully. By using grants and a ploy of educating 2,000 of their students, the Bogans were almost able to ship 2,000 male soldiers to Lovenbroy with an array of weaponry in their duffel bags. The Bogans lied and said that they were sending these \u201cstudents\u201d to d\u2019Land to study there at the university. As well, Croanie aided them in acquiring 500 death tractors. These Bolo WV M-1s are incredibly dangerous tanks that can travel extremely fast and are outfitted with a bulldozer blade. Thanks to this added blade, they were able to market them as simply tractors, not the weapons of war they truly are. The tractors were on their way to Lovenbroy when Retief caught wind of their plan and stopped their shipment. He sent them to d\u2019Land instead, an enemy of the Bogans. \n\tRetief further destroyed their plan by sending the trained boys to Lovenbroy without their weaponry. He sent them to this beautiful planet so they could help Arapoulous in harvesting the Bacchus grapes. Fully thwarted and upset, Mr. Gulver, the Bogan representative, admits defeat and somehow escapes any true diplomatic punishment. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Bogans are a warring people from the planet Boge who have started four wars in the past twenty years throughout the galaxy. Because of their warlike tendencies, the Corps bends over backward to work with them to restore diplomacy to the galaxy. Boge has a trade agreement with the small, underpopulated planet of d\u2019Land, which they use to their advantage in hatching their plan to overtake them. They also have a hold over the planet of Croanie, which controls the vineyard mortgages on the planet of Lovenbroy. The Bogan representative, Mr. Gulver, manipulates the incompetent functions of the Corps to procure grants for 500 armored tractors to be sent to Croanie, which cannot process that amount. The plan is to send the excess to Boge. In addition, he has worked out an agreement with Second Secretary Magnan to send 2,000 students to d\u2019Land\u2019s technical college, which cannot accommodate that many students. Retief discovers that the students\u2019 luggage contains guns, and so he puts all the pieces together and discovers the Bogans\u2019 plan to overtake d\u2019Land rather than sublimate themselves. Retief sends the students to Lovenbroy to help harvest the grapes, and the guns are confiscated by representatives from the Armaments department."

They grow Bacchus vines, which only mature once every twelve years. This year is a harvest year, but they don\u2019t have enough people to harvest the grapes. Arapoulousis explains to Retief that a few years ago, Boge landed a force on Lovenbroy to try to mine their minerals by strip-mining. Lovenbroy fought back for a year but lost a lot of its men. This created financial problems, so Lovenbroy borrowed money from Croanie, mortgaging its crops. The loan is due, and the wine crop will cover the loan amount, but they don\u2019t have enough people to harvest the grapes. He is worried that if they don\u2019t have a great harvest, Croanie will come in and start mining. Also, if they default on the loan, Croanie will hold half of the grape acreage that they used to secure the loan. Arapoulousis has also asked for help from the Labor Office, but they only offered to send them machinery, and machines cannot harvest the grapes. He returns to see Retief the following day to find out if Retief has discovered a way to help. When Mr. Karsh makes a scene about the missing luggage for the exchange students, Retief has Arapoulousis take Karsh away and \u201ctake care of him.\u201d When they return, Karsh is stumbling and needs support to stand up. Arapoulousis explains that Karsh fell. \nRetief sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy with Arapoulousis to help with the harvest.

He is friendly, honest, and informal, though he is worried throughout most of the story about his people and his planet. He asks Retief for help getting labor to assist with Lovenbroy\u2019s grape harvest so they don\u2019t default on their debt to another planet, Croanie.

Although he hybridizes fruit as well for his job (apples the size of melons!), his love for his home planet comes first. He is a very stocky and sturdy man, around Retief\u2019s height. He is middle-aged, in his early 40s in Terrestrial years but only 28 in Lovenbroy years. He\u2019s a silver fox with gray hair and tan skin. \n\tArapoulous arrives at MUDDLE in need of help and assistance. The Bacchus wine, which he cultivates, has two varieties, red and black. The crop is only harvested every 12 years, but this year they have a shortage of harvesters. He asks Retief to send over some pickers since the other departments had already turned him down. \n\tArapoulous plays a very important role in this story as he introduces Retief to the diplomatic relations between Lovenbroy, Croanie, and the Borge. After explaining that the Lovenbroy are in debt to the Croanie (who came to their aid after a one-year war with the Boge), Retief soon realizes that a great plot is at hand. When all is discovered and Retief manages to thwart the Borge takeover of Lovenbroy, Arapoulous helps him interrogate and punish Karsh, the militaristic leader of the Borge boys. \n\tVictorious and proud, Arapoulous returns to Lovenbroy with 2,000 mighty helping hands. The Borge boys who were trained to take over Lovenbroy are now being used to harvest its mighty crop. Arapoulous is thrilled at the turn of events, especially since only hoped for 100 men, and is even more excited when he learns that Retief might be staying on Lovenbroy for a while. With his home safe from prying eyes and greedy hands, Arapoulous ends the story on a high note. \n",

Without the labor, they will not be able to pay back their debt to Croanie, the planet that owns the mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s vineyards. Hank tells Retief he is 28 years old, but later he learns Hank is closer to 42 because of the variation in the Terry years they use to track time on his planet. Hank is gregarious and passionate about the wine they produce, and he shares the red and black variations with Retief, who enjoys both. Retief agrees to help Hank, and during his inquiries, he discovers the Bogan plot to incite military action against d\u2019Land.

Lovenbroy is known for its exquisite wines produced from the Bacchus vines, which only mature once every twelve years. Lovenbroy is important for the Galaxy culture because, during the time when it is not raising and harvesting grapes and other crops, it makes important cultural contributions. They have created parks and farms and left sizable forests for hunting. They offer skiing, bob-sledding, and ice skating in the spring while it is still cold. They also create fine furniture, sculpture, and art. During the summer, they offer beach parties, drama, and symphonies. The land is full of minerals, which led Boge to land a force to strip-mine some of the resources. Lovenbroy fought back, but it took a year, and it lost many men. This has left Lovenbroy short-handed for this year\u2019s grape harvest. It also took a financial toll on Lovenbroy, and it had to borrow money from Croanie, mortgage its crops, and export its artwork. The loan is due during the harvest year, and without enough men to pick the grapes, Croanie will come in and take over half the vineyard land and mine it. Croanie is under obligation to Boge, and Boge is behind the scheme of sending \u201cexchange students\u201d supposedly to d\u2019Land but really to Lovenbroy to take its minerals. ",
        "Summary_2": "Lovenbroy is a small planet that depends on its grape crop and winemaking to sustain its economy. It is important to the story because a man from Lovenbroy asks Retief for help getting labor to harvest their grapes so they can pay their debts to Croanie. This interaction leads Retief to further investigate a series of events that has been set into motion wherein soldiers, weapons, and drilling equipment are being transported in disguise. In trying to right the wrongs that he discovers, Retief is also able to send two-thousand men to help with the harvest. Lovenbroy is also significant because it is where Retief is sent as punishment for his actions, though he doesn\u2019t seem to mind being stationed on the agreeable planet. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Lovenbroy is a beautiful, lush, and rich planet mostly made up of islands. It is the only place where Bacchus grapes can be grown, and its resources are highly coveted. Lovenbroy has five seasons throughout one Lovenbroy year (which is six months longer than a Terrestrial year). Their winters are long and harsh, with little to no sunlight all day long. This forced indoor time led to a very artistic culture springing up. Many spend the winters painting and sculpting. This necessary indoor time has made the Lovenbroy very keen on architecture. Spring is also pretty cold, but warm and light enough to woodwork and play a few sports. Then comes the season of music, where it rains all day but the sun constantly shines. The summer is incredibly hot, which forces people indoors again during the day, but able to play come the evening! Then it\u2019s autumn, which is harvest time for all crops, including the Bacchus grapes every 12 years. \n\tLovenbroy has many rich resources, most likely thanks to its mostly untouched landscape and erratic seasons. The land is ingrained with many minerals that have, so far, remained un-mined. Thanks to these minerals and metals in the soil, the trees (and then harvested timber) that are produced are colored differently. \n\tLovenbroy, being the home of so many invaluable resources, is fought for. A decade before the story began, Lovenbroy was invaded by the Boge who wanted to mine for minerals. After one year of war, the Lovenbroy managed to defeat the Boge, but it left them with a crippled economy and a depleted workforce. Croanie stepped in to help and gave them several loans. However, 10 years later, Lovenbroy is still in debt to Croanie. Harvesting the Bacchus grapes will give them enough revenue to pay off their loans, but they need more harvesters. \n\tLovenbroy is the main source of conflict in this story. Croanie and Boge work together to try and take over Lovenbroy and deplete the land of its resources. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Lovenbroy is a planet known for its vast vineyards of Bacchus vines used to produce delicious red and black wines. The vineyards cover mountains, stretch along riversides, and snake through beautiful gardens. Fertile grass springs up throughout the vineyards, and every twelve years, the entire population comes together to celebrate the crop and harvest the fruit together. Lovenbroy also has a rich source of minerals use to enrich their wine, and a few years ago one of their neighbors came to fight for control of these minerals. Lovenbroy ultimately won the battle, but they lost a lot of money and men in the fight, and they had to turn to the planet Croanie for financial assistance. Ultimately, they sold control of the mortgage on their vineyards to Croanie as well, thinking the twelve-year gap between harvests would be enough time to repay the debt. They were wrong, and they send a representative\u2014Hank Arapoulous\u2014to Corps HQ to seek additional labor to help pick the new harvest in time. This visit to Retief\u2019s office kickstarts the chain of events that lead to Retief\u2019s discovery of the Bogan plan to take military action against d\u2019Land."

        "Summary_1": "Croanie is a member of the Nicodemean Cluster of the Galaxy and is an associate of Boge, a member known to be a troublemaker. They tried to steal minerals from Lovenbroy earlier by attacking them. Croanie is under obligation to Boge. Croanie is the world that gave Lovenbroy a loan when it needed money to help tide it over until its next grape harvest. Croanie gave Lovenbroy a mortgage on its crops and holds a security interest in half of the grape acreage that it will acquire if Lovenbroy cannot meet the loan payment that is coming due. This is the reason that Hank Arapoulous goes to MEDDLE and asks for help obtaining workers to go to Lovenbroy and harvest the crop. It also turns out that Croanie is involved in Boge\u2019s efforts to attack Lovenbroy and gain access to its minerals. Mr. Whaffle reveals to Retief that Croanie is set to receive a shipment of heavy mining equipment, but Croanie is best known for its oceans and fishing and has no ore. In addition, when the Bogan exchange students arrive without their luggage, Mr. Karsh says their luggage is coming from Croanie. When their luggage does arrive, it is full of weapons. The \u201ctractors\u201d that are being shipped to Croanie are really armored vehicles that are continental siege units that carry four men and have a half-megaton/second firepower. Mr. Whaffle reveals that the tractors are for transshipment and that Croanie is in a difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise, with Boge. There is also an application for 2,000 more \u201cexchange students\u201d to be sent to Croanie.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Croanie is a planet that consists mostly of fisheries and is known for their seafood. They loaned another planet, Lovenbroy, some money when they were struggling, and the people of Croanie have also found themselves in debt to Boge, a nearby planet known as a local bully. Because of this, Croanie finds itself deeply entwined in Boge\u2019s web of interplanetary plots by transshipping siege units and/or mining equipment and letting Boge take advantage of their mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s best land. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Croanie is another planet that neighbors Lovenbroy and Boge. It is the home of many fisheries and seamen. Croanie has developed an alliance with the Bogans, who attempted to invade Lovenbroy ten years ago. When they failed, the Croanie swooped in and offered loans and assistance to the depleted and wounded Lovenbroy. \n\tLater on down the line, Croanie and the Bogans hatched a plot to take over Lovenbroy and mine their resources. The Croanie use grants and diplomatic immunity to acquire 500 Bolos, model WV M-1. These are essentially outfitted superpowered tanks that have a bulldozer blade attached (hence the ability to label them as tractors) to make demolition easier. Once Croanie acquired the \u201ctractors,\u201d Boge would send over 4,000 young Bogan boys to Lovenbroy who were trained and ready to invade. Together, their siege would completely overwhelm the Lovenbroy and destroy their home. \nThanks to Arapoulous coming to MUDDLE for help, Retief was able to piece together the random bits of the puzzle and thwart their plan. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Croanie is a mostly-aquatic planet known for its exports of seafood. They provide foot-long prawn to Lovenbroy.

A Croanie ship brings the luggage bearing the Bogans\u2019 weapons to meet the group of Bogan students who are set to fly to d\u2019Land to attend the Exchange Program. The students are actually soldiers, who will supposedly use the weapons to overtake d\u2019Land. They also are the recipients of a grant from the MEDDLE program that will supply them with 500 tractors\u2014an amount they cannot process with the facilities they have on their planet.

They are distraught over their son\u2019s attitude and attribute it to his age and the buildup of repressed impulses. Wayne views is parents with contempt. He reveals that he has been called to be drafted and leaves them to go to the authorities taking the family automobile.\n\nArriving at the Youth Center, Wayne navigates the bureaucracy of being drafted which involves registering and being issued with a firearm and a switchblade. He bristles against the military authority figures at the youth center, deriding their appearance and position. Wayne is cocky and confident even as he is warned about the dangers of his mission. Wayne is assigned a mission that involves killing a known murderer and his girl. He has six hours of autonomy where he is privileged to operate outside of the normal rule of law.\n\nWayne makes his way to a rougher neighborhood and witnesses another teenager hunt down and brutally murder a vagrant with a baseball bat. Wayne enters the bar which contains his target. He locates and engages them, shooting the man and chasing the woman out of the bar into a crumbling apartment building. When he eventually corners her, she begs him to kill her quickly. Wayne however is overcome with a physical aversion to the violence he was intending to commit.\n\nWayne is later being evaluated back at the Youth Center. It is revealed that society engages teenagers to execute criminals as a preferred outlet for their aggressive impulses. Those that go through with an execution are initiated into the military.

After checking in at the reception, he makes his way to the armory. He picks out a revolver, a shoulder hoster, and a switchblade disguised as a comb. His arrogance shows through his interactions with the many adults working at the Youth Center. They warn him of the trails he\u2019ll face, and he simply laughs them off. \nFinally, he heads to the elevator that will take him to Captain Jack, the commander of this facility. Seton\u2019s nervousness finally shows in his clammy palms and racing thoughts. Captain Jack intimidates him and questions his nerve and willingness to complete the mission. Captain Jack raises his bear-shaped cane to Seton, a blade sticking out the end of it. He tells Seton he has only six hours before the curfew sets back in. His target is at the Four Aces Club; a pretty woman with brightly colored clothes as well as a larger man, who\u2019d killed five people. \nSeton begins his hunt, driving around town and searching for them. He\u2019s pulled over by a cop trying to enforce the curfew, but one look at his pass card sends shivers down the officer\u2019s spine, and Seton is sent on his way. \nOnce he\u2019s arrived at the club, a bum grabs onto him and asks Seton to protect him.

Wayne takes the car that his parents were going to take for their night out, and heads toward the neon lights on the freeway. When he arrives at the Public Youth Center to check in for his draft call, he acts arrogantly to the sergeant at the reception desk. He heads to the armory to pick up two weapons: a Smith & Wesson .38, and a six-inch, spring-loaded Skelly switchblade. Afterwards, he heads to Captain Jack\u2019s office. Captain Jack is the first person Wayne encounters in the story who makes him nervous. The Captain gives Wayne permission to go without curfew or law for six hours, and assigns him a task: a \u201cbeast\u201d of a woman on the west side of town, at Four Aces Club, along with the man she is with. Wayne uses his signed pass to get past copy on his way there, driving through darker and darker streets, and  eventually makes it to the club. He ran into a drunk man who tried to ask Wayne for help, but some other teenagers pulled up a car, beat the man to death with a baseball bat, and split. Wayne disappeared into the club and caught eye of his targets. He was able to match the woman\u2019s description to the outfit Captain Jack said she would be wearing, and Wayne sits at a nearby table, watching the woman get nervous. He orders a drink; after he downs it, he gets up, and his targets try to run. He shoots the man before they all run out of the club, chasing each other through alleys and a building that was falling apart. He eventually cornered the woman in a pieced-together bedroom, and she begged him to kill her quickly. She is so tired of running from people sent to kill her that she would like it to be over as quickly as possible. Wayne pulls out his belt to whip her with, but after he swings it once, he starts to retreat. The woman still begs for him to kill her, but his attitude has completely shifted and he insists that he cannot, and runs away. When Wayne goes back to the Youth Center, the doctor in charge of \u201creadjustment\u201d of teenagers scolds Wayne for not killing the woman, both because he believes the two targeted people are terrible people, but also because that means Wayne did not get the violent energy out of his system. The team is sent to receive treatment and be sent back home, and Wayne realizes that these nights end like this more often than he had realized. ",
        "Summary_4": "Wayne listens at the top of the stairs as his parents discuss their concerns about him. Eva, his mother, worries that Wayne doesn\u2019t eat, and his father explains that he\u2019s only sixteen years old and he\u2019s waiting on his draft card. His father reminds Eva that Wayne\u2019s repressed impulses are not something they should be worrying about because the Youth Board takes care of those.\n\nWayne tells his parents that he just got his draft call, and he demands the car keys and leaves the house. He travels to the Youth Center. When he arrives, he chooses a gun and a knife for his weapons, and he meets up with Captain Jack. Captain Jack tells Wayne that he has one chance to prove himself, and he has six hours to complete his mission. Wayne needs to go to the Four Aces Club and murder two people who top the undesireable list. \n\nOutside of the club, he watches as a homeless person is beaten to death by a teenager. The bum calls out for help, but Wayne ignores his pleas.\n\nOnce he goes inside, he immediately recognizes his two targets, Red the psycho and a mousy girl. His gun fires accidentally, and the girl runs outside. Wayne chases her through dilapidated buildings and into her home where he sees the disgusting nest she sleeps in. Although he knows he is on a mission to bruise her and then kill her, and he has been asked to fulfill this duty, he cannot do it. He feels too badly for her. Even when she begs to be murdered so that she no longer has to live in fear of death, he refuses.\n\nWayne goes back to the Youth Center where Doctor Burns, the head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center, tells him that he needed to get his impulses out of the way in a controlled environment. Now, he can\u2019t be trusted not to hurt someone else since everyone has those impulses inside of themselves. Wayne is sent for treatment, and he realizes he is just like his father whom he despises. \n"

The story begins in a conventional domestic setting but quickly transitions to a Youth Center and then gritty underbelly of the city. The Youth Center is bureaucratic and clinical with Wayne making his way from registration to the Armory to his assignment. Later he returns to this center for psychological treatment. The inner-city area is known as Slumville and is filled with crumbling infrastructure and violent dealings. It is described as dark and mazelike with semi-abandoned buildings that are on the verge of collapse. The Four Aces Club where the main conflict of the story takes place is a seedy bar in Slumville where undesirables congregate. Smoky and filled with jazzy music, the club becomes a scene of tension and violence as Wayne confronts his targets there.",

A curfew is set in place, keeping in the acceptable people and allowing the undesirables to be hunted. As the main character continues to explore the city, we see more and more of its darkness.

        "Summary_3": "The story starts in the home of Wayne and his parents, which has at least two stories and is in the suburbs of some city. After a short drive on the freeway, Wayne arrives at the Public Youth Center where he navigates a series of rooms, first an armory with a wide variety of weapons, and then Captain Jack\u2019s office, which had its own sets of weapons, taxidermied animals, and menacing stone walls. After some more driving into town, Wayne heads into darker and darker streets that twist their way towards the club he was told his targets would be at. He parked his car in the alley across from the club, next to a large collection of garbage cans, where he encountered a homeless man. When he made it into the club, he found it to be very hazy and dark, even though it had been night outside already. He sat at his own table in the smoky environment for a while, until it was time to chase his targets. Once outside, the alley turned into a maze of other alleys, parking lots, ruined buildings, and other infrastructure that seems to be falling apart. He followed her up a crumbling staircase in a building that was barely standing, and eventually cornered her in a small room where she had made a makeshift bed to sleep on, created entirely from scraps of anything she could find, including paper and rags. After he left this building after not successfully killing his target, he finds himself back at the Youth Center where the story ends. ",

Once inside, he is served an alcoholic beverage even though he is only sixteen. \n\nIn his society, teenagers like Wayne are sent out into the streets to murder people who have committed crimes. The prevailing belief is that all humans have violent impulses inside of them, so allowing teenagers to murder legitimately terrible people will get rid of those impulses and allow for a peaceful society. In the past, the state was responsible for taking care of criminals, but at some point their way of dealing with violent offenders changed. Now, every child that turns sixteen is presented with a draft card. They must report to the local Youth Center, choose a weapon or two, and receive a target to eliminate. \n"

        "Summary_1": "Distinctive teenage or \u201cteener\u201d vernacular language is used extensively throughout the story. Wayne uses slang to communicate his dismissiveness of those in authority. People who live commonplace lives are \u201csquareheads\u201d and \u201cpunks\u201d. Some typical proper nouns are shortened \u201cOlds\u201d for Oldsmobile, \u201cCad\u201d for Cadillac. The effect is to cement the story in a future where language has evolved from its current state with teens communicating in a way that distinguishes them from other more conventional member of society. Wayne\u2019s interaction with the waiter is emblematic of this effect. By saying, \u201cBring me a Crusher,\u201d and then \u201cFade,\u201d it is signaled to the reader that Wayne views himself as a member of a select group with its own cant.",
        "Summary_2": "The author uses slang throughout the story as a way to designate actions/events that are unfamiliar and to fully immerse the reader. Although no clear definitions are given, the true meaning of the slang is discovered as the story unfolds. At first, the draft and make out are absolutely foreign terms. As the story continues, the reader learns that to make out is to take on the mission assigned to the youth by the Public Youth Center. These terms thrust the reader into the story and show how different this world is from ours.",
        "Summary_3": "Slang is the means by which the author denotes various categories of people throughout the story. In this world, people are categorized in large age groups. Wayne refers to people his parents\u2019 age as the Olds, and Wayne himself is referred to multiple times as a teener. This use of slang separates the world in the story from the world of the reader. It seems that Wayne likes to refer to things in casual ways, referring to the family car as a bolt bucket, and really takes the label of punk to heart when he is called that by Captain Jack. When Wayne arrives at the club where his targets are, the car that the other teenagers show up in is referred to as a Cad, presumably short for Cadillac. Another way language is used to delineate groups of people is in calling the hunted people beasts, and using animal imagery to describe them. The targets Wayne was after referred to as beasts, the woman as a mouse, and the man is a cat. This is one way these people are portrayed as less than human. Even during the chase, the woman is regularly referred to as a mouse, even as actual rats are running by as well. However, others are not entirely exempt from this use of animal imagery at the point of comparison, as Wayne is also compared to wild deer when he is chasing after the woman in the alley.",
        "Summary_4": "Slang words are used throughout the story, not only when Wayne is talking, but also when the narrator is explaining characters\u2019 actions. The specific word choices work to make the setting appear unique and mostly dreadful. \n\nWayne refers to his parents as \u201csquareheads\u201d as an insult. Wayne can\u2019t wait to distinguish himself from his parents. He finds them to be monotonous, overbearing, and lame. The slang term is meant to portray them in the light that Wayne sees them. They are not bad people, and they are deeply for their son. They\u2019re just normal, everyday parents, and Wayne wants a more adventurous life. \n\nIn a later scene, the narrator refers to a homeless person on the street as a \u201cstewbum\u201d. The word is definitely not a euphemism for alcoholic, and it doesn\u2019t make the character appear sympathetic. Instead, the use of the term stewbum suggests that he is inferior and is almost deserving of the violence he faces from a seemingly random teenager. \n\nIn the text, teenagers are referred to as \u201cteeners\u201d. Since teenagers have a very important role in this society, and it\u2019s definitely a rite of passage to fulfill the violent mission and purge the criminal that they\u2019ve been assigned to, this slang term makes teenagers seem like a separate class of people. Their ability or inability to make good on their draft card will change the course of their lives, so it\u2019s fitting that they are given a different name.\n\n"

He slung the holster under his left\narmpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the\nway the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket\nback on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the\nelevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with\nstuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain\nJack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had\na head shaped like a grinning bear.\n  \n \n  Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to\nshrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea\namong bowling balls.\n  \n \n  Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy\nhead. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\n  \n \n  \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something\nin a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?\nReally going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.\nHis legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear\nthe way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll\nshow you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until\nhe screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,\nran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But\nthat wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,\nwhat was he doing holding down a desk?\n  \n \n  \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly\ncollection.\"\n  \n \n  The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch\nfrom Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped\na knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n  \n \n  Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his\npasscard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make\nout.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West\nSide. Know where that is, punk?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow\nslacks and a red shirt.

They got to go and\nthey're your key to the stars.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\n  \n \n  \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack.\n  \n<doc-sep>He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and\nstood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and\nyellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.\nThe eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red\nslash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for\nrunning, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near\nher, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\n  \n \n  She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude\nof being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a\nweirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\n  \n \n  Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty\nT-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse\nheavy.\n  \n \n  \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\n  \n \n  \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\n  \n \n  \"Sure, teener.\"\n  \n \n  Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and\nfed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She\nsat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\n  \n \n  Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons\nimbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one\nside. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious\ncat's.\n  \n \n  Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at\nhis lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated\non staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright\nbut dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little\nmouse.\n  \n \n  The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in\nthe pay of the state.\n  \n \n  \"What else, teener?\"\n  \n \n  \"One thing. Fade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\n  \n \n  Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his\nveins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\n  \n \n  He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped\nfast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the\nair. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the\nwhite eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her\nthroat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\n  \n \n  \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\n  \n \n  He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table\ncrashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast\nfilled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door\nholding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was\nout the door.\n  \n \n  Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the\ncold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted\ndown the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\n  \n \n  He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and\nthen, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the\nlife-or-death animation of a wild deer.\n  \n \n  Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.\nThrough shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,\nsliding down a brick shute.\n  \n \n  He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her\nscream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood.\n  \n<doc-sep>A copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright\nrespectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\n  \n \n  Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's\nquivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The\nOlds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away.\n  \n \n  The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from\nSlumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind.\nHe turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale,\nsecretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted\npotholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.\nWayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath\nthrough the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with\nthe shadows of mysterious promise.\n  \n \n  He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously\ninto it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as\nhe spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling.\n  \n \n \n   FOUR ACES CLUB\n   \n \n \n  He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging\nthe sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass\nfiltering through windows painted black.\n  \n \n  He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of\na bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked\nshirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub\nbalanced on one end.\n  \n \n  The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had\na dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a\ngrotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and\ndoom.\n  \n \n  \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\"\n  \n \n  Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled.\n  \n \n  The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons.\n  \n \n  \"Help me, kid.\"\n  \n \n  He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast\nof headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed\npast Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires\nsquealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and\ncrouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n  \n \n  \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand\ncame up swinging a baseball bat.\n  \n \n  A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n  \n \n  The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The\nteener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air\nas the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n  \n \n  Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder\nat finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew\nand no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything.\nLiving seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,\nuntil something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He\nheld his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in\nspirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting\nlicense and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n  \n \n  The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener\nlaughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell\nclogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth\nstill open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled\nup with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n  \n \n  The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down\nwith his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the\nCad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling\nglass.\n  \n \n  \"Go, man!\"\n  \n \n  The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it\nbounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like\nbright wind-blown sparks.\n  \n \n  Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in\nscummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made\nhis heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n  \n \n  He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and\npursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Wayne is a cocky, arrogant sixteen-year-old defined by his lack of respect for authority. His main goal in life is to be drafted into the military and lead an adventuring life.\n\nHis unnamed parents care for their son but are nonplussed by his attitude and general demeanor of rebelliousness. They seem to live commonplace lives with domestic trips to the movie theatre or a neighborhood poker game. Wayne views this type of life as detestable. His interaction with his parents is crude and condescending.\n\nThe military officials that Wayne meets in the Youth Center also elicit Wayne\u2019s contempt. He views their desk jobs as an analog to his parents\u2019 \u201cpunkie\u201d existence. To Wayne, the only admirable way of life is one of high adventure. He disrespects most of the desk workers, but the commanding officer, Captain Jack, deflates his self-assurance.\n\nWayne is keenly intent on hunting his targets. He stares them down tensely before violently engaging them. female target, nicknamed the \u201cmouse\u201d, is revealed to be a woman without hope. She\u2019s tired of running and just wants to be put out of her misery. Surprisingly, at the moment of truth, Wayne cannot bring himself to execute the woman in cold blood, in his own words, \u201cpunking out\u201d. He admits to the doctor analyzing him after his assignment that he felt sorry for her.     \n",
        "Summary_2": "In the beginning, Wayne Seton\u2019s interactions are marked by his arrogance, ego, and desire to hunt. He treats his parents as one would children. He over-analyzes their behavior, and, instead of feeling pity for them, he finds them annoying and useless. He\u2019s desperate to break free of this house and this planet. He views himself highly and dreams about his future on Mars or other such grand adventures. \nHis behavior doesn\u2019t change when Seton finally arrives at the Youth Center. He continues to treat the officers with disrespect, although, as he meets with Captain Jack, he begins to become scared. \nHis desire to hunt and break free of his family drives him, as well as his belief that he is beyond all of this. He watches the other men kill the bum with awe and glee. It doesn\u2019t disgust him, rather it interests him. \nHowever, when it comes time to kill his own undesirable, he finds himself unable. He begins to feel pity, empathy, and sympathy. These emotions make it impossible for him to complete his mission. Although he tries to use his arrogance to hype himself up, he ends up admitting that he doesn\u2019t want to kill the woman and runs away. All bark, but no bite.\n",
        "Summary_3": "In the first half of the story, Wayne is very cocky in his interactions with other people. He clearly has no respect for his parents, thinks they lack intelligence, and is annoyed with their routines. He felt he could explode at any moment, so being cold and short with them when they had to interact with them is his way of keeping them out of the line of fire of his impulses. He insists on taking the family car, and is still high and mighty when he gets to the Public Youth Center, throwing sass at the sergeant at the reception desk as well as the corporal in the armory. It is only when he meets Captain Jack that he starts to show some humility and nervousness. His hands start to sweat, and the captain calls him a punk a number of times and then startles him, almost whacking Wayne with his cane. Once he gets to the club, Wayne is nervous interacting with the homeless alcoholic who encountering the alley, and is terrified by the other teenagers who arrived to kill this man. After he retreats into the club, Wayne finds a sense of superiority again as he flashes his official documents to be able to order a drink, after he spots his targets. His goal is to make them as uncomfortable as possible, so he sits right near them, and enjoys the opportunity to have a drink on the government\u2019s dime. After he decides to pursue his targets, he shoots the man once before both targets and Wayne make their way outside. Wayne taunts the woman as he chases her through the alley and the dilapidated buildings, and threatens her with what he intends to do to her once he has her cornered. Once he actually strikes her with his belt though, he retreats into himself and is very nervous all of a sudden, and runs away from the woman. He felt sorry for her, and told this to the doctor at the Youth Center as he is scolded. Wayne seems ashamed, apologizes for punking out, and quietly does what he is told by the doctor for the rest of the session.",
        "Summary_4": "Wayne looks down on the other characters in the story, including his own mother and father. He refers to them as squareheads, and he actually finds his mother\u2019s distress and her arguments with his father to be funny. In a brief scene where Wayne demands the car keys from his parents, it\u2019s clear that they are fearful of him. Instead of thanking them for allowing him to use the car, he repays them for their generosity by laughing at them and slamming the door in his mother\u2019s face. Wayne is fully aware that his mother is terrified of his draft call, and he does not allow her to hug him or give him words of encouragement or advice before he leaves the house. \n\nWhen he arrives at the Youth Center, he treats the man at the front desk poorly, and then proceeds to make fun of the corporal who tries to give him advice. Wayne has a bad attitude, and it affects his interactions with everyone. \n\nThe only person that Wayne does not feel like he can treat badly is Captain Jack. Captain Jack is in a serious position of authority, and that makes Wayne nervous. He answers his questions politely. \n\nIt is truly shocking when Wayne is unable to kill the mousy woman that he was assigned to purge. He has her cornered in an abandoned and run-down building, but he can\u2019t go through with the violence, no matter how much he wants to. In the meeting that takes place afterwards, he tells the doctor that he felt bad for the woman. Therefore, Wayne does have a conscience, even if he likes to pretend that he does not. \n"

He slung the holster under his left\narmpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the\nway the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket\nback on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the\nelevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with\nstuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain\nJack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor.

        "Summary_1": "The expository dialogue by Doctor Burns at the end of the story provides some insight into how this society views the tendency toward violence in its citizens and retributive criminal justice. The prevailing understanding is that adolescents (presumably adolescent men) are subjected to aggressive and violent impulses. The society seeks to provide these teens a preferred outlet for these impulses in the form of a violent act in service of the state. Typical this seems to be the execution of an undesirable member of society who is viewed as beyond redemption. This permitted brutality is thought to get it out of a teen\u2019s system and prepare him for a life as a contributing member in the state\u2019s military apparatus. The result of this situation is a dramatically violent society where untrained youths are recruited to act as vicious vigilantes who terrorize anyone labelled as undesirable. ",
        "Summary_2": " In the final passages of the story, Wayne Seton, the protagonist, sees a doctor after his failed attempt to eliminate two alleged criminals. Despite feeling the spark and need to hunt and kill earlier, when faced with a scared young woman, he was unable to complete his task. \nDoctor Burns, a member of the readjustment staff at the center where Seton was drafted, takes a look over Seton after he returned. Although Seton enjoyed the thrill of the chase, his empathy and sympathy got the better of him. \nAfter examining him, Dr. Burns reveals the reason why Seton was sent on this mission in the first place. In this abstract reality, those who have committed heinous crimes (in this case, paternal murder and multiple homicides) are labeled as unwanted and unable to change. Instead of sending them to prison for their crimes where they may spend the rest of their lives or receive the death penalty, they send young adults out to hunt them down. \nAt 16 years old, school ends for the teenagers in this society. Once school is over, all the young adults must wait for their draft to come in. \nThey believe that each person is born with a dangerous impulse to kill. If it can be expelled at a young age and used on a person who deserves it, then there\u2019s no risk of a violent crime later on. \nThe justice system is executed by everyday people, instead of a team of soldiers or the government. \nAs well, if the 16-year-olds complete their mission, they will be shot off to space and continue their work in the galaxy.\n",
        "Summary_3": "In this society, instead of imposing penalties like death row, the government uses teenagers to end the lives of the people the society has deemed the biggest criminals. Part of this is an attempt to acknowledge the violent impulses that they expect teenagers to have, so this program is meant to give teenagers an outlet to expend this energy in hopes of getting rid of it entirely. Violent tendencies are clearly expected of everyone, as part of a more primitive instinct of sorts. The two people that Wayne was given as targets both killed people outside of this designated time, and so society decided they had to die. There is this tension between government sanctioned murder and other murder. This opportunity for teenagers to address their aggression also serves as a sort of test, and their ability to successfully eliminate their targets determines their future in some way. Formally, this means that the teenagers are given their own choice of weapons, and a six-hour pass to do whatever they want, including breaking curfew and any other laws. However, what happens to them going forward depends on the success of killing their targets in the six hours.",
        "Summary_4": "When the children in this society turn sixteen, they are forced to take a draft call. They must go to a local Youth Center and take orders from an established captain. The kids choose the weapons they would like to use, and they head out to take down a dangerous individual or multiple individuals. When Wayne is stopped by a cop at the beginning of his mission, all he has to do is show the police officer the card he has, and he\u2019s free to continue on into the darkness. This means that his mission is sanctioned by the state. \n\nAfter Wayne fails to commit the beatings and murders that he\u2019s been assigned, he must receive some sort of treatment from a doctor. The thinking is that all people are born with impulses to commit violence, and those that cannot bring themselves to do it in a state sanctioned way are now in danger of hurting people that do not deserve it. The society asks the teenagers to kill the criminals because they believe it fulfills two necessities at once. Dangerous people are expelled from society, and adolescents can be trusted not to turn into violent individuals because they have already gotten it out of their systems.  \n"

It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\non the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\nEnglish, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n  \n \n  \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\nkid's dog have?

Don't\u2014Go back!\" The horrible,\nmindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\nHis insides writhed to thrust it out.\n  \n \n  She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\nfloor.\n  \n \n  The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\nit back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\nfingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\nthe room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What do you\n   \n   do\n   \n  ?\" Steffens asked.\n  \n \n  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n  \n \n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n  \n",

Marnagan states that they could walk the entire diameter of the planet they are on in four hours, but Hathaway points out that he has only an hour of oxygen.  Hathaway states that he has photo evidence that the meteor that hit their ship was thrown at them, probably by Gunther, the person Marnagan is trying to capture, but Marnagan redirects their priorities to oxygen, food, and a way back to earth.\n\nAs they walk in search of help, they notice that there is human-made gravity on the planet.  Immediately after making that discovery, they encounter an enormous herd of dangerous beasts.  When Marnagan discovers his gun is ineffective as a weapon, they flee to a nearby cave for protection, as the cave is too small for the beasts to enter.\n\nMarnagan asks Hathaway to take a picture of him with the beasts.  Hathaway snaps several pictures of Marnagan posing at a safe distance.  Hathaway then says that between the \u201cnatural\u201d meteors, gravity, and beasts, their crash will look accidental rather than like murder.  He shows Marnagan the pictures he shot, intending to use the beasts as part of his argument, but Marnagan protests that his film is \u201clousy\u201d as only Marnagan, appears in the shots and not the beasts.  When Hathaway confirms this is so, he is insistent that the film cannot lie.  If the beasts do not appear in the photos, they don\u2019t exist.\n\nWhen they emerge from the cave and the animals are gone, the men are at first elated.  Hathaway quickly realizes, though, that with their oxygen running low and limiting the time they have to find Gunther\u2019s base and fresh oxygen, they must get the beasts to return so that they can follow the beasts to their source--Gunther\u2019s base.\n\nThe men concentrate on the beasts and the beasts reappear; Hathaway and Marnagan locate a source point and head toward it.  Marnagan believes he is being attacked by a beast, but when Hathaway reminds him the monsters are fake, Marnagan is able to resist the telepathic message.  Marnagan enters the cave where it appears the animals are coming from and finds an air-lock door and a tunnel before he is captured by a guard.  He tells the guard his partner is dead.\n\nHathaway creeps in through the air-lock door to see Marnagan held at gunpoint.  Hathaway fools the guard into believing he is armed, takes his gun, and gets the guard to guide him and Marnagan to oxygen.  They then use photos of Marnagan, inserted in the telepath machines, to take over Gunther\u2019s fortress and capture him.  The story ends with Hathaway taking a triumphant posed picture of Marnagan.",

Marnagan is an Interplanetary Patrolman from Luna Base who hired Hathaway to travel with him and film the pirate's capture. He wants to use the film footage to teach Junior Patrolmen how to get out of difficult situations. While Hathaway is filming, a meteor strikes their spaceship, knocking it down to an asteroid. The ship splits open, so there is no way for them to leave the asteroid. They both have 60 minutes of oxygen remaining. At first, they think the meteor was an accident, but then Hathaway remembers that it was red-hot and glowing before it struck them, and he knows that meteors in space are never glowing hot. Hathaway is convinced that Gunther lobbed the meteor at them to make them crash. As they begin walking on the surface of the meteor, they notice a change in the gravity in one place and realize that they have stumbled upon Gunther\u2019s hideout. Then a horde of monsters comes charging at them, making Hathaway and Marnagan run for their lives and hide in a small cave. Marnagan fires his gun at the beasts, but it does not affect them.\n\nMarnagan has Hathaway film him facing the beasts. Hathaway has invented a film that develops itself when exposed to light. He pulls the film out of his camera for them to view, and both are surprised to find that the monsters are not on it. Hathaway thinks that the monsters are not real since they do not show up on the film. He believes they have just been tricked into thinking they are real. Marnagan agrees and decides to walk out among the monsters. When he does, the monsters disappear. Hathaway says that the monsters are still dangerous because as long as people think they are real, they might be frightened to death or commit suicide to avoid being caught by them. He also concludes that if they believe the monsters are real, they will return. \n\nBoth men say they believe in the monsters to draw them out again so that they can see where they come from. They find the opening to the hideout, and Marnagan goes in first since he has a gun, but a guard catches him. Hathaway hears the guard over the audio system and sneaks up on the guard and threatens him to make him throw down his weapon. Marnagan and Hathaway find the telepathic station from which the images of the monsters are sent. Hathaway feeds his film into the telepathic station. When he confronts Gunther, the telepathic station shows an image of 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen marching toward them, but it\u2019s really just Marnagan and 499 images of him. The guards run away as Hathaway films them. Since the film won\u2019t record the telepathic images, it will look like Marnagan singlehandedly fought off all of Gunther\u2019s guards.\n",

Their ship is struck by meteors and lands on an asteroid, where they begin to realize they are being manipulated by someone, most likely Gunther himself. They notice that someone has created a \u201csuper-gravity\u201d setup that pulled their ship down, and after being chased into a cave by monstrous beasts they realize via Hathaway\u2019s self-developing film that the creatures only exist in their minds. Once they figure this out they are able to follow the monsters to their source: Gunther\u2019s fortress inside the asteroid. \n\nMarnagan enters first and is caught by a guard, and tells the guard that his partner is already dead while Hathaway sneaks in. They capture and truss up the guard and replace their oxygen tanks before heading into the fortress proper. They piece together how Gunther has been pulling in ships (including their own) to steal their cargo, and using the telepathic creatures to scare off tourists and inadvertent travelers. They find the machine used to create the creatures and concoct a plan. \n\nHathaway walks toward what he presumes to be Gunther\u2019s residence and allows himself to be captured. He is brought to Gunther, who calls his bluff when Hathaway tells him that patrols have arrived. They hear screams from the plaza and look out to see a line of five-hundred patrolmen. Gunther orders his troops to hold the patrolmen back and they stay to fight, but are vastly outnumbered and easily defeated by the patrolmen. During the battle, Gunther starts shooting a pistol wildly and Hathaway knocks him out with a paperweight before Marnagan enters the building. \n\nWe learn that the line of patrolmen was made up of duplicates of Marnagan created by the telepathic sending station that created the monsters.

        "Summary_4": "Interplanetary Patrolman Irish Marnagan and photographer Click Hathaway are on a mission to apprehend a space pirate named Gunther, when a meteor hits their ship, and they crash-land. Marnagan had hired Click to document his capture of Gunther as an educational video for Junior Patrolmen. Click realizes they have an hour left in their oxygen supplies, so they set about to find food, air, and a way to return to Earth. Click suspects the crash was engineered by Gunther himself. As they walk along the meteor, they begin to realize gravity behaves strangely there, and Click wonders if that, too, has been engineered by Gunther. Before he can think on this too deeply, they encounter a horde of monsters of all shapes and sizes coming for them over a hill. Marnagan shoots at them, but they are immune to his shots. Marnagan and Click hide in a nearby cave to hatch a plan. Marnagan poses for some pictures pretending to battle the monsters. Click posits a theory that the strange gravity and meteor attack they\u2019d encountered earlier was Gunther\u2019s way of crashing ships on his asteroid\u2014an effective weapon in an age with primitive space-battle weaponry and a good way to gather supplies while being short on crew. The monsters had been sent to finish the job. When they sit down to examine Click\u2019s footage, they see that there are no monsters in any of the shots. This leads Click to develop another theory\u2014if the monsters weren\u2019t really there, then neither were they! Marnagan tests his theory by walking out of the cave into the middle of the monsters. Because he believes they do not exist, they vanish completely, and the two men realize Gunther\u2019s plan to scare to death anyone who might happen upon his asteroid. At the same time, they are running out of oxygen, and Click says they must bring the monsters back in order to follow them back to Gunther\u2019s base. They bring them back by believing in them, but protect themselves by not being afraid of them. They fight their way through the fake monsters until Marnagan discovers a door leading to a tunnel, and he drops into it. A guard stops Marnagan, and Click uses his camera as a fake weapon to trick the guard into dropping his weapon. After procuring oxygen tanks, Click and Marnagan discover the telepathic sending station from which Gunther transmitted the monster images to ward off visitors. Click has the idea to use this technology to their advantage and trick Gunther and his men into believing the entire Patrol has come to the asteroid. Marnagan stays behind to imitate the 500-man Patrol, while Click goes to Gunther\u2019s hideout to film the fake Patrol\u2019s attack. Marnagan\u2019s fake Patrol defeats Gunther\u2019s men, Click disables Gunther, and Marnagan realizes that Click\u2019s film portrays him as a hero (the film did not capture the telepathically-induced Patrol\u2014only Marnagan storming their ranks). Marnagan gets his educational video, and Click gets his news headline."

There were about six streets,\nlined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a\nwide, green-lawned Plaza.\n  \n \n  Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked\nacross the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that\nwas pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.\n  \n \n  He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.\n  \n \n  He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and\npushed him into a room where Gunther sat.\n  \n \n  Hathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The\npirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,\nquestioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of\nmetal-link cloth.

Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\"\n  \n \n  Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway\nhad to credit them on that. They took it, standing.\n  \n \n  Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.\nHis camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him\nfrom filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was\nthrowing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his\nfragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.\n  \n \n  Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three\nof the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and\ntwitch. God, what photography!\n  \n \n  Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He\nfired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.\nThen Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos\ntaking place immediately outside his window.\n  \n \n  The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And\nout of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Click shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\na spool popped out onto his gloved palm.

This film allows Hathaway and Marnagan, the active partner on the mission, to view Hathaway\u2019s pictures immediately and notice the absence of beasts from Hathaway\u2019s pictures.  This allows for the revelation that the beasts are telepathic projections into the men\u2019s minds and sets up the final \u201cbattle\u201d in the story, in which telepathic projections of Marnagan, created by the same projectors that created the beasts, along with photos from Hathaway\u2019s film, defeat Gunther\u2019s guards and enable Hathaway and Marnagan to capture Gunther.

Later, when a guard has Marnagan, Hathaway holds his camera out like a weapon to make the guard drop his gun. Hathaway\u2019s profession also helps him think of a way to use the telepathic station against Gunther\u2019s guards when he films Marnagan in various movements and then feeds his film into the machine to become thought emanations.

Nobody'll ever see it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while\nwaitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our\nrescue!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway snorted. \"U.S. Cavalry.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he\nsaid. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,\nmy capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace\nnegotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver\nfor nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running\naround in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but\nhis mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of\nMarnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.\n  \n \n  Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\nfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without\nmuch effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death\nwall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying\nanything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they\nhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n  \n \n  When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\nup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n  \n \n  \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\nback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\nwhat's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\nwar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\nis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which\ndispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\nSuper-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\nIt's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\nunseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan rumbled. \"Where is the dirty son, then!\"\n  \n \n  \"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent\u2014them.\" Hathaway nodded at\nthe beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from\nwounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that\u2014the animals\ntend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle\nhis attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the\nPatrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,\nthen.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't see no Base around.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Click shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\na spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped\nit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it\ndeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing\nfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,\nleaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the\nimpressions. Quick stuff.\n  \n \n  Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,\nClick handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah,\nClick. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\"\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid\nmonsters complete.\"\n  \n \n  \"What!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:\nPictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally\nwith\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ; Marnagan shooting his gun at\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ; Marnagan\npretending to be happy in front of\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Then, closeup\u2014of\u2014NOTHING!\n  \n \n  The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair\nlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.\nMaybe\u2014\n  \n \n  Hathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this\nmess! Here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,\nthe beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the\nmonsters weren't there, they weren't there.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click.\n  \n \n  Marnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or\ninfra-red or something that won't come out on film?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nuts!

        "Summary_1": "Despite their clear differences, Hathaway and Marnagan are a solid team who work well together and depend on each other.  We first see this in the opening scene of the story where Hathaway is physically clinging to Marnagan in his distress during the crash sequence.  After the crash, Hathaway is more concerned with taking photos of Marnagan emerging from the crash than helping him emerge from the rubble, not because he doesn\u2019t care about his companion, but because he sees his companion as so strong, it doesn\u2019t occur to him to be concerned for his physical safety.  This points to one of their key differences--while Marnagan is immediately concerned for Hathaway\u2019s safety and assumes Hathaway would reciprocate, Hathaway sees Marnagan as much stronger than himself, nearly invulnerable.\n\nWe see Hathaway and Marnagan\u2019s collaborative relationship continue when they are faced with the beasts.  They are both afraid; Hathaway is the first to spot the secure hiding place of the cave and hails Marnagan to run there.  Marnagan then proposes that he pose \u201cwith\u201d the beasts--standing at a safe distance with them in the background--and Hathaway agrees.  They continue to argue about what to do while Hathaway develops the film as part of his argument.  When Hathaway presents the developed film as evidence, Marnagan teases him about his invention being \u201clousy\u201d, as only he (Marnagan) shows in the photos, but the monsters do not.  This joke sets up Hathaway\u2019s realization that the beasts are telepathic projections rather than physical beings, leading the men to debate which of them will lead the hunt for oxygen.  While Hathaway knows his partner is physically stronger and he is already suffering from oxygen deprivation, he doesn\u2019t want to risk Marnagan\u2019s safety if his deduction proves wrong.  Marnagan, however, shows his trust in Hathaway by insisting that he (Marnagan) lead, confident that if Hathaway says the monsters aren\u2019t there, they are indeed not.\n\nWhen Marnagan briefly succumbs to the telepathic illusion of the beasts, Hathaway is able to talk him down.  Just by listening to Hathaway\u2019s words, Marnagan is able to convince himself again that the beasts are not real.  Marnagan then convinces the guard he encounters that Hathaway died in the ship crash, allowing Hathaway to sneak in, capture the guard, and get both the men oxygen.  They use their teamwork in a last instance to defeat the principal antagonist of the story, Gunther.  Hathaway is captured by more of Gunther\u2019s guards and taken to him, but is already prepared.  He shows Gunther that Gunther\u2019s men are being overwhelmed and defeated by five hundred armed Patrol men, causing Gunther to pull out a weapon and fire wildly until Hathaway knocks him unconscious.  We then are told that the \u201cfive hundred Patrol men\u201d are telepathic illusions of Marnagan projected by the same projectors that created the images of the beasts, supplied with photos of Marnagan shot by Hathaway.  Once again their teamwork proves crucial to the success of the mission.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Marnagan hired Hathaway to film his search for the elusive pirate Gunther. Marnagan plans to use the film to train Junior Patrolmen how to get out of a difficult situation. The two men are also friends who joke with each other. When Marnagan points out that he could have been killed in the crash, Hathaway frowns and turns pale. When Hathaway first speculates that Gunther caused the meteor to hit their spaceship, Marnagan isn\u2019t convinced that is true, but as they begin making discoveries about the asteroid\u2019s gravity and monsters, Marnagan trusts Hathaway\u2019s theories enough to leave the cave and walk among the monsters. When Marnagan returns unscathed, Hathaway breaks down in tears of relief to see that he is safe. Later, when a guard is holding Marnagan at gunpoint, Hathaway risks his life to save Marnagan by using his camera as a pretend weapon to take the guard\u2019s weapon. He then forces the guard to drag Marnagan, unconscious from lack of oxygen, to get a replacement oxygen tank. The two men also compliment each other when they defeat Gunther and his men.",
        "Summary_3": "At the beginning of the story, Hathaway and Marnagan are colleagues; Marnagan has hired Hathaway to document his mission to hunt down Gunther. As the story goes on, they become very dependent on one another in order to survive. They both try to put themselves in harm\u2019s way in order to protect the other (Hathaway wanting to leave the cave first in case the monsters are real, Marnagan telling the guard that the monsters already killed his partner, etc.) multiple times and value the contributions the other makes to their plans. The events of the story bring them much closer, and they effectively save each other\u2019s lives. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Marnagan has contracted Click Hathaway\u2019s talents as a photographer and filmmaker to help him produce a video he can use to train the Junior Patrolmen how to handle difficult situations they may face. Together, they seek out Gunther the space pirate and Click documents the journey. Their relationship is mutually beneficial\u2014Marnagan is the brawn, and Click is the brain. They work together to escape the monsters, and, ultimately, to defeat Gunther and his men and procure the footage both of them want for their individual purposes. Throughout the story, both characters engage in witty retorts to one another, but they always show each other respect and a commitment to get through the trying ordeal to survive."

        "Summary_1": "The crash of Hathaway and Marnagan\u2019s ship is the precipitating event for the events that follow, but it is also more than that.  Hathaway states shortly after the crash that the meteor that hit their ship was deliberately aimed at them with force, based on it being \u201chot and glowing\u201d at the time of the collision.  Hathaway hypothesizes at that time that Gunther, the man Marnagan is trying to capture on their mission, had engineered the crash.  A short time later, when walking along the surface of the planet, Hathaway notices sudden weight loss.  After he and Marnagan test it and confirm that it really happened, they conclude that their ship was not only hit by a meteor, it was dragged down to the planet by an unnatural amount of gravity, more than the planet is generating.  They then meet horrifying, dangerous monsters, but these are revealed in short order to be telepathic projections.  They are able to dispel the images of the monsters by their own belief that the monsters are not really there, then summon them back by imagining that they are there, but that the monsters cannot harm them.  In this way, the monsters lead them to Gunther, who is captured when Marnagan and Hathaway use the telepathic projectors that generated the \u201cmonster\u201d images to generate hundreds of images of Marnagan, making it appear that there is an army ready to take over Gunther\u2019s base and capture or kill all his men.  All of this flows from the initial crash engineered by Gunther with the propelled meteor and the area of super-gravity that pulled the ship down to the planet.  Gunther hoped to make the ship disappear and Marnagan and Hathaway along with it.  Instead, they crashed on the single planet where they could find him and had to take on an immediate quest to search for him in order to survive, as they had limited oxygen and needed to find the only other humans on the planet in order to replenish their supply.",
        "Summary_2": "The crash in the opening scene sets up the conflict with Gunther in the climax of the story. Gunther is responsible for the meteor that strikes the spaceship and makes it crash on the asteroid. He is also responsible for the monsters that first terrify Hathaway and Marnagan and that later lead the men to his hideout inside the asteroid. Hathaway speculates that Gunther crashes or pulls ships onto his asteroid. Gunther is short on men, and space weapons are inaccurate, so he uses super-gravity to crash the ships. The people die from a lack of air or food or their injuries from the crash. Since there are no signs of weapons, if the Patrol ever shows up, it looks like the people died of accidental deaths rather than murder. The crash makes it possible for Marnagan to finally reach Gunter, a space pirate that no one has ever seen before.",
        "Summary_3": "The crash of Hathaway\u2019s and Marnagan\u2019s ship in the opening scene of the story is significant both because it brings them to the asteroid where Gunther is hiding, and because it helps them figure out how Gunther is stealing cargo. Their ship is brought down at great speed by meteorites that Gunther and his troops launch at it, and then pulled in by a super-gravity situation they have set up. Hathaway and Marnagan realize the gravity is at play when they seem to lose weight as they get further from the ship. Their own ship wreck experience points them toward discovering how to get to Gunther. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The crash at the beginning of the story is perpetuated by a meteor that Click later determines was sent as a projectile by Gunther himself. He presumes this was done in conjunction with the artificial gravity of the asteroid base in order to fell cargo ships to gather supplies for Gunther and his limited crew of fellow pirates. This crash sets in motion the action that forces Marnagan and Click to confront the monsters, whom Click soon realizes are telepathically imposed and not real at all. Because of this encounter with the monsters, Click discovers a way to defeat Gunther and his forces while dealing with limited resources and using his own technology against him. The crash also provides a dramatic moment in Click\u2019s film."

        "Summary_1": "Telepathy plays an interesting role in this story.  Rather than telepathy being used by one character to discern the thoughts of another character, as is often the case, we instead have machines creating telepathic projections.  It is fitting, then, that since machines are creating the telepathic projections, a machine can also defeat them.  The camera does not \"see\" through interpreting images or trying to understand them.  It only records light and shadow.  For this reason, it remains unaffected by telepathy--it can only record what is there, not what is projected into the mind.\n\nHathaway and Marnagan become trapped in a small cave by what they believe are dangerous wild beasts.  Marnagan asks Hathaway to take his pictures as Marnagan poses against the backdrop of the beasts.  When Marnagan looks at the photos and complains that the beasts do not appear, Hathaway realizes that the beasts are not physically real, but only telepathic projections in the men's minds.  He and Marnagan are then able to dismiss the beasts and bring them back at will in order to let the projections lead them to their source.\n\nTelepathy plays a significant role again when Hathaway and Marnagan formulate a plan to capture Gunther, the person Marnagan is on a mission to capture and the man that caused their crash.  While the two of them could easily overpower Gunther if he were alone, there are at least fifty guards with him at his base.  Hathaway realizes they can photograph Marnagan in poses as though he's taking over the base and use those images in the telepathic projector against the guards and Gunther.  The telepathic projector turns one Marnagan into five hundred, allowing the two men to easily capture the base and Gunther while the guards flee.  The guards are likely aware of the telepathic projectors, but do not suspect that Hathaway and Marnagan have managed to turn the projectors to their own ends.  By using the projectors, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to turn a very dangerous situation into an easy victory. ",
        "Summary_2": "The telepathic projectors create the illusion that the asteroid is populated with a horde of hideous monsters. This impression frightens people whose spaceships crash onto the asteroid so that they will be too afraid to search for the hideout of Gunther and his guards. Hathaway realizes that the monsters are simply images that disappear when people no longer believe they are real when he examines his film of Marnagan with the monsters in the background. When he reviews his film, only Marnagan is visible, so Hathaway realizes that the monsters are not real. Gunther\u2019s telepathic projectors protect him and his men; he needs this added protection because he only has a few men, and Gunther himself is old and crippled, unable to defend himself or move on his own. Just as the telepathic projectors give him protection, they are also his undoing at the end of the story when Hathaway and Marnagan use the projectors against him. They feed in a film that makes it look like 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen are marching toward Gunter\u2019s headquarters, but in reality, it\u2019s only Marnagan with his image reproduced 499 times. Also, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to trick the projector into producing the monsters again to discover where they are coming from. This leads them to find Gunther\u2019s lair where they defeat him.",

They are the source of the monsters that had previously pursued the two after crash-landing on the asteroid.

This turns out to be true, and they are able to make their way to Gunther\u2019s hideaway, where they find oxygen tanks to support them in their next steps. By commandeering use of the projectors for their own purposes, Marnagan and Click are able to trick Gunther\u2019s men into believing Marnagan is the 500-men Patrol come to capture Gunther and defeat his ranks. Marnagan does his best acting like the men, and their images are projected telepathically into the minds of Gunther\u2019s men, who are subsequently defeated.

The show is called \u201cDoctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses,\u201d and it\u2019s a type of gameshow. People and creatures on nine different planets tune into the program, and they ask the geniuses questions. If the show\u2019s experts cannot answer the question, the listener gets a sum of money. Grannie Annie is there to serve as the guest star. \n\nThe show goes off without a hitch. The only remarkable thing that Billy notices is that the audience appears to be mesmerized by Dr. Universe. \n\nGrannie Annie tells Billy that while she was writing a sequel to her latest novel, she met Ezra Karn, and he told her about the Green Flames. The Green Flame is a radioactive rock originally found on Mercury, and the rock\u2019s Gamma Rays have the power to make people and creatures have a strong desire for a leader. Grannie Annie included these fantastical ideas in her recent novel, but her manuscript was stolen.

The narrator is surprised to hear from a member of the staff that there is a woman here to see him--his friend Grannie Annie, who is known by lovers of science fiction novels by her pen name, Annabella C. Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people\u2019s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show. When they arrived, they found the ship outfitted with a self-operating broadcasting unit which was well-protected behind unbreakable glass. The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra\u2019s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show. The group could not find a way to make them laugh, until Grannie read them her book. Their laughter made it into the broadcast, thwarting Doctor Universe\u2019s plans for becoming dictator of the solar system. In the end, Grannie decides she wants to keep writing novels and invites Billy on a trip to Mars for background research for her next book.",

She\u2019s a participant in the Doctor Universe game show, and she wants Billy to watch. \nAfter the show is over, a racist interaction takes place. The I.P. comes around to break it up, but not before one Kagor was seriously hurt. \nGrannie Annie takes Billy into another restaurant and finally explains herself. She was writing a sequel for her last book and was doing research on Venus. There she met Ezra Karn, an older man with plenty of stories to tell. He told her of the Green Flames, an ore that released gamma rays stronger than any drug known to man. They made people receptive and easily manipulated. \nShe wrote a book about it and included many facts that Karn told her, including the location of the remaining Green Flames. The manuscript was stolen, and now she believes that this person is using the Geren Flame to control people. \nBilly immediately thinks the suspect is Doctor Universe, but Grannie blows him off. She thinks that someone has figured out a way to broadcast the emissions. A heat ray blasts toward them, almost killing Grannie Annie. They rush to the hydrocar and get out of there. \nFinally, they reach Level Five close to Vansoom territory, where Karn lives. The Vansooms are energy creatures, extremely dangerous, and volatile. They take a boat, where a trained hunter-bird attacks them. They survive thanks to Grannie\u2019s shooting skills. They meet Karn at last and he agrees to show them to the shipwreck after they listen to the latest Doctor Universe gameshow. \nThey reach the ship and see that someone has added to it.

Overall intellectual lethargy and a clear preference to be led by a despot or dictator. Theorizing that this behavior is the result of exposure to a unique radiation of the Green Flame rock, Annie and Billy investigate in the back country of Venus. As they hunt for an answer they are threatened by would-be assassins who are intent on stopping them. \n\nEventually they uncover that quiz show host, Doctor Universe, is amplifying radiation from a cache of Green Flame and broadcasting it throughout the solar system through his visi program. Annie foils his scheme by broadcasting the laughter of the Varsoom as Doctor Universe tries to announce himself as System Dictator. The story ends as Grannie Annie heads off to Mars with Billy Boy understanding that he was fated to join her in her next adventure."

Come on, you're going with me.\"\n  \n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar.

It read:\n  \n \n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n  \n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n  \n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n  \n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n  \n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard.

The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away.

Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Grannie Annie is a small elderly woman who wears a bonnet and dresses in black. She smokes tobacco and her choice of beverage is whiskey. She is a very well-known science fiction writer, and her work is highly sought after by publishers. Her pen name is Annabella C. Flowers. Her writing includes some repetition. Each novel includes a beautiful woman for the protagonist to fall in love with. Still, Grannie Annie always does her research. If she\u2019s writing about a colony on Venus, she spends weeks there to truly get to know the place before she portrays the setting in her book. \n\nGrannie Annie is bold and intelligent. Although she does not first suspect that Doctor Universe is the wannabe dictator, as soon as Karn mentions that he thinks the Doctor should be king, everything clicks, and Annie recognizes him as the villain. She is a quick thinker and a tinkerer as well. She is able to build a contraption that interrupts Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast in very little time. \n\nWhen the Varsoom laugh at her novel, she gets angry. She clearly takes pride in her work and doesn\u2019t like feeling like a laughingstock. Annie is not a quitter. When Billy asks her if she will continue writing, she already has the idea for her next piece ready to go. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Grannie Annie is a science fiction author who writes under the pen name Annabella C. Flowers. She is very prolific, and also quite well-known. She is dedicated to doing the right research to make her stories as accurately detailed as possible, and often travels to visit the locations she is writing about so that she has lived in those places before she tries to represent them. Because she is a popular figure, she also participates in other public-facing events, such as the Doctor Universe broadcast at the beginning of the story. She is fond of Billy, the narrator, and they clearly trust each other. Physically, she is very slight, but very expressive, and wears very distinctive clothing. Those who know her personally know she is a fireball in terms of her personality, and her readers are constantly hungry for her adventuresome writing. It\u2019s possible that she has written the most science fiction of anyone in her day, and this left her quite well-off, financially. She is also a creative thinker outside of her writing and was the one to come up with the plan to disrupt the Doctor Universe broadcast near the end of the story. Not only did she set up the equipment to be able to include the laughing sounds from the Varsoom, but it was she that eventually got the Varsoom to laugh. Although at first she was insulted that they would laugh at her story, she quickly dusted herself off and knew she would continue writing, and exploring the world while she did it.",
        "Summary_3": "Grannie Annie is not what she seems. Although her appearance reflects her age, at heart she is wild, adventurous, and a tad bit crazy. \nWriting under the pseudonym Annabella C. Flowers, Grannie Annie became one of the most popular science fiction writers. But her books aren\u2019t tomfoolery. She researches each setting before she writes it, traveling to far-off planets to ensure accuracy and attention to detail. \nShe leads Billy and their expeditious team on a great journey. She\u2019s skilled with a gun, killing a highly-trained hunter-bird along the way, and she\u2019s incredibly persistent. When the Vansooms\u2019 laugh at her writing, she, at first, is angry and hurt. But as the story continues, she laughs at the situation, claiming that these creatures wouldn\u2019t know good writing if it hit them in the face. \nHer courage, wildness, and bravery make for a spectacular tale.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Grannie Annie is a successful science fiction author who writes under the name Annabel C. Flowers.

        "Summary_1": "The Green Flames are highly important to the narrative because without them, Doctor Universe would not be able to try and take over the universe. The Green Flames originally come from planet Mercury. When earthlings or other creatures come in contract with the rock\u2019s Gamma rays, their brains instantly desire control from leadership. The element\u2019s power is immense but also subtle. \n\nThe Green Flames have already been used to institute a dictatorship, as with the cautionary tail of Vennox. Vennox forced each creature to keep two of the rocks in each house, and he used their powers to make them servile. When the government was overthrown, the Green Flames were destroyed. \n\nEzra Karn finds the Green Flames hidden away in a spaceship in the Varsoom district of Venus. Doctor Universe has secured the resource and its power when he broadcasts his weekly quiz show, \u201cDoctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses.\u201d The show is a hit on multiple planets, and the quiz master urges his followers to tune in to each broadcast. The Green Flames lead listeners to believe that he is a supreme being and deserves to be in a position of power. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Green Flame is not well understood by the scientific community in the story, but it plays an important role in the history of political power in the system, as well as the contemporary political situation that Grannie Annie is navigating. The rock was originally found on Mercury, and its composition is only partially understood, but it is clear that all types of life forms are affected by the drug-like effects of its radiation. Initially, it appears to just drain some energy, but with increased exposure, the beings search for more direction and guidance, a desire that can be fulfilled by political power of dictators. In fact, it had been used specifically for this purpose on Earth, Venus, and Mars by a dictator named Vennox I. He required that two pieces of Green Flame were in every household, which ensure that the people wanted to look to him for guidance. The stash of this rock that was found in an abandoned ship on the surface of Venus is the last remaining supply, as it was mostly destroyed after the dictatorship ended. When Grannie Annie found out about the supply, through a prospector named Ezra Karn, she decided to use it as part of the plot for her newest novel. However, Doctor Universe used the details of the story to devise his own plot to use the Green Flame to try to start his own dictatorship. He used broadcast technology to extend the effects of the radioactive rock, so that it affected anyone who watched his quiz show. In the end, the plan is not successful, because Billy and Grannie Annie and their team were able to thwart his efforts.",
        "Summary_3": "The Green Flames are a radioactive ore that can and have been used to cause great harm. They emit gamma rays that are incredibly suggestive and powerful when consumed. Vennox I, a dictatorship that ruled over three planets in 2710, used the Green Flames to control their people. \nBy placing the ores in every house, they were able to manipulate and oppress their people. The Green Flames\u2019 power can erase all freedom and individual liberty from a planet. \nWith this kind of power, it\u2019s no wonder that they were all destroyed after Vennox I was overthrown. However, a ship containing a tank full of them crashed, leaving some untouched. Their discovery led to Doctor Universe\u2019s attempt at dictatorship. Luckily, he was foiled along the way.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Green Flame is a type of rock with a specific type of radiation. When a lifeform is exposed to this radiation, its brain begins to deteriorate and display an acute lack of energy that increases with exposure. \n\nThe rocks were outlawed as part of a push for democratized government and supposedly destroyed centuries ago but a large quantity of the rocks were discovered on Venus.\n\nNow as populations are agitating for dictatorial government, it is suspected that it is due to the influence of Green Flame.\n\nIt was revealed that augmented Green Flame radiation was being broadcast through Doctor Universe's quiz show."

Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled.\n  \n<doc-sep>Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't\n   \n   Guns\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pistols\n   \n  ; and it wasn't\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  , it was\n   \n   Pluto\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n  \n \n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n  \n \n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n  \n \n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  Theater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n  \n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\n   \n   Satellite\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\n   \n   zilcon\n   \n  wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men\u2014all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n  \n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\n  \n \n  ONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n  \n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n  \n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n  \n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n  \n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Grannie Annie shows up at the men\u2019s club to see Billy, the two friends have not seen each other in two years. It is immediately clear that Grannie Annie runs the show in their relationship, in part because Billy is willing to risk his reputation at the men\u2019s club in order to make his elderly friends happy. Within minutes, Billy is whisked away to the theater to watch Annie guest star on Doctor Universe\u2019s show, even though she does not explain the plan to him and he has little interest in being an audience member.\n\nAlthough the rest of the world knows Grannie Annie as Annabella C. Flowers, the name she uses to publish her science fiction novels, Billy would never address her so formally. There is an obvious feeling of trust between the two characters. When Grannie Annie gets her novel stolen and worries that there\u2019s a dictator about to take over the universe, she finds Billy to help her solve the case. Similarly, when Grannie Annie spills her guts about her far-fetched theory about her novel inspiring an evil villain to use the Green Flames to control millions of beings, Billy believes her right off the bat. \n\nThe pair get along very well, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s the case when Grannie Annie asks Billy to accompany her on her next trip to research her upcoming novel. Billy simply can\u2019t say no to his friend, whom he deeply admires. \n",
        "Summary_2": "At the time that the story takes place, Billy and Grannie Annie had not seen each other in two years. Even so, they trust one another confidently. At the beginning of the story, we see that Grannie Annie has approached Billy to talk about her concerns for the political climate based on the manuscript of one of her novels. Billy admits to the reader that her story of what was happening, told by anyone else, would be hard to believe, but from her he knows there has to be some truth to it. He also trusts her enough to go along on her expedition to find Ezra, the abandoned ship, and the Green Flame. They know each other well enough ability to know that Grannie\u2019s usual drink is a whiskey sour. At the end of the story, although Billy says he does not want to join on a trip to Mars, he admits to the reader that he knows he will join on another adventure, following Grannie wherever she goes.",
        "Summary_3": "Grannie Annie is Billy\u2019s grandma and confidante. Billy is a little shyer than she is, however they play off of each other and he gains confidence on the journey. This is best shown at the end when she asks if he will come to Mars with her, and he initially says no. Then, he thinks to himself, Of course, I\u2019ll go. \nGrannie Annie shows up at the exclusive, men-only club Billy was playing at and knew he would come with her. Billy acts as her sidekick and trusted partner throughout the story. Despite their age gap, it\u2019s fair to say that their friendship and camaraderie will last a long time.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Billy and Annie are old friends who have had multiple past adventures throughout the solar system. They relate to each other easily and have a sense of mutual respect. Grannie often travels throughout the solar system to gather material for her novels. Billy has often joined her as a partner in her adventures. Billy admires Annie's no-nonsense attitude and commitment to realism. He is brought into the plot to foil Doctor Universe's scheme and aids Annie in accomplishing her plan."

        "Query": "Throughout the story of Doctor Universe, what role does Ezra Karn play and how does he contribute to defeating the Varsoom?",
        "Article": "The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n  \n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n  \n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\n   \n   varpa\n   \n  cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n  \n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n  \n \n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n  \n \n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n  \n \n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away.\n  \n<doc-sep>Inside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes\nfilled with excitement.\n  \n \n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop\nDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.\nRight now we're nicely bottled up.\"\n  \n \n  As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz\nmaster on the screen. He was saying:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Remember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of\nunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow\nnight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the\nVenusians.\n  \n \n  \"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n  \n \n  She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled\nup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship\nwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.\n  \n \n  Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled\nthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.\nNext she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought\nalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.\nShe fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every\ntwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and\nfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.\n  \n \n  Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she\nselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity\nof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and\nout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.\n  \n \n  At length she finished.\n  \n \n  \"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll\ntell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow\nnight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme\ndictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this ship\nunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast\u2014the laughing\nof the Varsoom!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're going to what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.\nVisualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universe\nmakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wild\npeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\"\n  \n \n  \"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn.\n  \n \n  \"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly.\n  \n \n  I, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar\nPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that\nmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly\ntried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter\nsilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the\nscheduled Doctor Universe program.\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. \"Maybe we've got\nto attract their attention first,\" he suggested. \"Miss Flowers, why\ndon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something from\none of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit\nup and take notice.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to her\nfeet quickly.\n  \n \n  \"I'll do it,\" she said. \"I'll read them the attack scene from\n   \n   Murder\nOn A Space Liner\n   \n  .\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Outside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently\nunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire\nand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding\ndesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this\ntime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe\nand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of\nthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe\nprogram.\n  \n \n  \"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once,\nbut I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought\nto make him king or somethin'.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped\nto her feet.\n  \n \n  \"Say that again!\" she cried.\n  \n \n  The old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to\nmake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\"\n  \n \n  \"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness\nand returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this\n   \n   is\n   \n  Doctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a\nmethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's\nhold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such\na way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.\nDon't you see?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.\n  \n \n  \"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames\nradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The\nDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but\nthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations\nfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and\ntheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic\nscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\"\n  \n \n  \"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial\ncontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,\nDoctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the\nminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'\nradiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\"\n  \n \n  I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.\n  \n \n  And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the\ntents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had\ndropped away to be replaced by another.\n  \n \n  There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the\nimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And\nsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the\nold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.\n  \n \n  An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was\nfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.\nOpposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar\npunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.\n  \n \n  \"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our\nonly escape is to make 'em laugh!\"\n  \n \n  He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.\nAbruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped\nand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping\njack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.\n  \n \n  Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen\nblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild\nlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "\nGrannie Annie first meets Ezra Karn when she goes to Venus City to research the setting for her novel. Ezra Karn is a prospector who lives in a deep marsh in Varsoom country. Grannie Annie learns that the Green Flames were not all destroyed after the last dictatorship when he tells her that he stumbled upon the resource in an abandoned spaceship. \n\nGrannie Annie and Billy find Karn at his hut in the marsh. They ask Karn to take them to the Green Flames, and after some hesitation, he agrees. He knows that the only way to defeat the Varsoom is to make them laugh, but he does not know what exactly they think is funny. He is a huge fan of Doctor Universe, and he never misses a show. \n\nEzra Karn successfully takes Grannie Annie and Billy to the spaceship he previously found. Within moments of laying eyes on it, Karl yells out in pain. He rolls around on the ground, trying to stand but failing. He informs his companions that the force he is dealing with is the Varsoom, and the only way to end the madness is to make them laugh. \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to interrupt Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast to stop him from taking over the universe, it is Karn\u2019s idea to have Grannie Annie read her book to the Varsoom. He does not realize that they will find it funny, but he does think it\u2019s a good way to get the invisible creatures\u2019 attention. He essentially saves everyone, since Grannie Annie\u2019s book makes the Varsoom laugh and laugh and make it impossible for Doctor Universe to control the minds of the masses. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Ezra is only present for a small part of the story, but he already knew Grannie Annie as they had met in Venus City. Ezra is a prospector, and he finds his home in the swamps where the Varsoom live. When Grannie Annie and Billy make it to the swamplands and marshes, they find Ezra, and Grannie Annie asks him to guide the group to the spaceship that held the Green Flames he had told her about. He agrees, though he warns the group about the Varsoom, an energy life form that could potentially be dangerous. He refuses to miss a showing of Doctor Universe\u2019s quiz show, but guides the group after the show is over. Ezra was the first person to see the ship they were looking for, and asked about the broadcasting apparatus that was built on top of it. He circled the ship with Grannie as the group split up to survey the area, and once they entered the ship, Ezra tried using his pistol to break the glass that was protecting the equipment. Eventually, after camp was set up, he watched Doctor Universe again as he smoked his pipe. When Ezra suggests that Doctor Universe is a wonderful person to be made a leader, Grannie realizes that Billy was right about Doctor Universe wanting to take over. Ezra, along with the rest of the group, experienced extreme pain as the Varsoom showed up. Ezra reminded the group that they needed to make these beings laugh, and as he did a silly dance, he tripped and fell, which did the trick. Ezra and Billy watch Grannie set up the altered visi set to disrupt the broadcast following day. He set up a lamp for Grannie when she started to read her book to the Varsoom, and once they have the laughter they needed, he turned on the equipment so that the microphone could add the laughter of the Varsoom to the Doctor Universe broadcast.",
        "Summary_3": "Ezra Karn is an elderly explorer, filled to the brim with stories and adventures galore. He first met Grannie Annie while she was researching the sequel to her latest novel. She visited Venus and Karn to fully immerse herself in the culture. His stories were so ludicrous and wonderful that she decided to turn them into her next novel. Once her manuscript was stolen and the secret stash of Golden Flame revealed, Ezra Karn was thrust into the adventure alongside Billy-Boy, her grandson. \nKarn is a devoted fan of Doctor Universe\u2019s gameshow and never missed a single broadcast. He leads their crew into the Vansoom territory, despite his anxiety. Only he and one other man had ever escaped their territory alive. \nHis guidance leaves them safe and sound, and, though he is attacked by the Vansoom, he\u2019s able to stop them by making them laugh. \nWithout Karn, they would have never discovered how to draw the Vansooms\u2019 attention and make them laugh.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him.

        "Summary_1": "O\u2019Rielly is an apprentice maintaining Burner Four during his first flight on a spaceship traveling between Venus and Earth. The story begins when his supervisor, Burner Chief Callahan, alerts O\u2019Rielly that one of the controls on his burner has slipped, so he sets about resetting the controls to prevent the ship from crashing when it starts its descent toward Earth. He searches his watch room and around the burner looking for a mouse or anyone who might have moved the control. He thinks about Captain Millicent Hatwoody, the ship\u2019s commander nicknamed \u201cOld Woman\u201d, and worries she will exile him to a distant moon if she discovers the issue. During his search, he discovers a stowaway Venusian woman named Trillium on his bunk bed, and she tells him she had moved the control in order to escape the burner room where she was hiding. O\u2019Rielly is struck by her beauty and allows her to shower in his bathroom. While she is showering, Callahan to interrogate O\u2019Rielly and instructs him to take a shower because Captain Hatwoody is bringing a guest to tour the facilities. He reminds O\u2019Rielly of the history of the Earth women\u2019s supremacy over men, which began as a response to the Earth men\u2019s infatuation with Venusian women. When they established dominance, the Earth women returned the Venusian women to their planet. Consequently, the Venusian men warned of war if any Earth men attempted to contact Venusian women. For their part, Venusian women would be killed if they tried to leave. To soften the threat, Venus agreed to let Earth purchase products at a lower cost. O\u2019Rielly reminds Callahan that no Earth man has seen a Venusian woman in 125 years, and Callahan tells the story\u2014an Earth man disguised himself as a Venusian in order to visit his love, a Venusian woman named Berta. When Trillium returns, she reveals that she is Berta\u2019s granddaughter. She hides again before Captain Hatwoody arrives. The captain and her guest, a Venusian ambassador named Dimdooly, investigate the burner, and their interactions reveal conflicting attitudes towards gender superiority on Earth versus Venus. As they leave, Trillium reveals herself, and Dimdooly recognizes her as the Venusian president\u2019s granddaughter. Captain Hatwoody then calls the presidents of both planets, who begin to blame each other and threaten war. Trillium explains that it was Berta, the president\u2019s wife, who taught her how to stowaway, as she had done so herself 125 years prior. She reveals her purpose for stowing away was to draw attention to her revolutionary vision\u2014to convince Earth to stop purchasing products from Venus, thus stopping their cash flow to fund wars. She explains the wars distract Venusian men, and that is why the women are attracted to Earth men. While the president balks, his wife orders him to step aside as she has been elected new President of Venus, and the Venusian women are taking over. Trillium is rewarded with Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship, and Callahan and O\u2019Rielly are sent back to work. ",
        "Summary_2": "O\u2019Rielly is an Apprentice Burnerman in charge of the burners of the craft. He is surprised when one of them has a fusion control two points low in flight since he thought he had set everything correctly prior to takeoff.\n\nHe discovers a female from Venus stowing away on the ship. O\u2019Rielly does not view women of power with respect, but he treats this woman differently and is attracted to her. There is a gender-based arrangement where women from Venus are no longer allowed on Earth, so her presence is highly illegal.\n\nCallahan (O\u2019Rielly\u2019s superior) comes into the room and discovers the woman from Venus, thinking she is named Berta. Berta was the grandmother of the stowaway, who is actually named Trillium. She hides under the bed in the room, just as the Captain and Ambassador step in to see what is the problem with the burner. They look at the burner personally, and then discover Trillium before leaving the room.\n\nCaptain calls an interplanetary emergency and both the President of Earth and of Venus are brought into conference call. Trillium is the granddaughter of the President of Venus. The President of Venus has been married to Trillium\u2019s grandmother (Berta) for 124.5 years. The President of Venus tries to convince Trillium that people from Earth stole her away, but Trillium is clear that she learned from Berta (his wife) how to execute her plan. Trillium was raising awareness to Earth to stop trade with Venus to stop funding their wars.\n\nThe President of Earth cancels all trade with Venus. Berta becomes the new President of Venus through a unanimous vote. There are only females on the planet to vote, as all Venus men are at war for 10 months at a time with only 2 weeks home inbetween. Her husband is furious and does not believe women should hold power.\n\nAmbassador Dimdooly proposes marriage to Trillium aboard the spaceship. The President of Earth welcomes the idea of a female ambassador travelling Earth to create a new trade treaty. Trillium is given the role of the new Personal Ambassador in Dimdooly\u2019s place.\n\nThe Captain is tasked with giving O\u2019Rielly and Callahan a suitable reward for \u201caiding in the revolution\u201d.

        "Summary_3": "The story takes place aboard a spaceship, at a distant point in the future when women rule Earth, men rule Venus, and the two planets have a tenuous relationship based on old economic treaties, restrictions, and fears they have about one another. Apprentice Burnerman O\u2019Rielly can\u2019t figure out how one of the burners he was in charge of on a spaceship had a control slip, until he discovers that it was caused by a stowaway: a beautiful woman from Venus, who has a strange and powerful effect on O\u2019Rielly. \n\nHe tries to keep her hidden but she is discovered by his superior, Callahan, who seems to know a lot about the last Earth man to stow away to Venus 125 years ago, and who mistakes the stowaway, Trillium, for her own grandmother, Berta. Trillium seems to want to be found, and is soon revealed to the ship\u2019s Captain, Millicent Hatwoody, and an ambassador from Venus, Dimdooly. Hatwoody alerts the presidents of both Earth and Venus to the situation, and they disagree about what has happened and whose fault it is. The president of Earth thinks Trillium stowing away on an Earth vessel is tantamount to an act of war, while the president of Venus (Trillium\u2019s grandfather) thinks she must have been kidnapped by the Earth men on the ship.\n\nTrillium clarifies that she intentionally stowed away, with help from her grandmother, Berta, in order to ask the president of Earth to stop buying anything from Venus. The women of Venus want the men to stop leaving to fight in wars that the male-dominated government make up reasons to start just to keep the men occupied, and they want Earth to stop funding the wars. As her grandfather is telling Trillium that things are going to stay as they are, the Earth president says she has dissolved all trade with Venus, and Berta enters her husband\u2019s office and announces that the women of Venus have unanimously voted for Berta to take over the presidency and women to unseat the men from power. She has her female enforcers remove her husband. \n\nOn the spaceship, Dimdooly tells Trillium that he loves her and proposes. She is then given his ambassadorship. O\u2019Rielly and Callahan, heavily implied to be the man who stowed away to Venus 125 years ago and met Berta, are no longer under the Venus woman trance, and now the men of Venus are. As the presidents of Venus and Earth congratulate and thank each other, Berta asks that O\u2019Rielly and Callahan be rewarded for accidentally helping with their plan. Captain Hatwoody awards them each five minutes of leisure time, and Callahan thinks they\u2019re lucky to be alive. \n\nAs the story ends, O\u2019Rielly gets Callahan to tell him why the women of Venus didn\u2019t keep him there if they were lonely, and Callahan reveals that because he didn\u2019t have the \u201cearth beards\u201d that men of Venus have to clutch and tickle the women\u2019s ears, he wasn\u2019t of much use to them. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Apprentice Burnerman O\u2019Rielly discovers that one of the burners he is responsible for has been reset, but he can\u2019t figure out how that happened since no one has passed through his room outside the burner room to get to it. When he returns to his watch room, a beautiful woman from Venus is on his bunk. She explains that she changed the setting because she was in the burner room and couldn\u2019t open the door when it grew too warm for her. \n\nO\u2019Rielly\u2019s superior, Chief Callahan, arrives to see what caused the problem. Callahan discovers the woman from Venus. He reminds O\u2019Rielly that the first flight from Earth to Venus was made one thousand years ago, and the men from Earth immediately fell in love with the women from Venus and brought some of them back to Earth. Women on Earth were angered by the Earthmen\u2019s behaviors and took over the control of Earth. They took the Venus women back to Venus and warned that there would be a war if any of them came back to Earth. The last time an Earthman was near a Venus woman was 125 years ago when he stuffed himself into a luggage bag and made himself a pair of fake ear beards with worms in them to make them move so he could pass himself off as a Venus man. \n\nThe girl from Venus steps out of the shower, and Callahan calls her \u201cBerta,\u201d but she says her name is \u201cTrillium\u201d and that her grandmother\u2019s name is Berta. Trillium is said to look just as Berta did 125 years ago. O\u2019Rielly hides Trillium under his cot just before Captain Hatwoody enters to check on the burner problem. She is also escorting the Dimdooly, the Personal Assistant of the President of Venus, on a ship tour. Just as the Ambassador and Hatwoody are leaving, Trillium makes a loud bump, and they discover her. The Ambassador is certain she has been kidnapped, but Trillium explains that she stowed away.\n\nHatwoody takes everyone to her office where she calls the presidents of both Earth and Venus. The president of Venus is Trillium\u2019s grandfather. He says she couldn\u2019t have stolen away on her own and demands the truth, so she explains that her grandmother, his wife, told her how to do it. Trillium explains she stowed away to bring the cause of the Venus women to Earth\u2019s attention. She wants Earth to stop trading with Venus so that Venus won\u2019t have the money to keep sending its men to wars for all but two weeks every year. The Venus president\u2019s wife interrupts and declares she\u2019s taking over the presidency; she orders her women to take her husband away and appoints Trillium her new ambassador. O\u2019Rielly realizes Callahan was the last Earthman to meet a Venus woman in person and was the one who tried to stow away to Venus. He was caught because his fake ear beards didn\u2019t grab hold of Berta\u2019s ears like real ones do.\n"

Earth women were angry at how the men acted and took control of the planet; they also sent all the Venus women back to their home planet. Now Earth and Venus trade with each other, but Earthmen and Venus women are not allowed to be together because doing so can spark a war between the two planets. Earth has a female president, and women hold all the positions of authority over men. Venus has a male president who is very traditional and does not agree with the women of Venus that their men need to be home for more than two weeks every year and spend the rest of their time fighting in wars.

When O\u2019Rielly is trying to hide Trillium in his shower, Callahan tells the story of when women first took control of Earth: They were not pleased that Earth men were so entranced by Venusian women, and so they took over leadership of the planet and sent all Venusian women back to their own planet. Likewise, Venusian men banned Earth men from interacting with Venusian women under threat of war. This led to an agreement where Earth and Venus could conduct trade together for cheaper prices. Callahan suggests that he was the last man to touch a Venusian woman, and he did so by hiding himself inside a large bag and sneaking through customs disguised as a Venusian man with a long, fake beard.

        "Summary_1": "Trillium is the granddaughter of the President of Venus and his wife, Berta. One-hundred twenty-five years ago, Berta learned from Callahan\u2019s example how to stowaway and break the rules devised between the two planets. She taught her granddaughter how to do the same, so Trillium took this knowledge to implement her own plan. Trillium represents the women of Venus, who are tired of the lack of attention they receive from Venusian men; the men are far more interested in war and harbor misogynistic attitudes towards women. Likewise, the women rulers of Earth treat men as their inferiors as a result of their lust for Venusian women. When Trillium is discovered, this triggers a meeting between the two presidents of Earth and Venus, and the president of Earth announces that her presence on the ship signifies a breach in their rules. Therefore, the special arrangement between the two planets is ended, and Earth no longer recognizes Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship. As the Venusian president resists, he also learns that his wife Berta has been elected the new President of Venus, and that women will now take over just as they did on Earth. She orders her husband to be taken away. After Dimdooly loses his position, he announces his love for Trillium, which confirms her plan to regain the amorous attentions of Venusian men has worked. As a reward for her role in the revolution, Trillium receives Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship.\n",
        "Summary_2": "She wanted to bring attention to her cause as a revolutionary and explain that if Earth would stop buying things from Venus, then they would stop funding Venus\u2019 wars like they have been for the past 10,000 years. Trillium explains that women of Venus would like the men of Venus to instead remain on the planet and do useful work. \nHowever, it turns out that Trillium is part of a larger plan for her grandmother to overthrow her grandfather as President of Venus, which they succeed in doing.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Trillium\u2019s plan, which she undertook at her grandmother\u2019s behest and with her assistance, was to stow away on the Earth ship to draw the Earth president\u2019s attention to her cause. Berta and Trillium want to beseech Earth\u2019s government to stop supporting Venus\u2019s economy and funding their constant warfare. The women of Venus want the men of Venus to spend time with them rather than constantly going into battle, and Berta and Trillium have devised a way to get Earth to cooperate in their efforts to switch control of Venus from men to women. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Trillium plans to follow her grandmother\u2019s plan and stow away on the ship and travel to Earth. She stows away because that is the only way that the women of Venus can get the attention of Earth\u2019s president. She wants Earth to agree to stop trade with Venus so that Venus will no longer have the money to keep its men in wars all the time. She claims that Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war that they don\u2019t have time for the Venus women. It is the Venus women\u2019s desire to be loved that makes them so irresistible to Earthmen. Although the Venus government allows its men two weeks at home from war each year, the Venus women want their men for longer than that so that the men can do useful work. As a result of the stowaway incident, the president of Earth cancels all trade agreements with Venus. Once Venus women have the Venus men under their power, they no longer have any interest in Earthmen. When Trillium\u2019s grandmother becomes president of Venus, she makes Trillium the new Ambassador to Earth."

        "Summary_1": "Captain Hatwoody is the commander of the ship that ferries between Earth and Venus. She is a stern, efficient Earth woman with a vocal disdain for men. Behind her back, the men of her crew refer to her as \u201cthe Old Woman.\u201d Ambassador Dimdooly is a Venusian who works as the right-hand man of the President of Venus. Similar to Hatwoody\u2019s disgust for men, Ambassador Dimdooly harbors a deep-seated misogyny. Both characters\u2019 innate sexism is reflected in the social orders of their individual planets and are the result of over one-hundred years of conflict. Captain Hatwoody plays gracious host to Ambassador Dimdooly when he visits the ship, even referring to him as \u201cExcellency.\u201d However, their tensions are revealed when together they inspect Burner Four after visiting O\u2019Rielly in his watch room. They each make snarky comments to each other about the inferiority of the others\u2019 respective gender. Their attitudes are reflected later during the confrontational meeting between the presidents of Earth and Venus in Captain Hatwoody\u2019s office.

Dimdooly is an Ambassador being shown around the ship of which Hatwoody is the captain. Dimdooly appears to be disgusted at the male crew members taking orders from a woman, and he and the captain disagree about who should get \u201cprecedence\u201d in terms of who will shower first and where based on which of them has the superior status.

        "Summary_4": "Captain Hatwoody is giving Ambassador Dimdooly a tour of Earth\u2019s ship. When Hatwoody orders Callahan and O\u2019Rielly to attention, Dimdooly sneers at the sight of the two men being subservient to a woman.

        "Article": "\"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured\nEarthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that\nmust have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n  \n \n  \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he\nwears he might be Thig.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we\nwill transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to\nthe brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without\narousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the\ntwo inner planets.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear\nthese clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use\nof our limbs so.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling\nout his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that\nyou disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted\nTerry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n  \n \n  Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully\ncultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they\nknew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely\nlacking in their early training and later life. They were trained\nantlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde\nwere of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling\nrobots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,\ntheir love-life, their everything!\n  \n \n  So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped\non two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to\none another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their\nheads.\n  \n \n  For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain\ndry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman\nproved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped\ncompletely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his\nbody and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured\nbrain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n  \n \n  \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.\n\"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new\nbody must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is\naroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming\nbaubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.\"\n  \n \n  An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and\npainless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship\nand set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running\ninland to his home.\n  \n \n  Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood\nmemories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place\nwhere Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that\nold 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of\nthat episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his\npocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n  \n \n  He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on\nthe sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little\nEarth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his\nacquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from\naround his heart.\n  \n \n  Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the\ndead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men\nhad no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other\nprimitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding\nthe emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n  \n \n  Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,\ntrembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked\nachingly up into his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called\nup at the landing but you were not there.

He looked out across the\nheaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly\naround at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and\nstarted toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully\nbecause of the lesser gravitation.\n  \n \n  Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha he\nwas well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick and\npowerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features\nwere regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were\na curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore\nno garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his\nrod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n  \n \n  The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the\nlittle-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to\nwait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to\nbring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space\ncruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's\nmentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a\nplanet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n  \n \n  Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them\nall only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,\nhowever, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every\nrespect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope\nmade of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\n  \n \n  The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a\nleafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered\nwith baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal\nand wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\n  \n \n  Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's\nstupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished\nmetal at the reflection of himself!\n  \n \n  The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious\ntime. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the\nintervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped\nacross the mouth and neck of the stranger....\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\n  \n \n  For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had\nhe acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously\nadopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this\nway, he realized\u2014more natural.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the\nglittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used\nto hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing\nbut a handful of these.\"\n  \n \n  He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung,\nunbelieving, to his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new\ntrailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right\naway.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages\nand gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he\nhoped that the west had reformed.\n  \n \n  \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm\nwarming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from\nthe Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Three aliens from the planet Ortha, Thig, Kam and their Commander, Torp, have landed on Long Island to see if Earth is viable for the Orthans to take over. Thig captures a passing man, an author named Lewis Terry, and brings him back to the spaceship, where Torp decides that Thig should impersonate Terry to learn more about Earth. Terry\u2019s knowledge is transferred to Thig, a process that kills Terry and arms Thig with with all of his memories. He is given plastic surgery to look like Terry, and he goes to live with Terry\u2019s family. \n\nHe is greeted by Terry\u2019s three young children and his wife, Ellen; the children\u2019s affection and Ellen\u2019s kiss lead to sensations that confuse but excite Thig. The story then jumps ahead 12 weeks to when they return from their vacation, Thig having experienced many new emotions and sensations and having become very attached to Terry\u2019s family. He knows that he must report to his Orthan colleagues, but has misgivings about doing so. Upon his arrival back to the ship, he tells Torp that Earth is ideal for their purposes, and Torp commends him and says he\u2019ll recommend that Ortha take it over and eradicate the humans. Thig suggests that they instead disarm and exile the humans, and train them in the ways of Ortha. Torp responds angrily that they don\u2019t need to waste their time with anyone outside the Orthan \u201cHorde\u201d. He asks Kam to check his blood for disease. \n\nThig realizes that he loves Ellen and wants to protect her and the earthlings and says as much to Kam, who attempts to subdue him. After a struggle over Kam\u2019s blaster, Thig kills him. Torp sees what he has done and flies into the type of rage Orthans don\u2019t ascribe to, bludgeoning Thig until he thinks he is dead. Thig takes a blaster from a case above him and kills Torp. He reads in the ship log that Torp has written that Earth is not viable, because it infected Thig with a disease that led to him killing Kam and made it necessary for Torp to kill him. Thig puts the ship on autopilot toward Ortha, takes one of the small auxiliary ships, and heads back to Earth. \n\nHe experiences many emotions, and regrets how callous he was when he first arrived on Earth and captured Lewis Terry. He vows to live as Terry in repayment to his family, and thinks knowing that Ellen doesn\u2019t really love him, Thig, will be his punishment while he strives to make her happy. As he heads toward Long Island, the idea for a story develops in his mind. This one is about a cowboy that visits other worlds, worlds like the ones Thig has seen. He thinks maybe he could write this, and then reminds himself to remember that he is Lewis Terry now. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with the protagonist Thig, who is an alien from the planet Ortha, on a mission to investigate Earth\u2019s suitability to be colonized by the conquering Horde he represents. Thig is a bit shorter than the average human with a thick, muscular body and reddish hair. His spaceship is hidden below the sand at a Long Island beach, and after he emerges, he hides behind the brush along a nearby road. He sees a human that looks remarkably like himself. This human turns out to be a Western writer named Lewis Terry, who lives nearby with his wife and children. Lew, as his wife calls him, had been out fishing as he tried to plot out new stories to fund his proposed trip out West, where he could gather research to make his writing more believable. Thig knocks him out and takes him back to his ship, where he and his fellow Orthans Kam and Torp begin the process of transferring Lew\u2019s memories, thoughts, and emotions into Thig\u2019s mind. This allows him to disguise himself as he researches Earth\u2019s environment and the humans that populate it. After undergoing plastic surgery to better mimic Lew\u2019s appearance, Thig returns to Lew\u2019s home, guided by his memories of the past and human emotions. Thig meets Lew\u2019s children and experiences emotions of love for the first time. These feelings are further complicated when he meets Ellen, Lew\u2019s wife, who kisses him and floods Thig\u2019s new Lew-mind with romantic emotions. Thig shows Ellen the treasures he has brought with him from Mars, and Ellen says they can now afford to pay for their trip out West. They spend the next three months exploring the West, during which time Thig plunges deeper into human emotion and is overwhelmed by the beauty of Earth. Upon his return to the ship, Thig attempts to convince Kam and Torp to change their plans about destroying humankind, and they think Thig has contracted some kind of disease. When Kam goes to test Thig, Thig kills him with a decomposition blaster; in turn, Torp beats Thig until he thinks he has killed him. Torp then returns to his desk and makes a note that Earth is probably not suitable for the Horde due to a mysterious disease that had overtaken Thig. Thig kills Torp and returns to Earth in an escape vessel, sending the ship back to Ortha with Torp\u2019s message. Torp goes back to Ellen and the children, intending to spend the rest of his life living as Lewis Terry.\n",

He went out on his boat to fish, and Thig jumps out at Terry and kills him.\nThig is excited to help his people, the Orthans, discover a new place to inhabit. On planet Ortha, everything is done to serve the Horde. The creatures have no families. They instead devote their lives to society. \nOn the spaceship, Thig takes over Terry\u2019s body and gains all of his knowledge. He then undergoes surgery to correct the scars that Terry sustained during the attack. When he exits the spaceship, Thig is surprised to learn that he now holds all of Terry\u2019s childhood memories and understandings about the world around him. \n\nHe approaches Terry\u2019s home and is greeted by his children and his wife. Thig feels pleasure from this interaction, something he has never experienced before. When Ellen talks to Thig, he naturally responds like Terry would without even thinking about it. The family heads out on a vacation in the West.\n\nAfter several weeks, Thig\u2019s family arrives back at home. He loved building relationships with his wife and children, and soon he will need to talk to his fellow Orthans and let them know that Earth is a perfect place for them to take over. He worries about what will become of Terry\u2019s family. Thig enjoys being an Earthman because he is allowed to feel and express emotions and experience the uncertainty of life that does not exist on Ortha. \n\nWhen Thig leaves the house to go to the spaceship, his mind keeps coming up with ideas for new Western novels. He can\u2019t help it since he still has many of Terry\u2019s old thoughts. Torp decides it\u2019s time to head back to Ortha. He will recommend killing all humans. Thig disagrees, and Torp becomes angry. He assumes that Thig has contracted a disease, and he tells Kam to test him. The ship blasts off, and in a fit of rage, Thig chokes Kam. They wrestle over Kam\u2019s weapon, and Thig makes Kam shoot himself in the torso. Torp comes into the room and hits Thig over the head with a gun. \n\nTorp leaves Thig bleeding and alone in the laboratory. When he wakes up, he is injured, but he manages to grab a weapon. When Torp comes back in the room, he begins shrieking. Thig shoots the commander. \n\nThig finds Torp\u2019s note that says that Earth holds some disease that causes insanity, and therefore it is not appropriate for colonization. He sets the spaceship for Ortha and takes an auxiliary ship back to Earth. Happiness overtakes him as he heads back to his new home. He has zero regrets about leaving Ortha forever. Thig now believes in God, and realizes that his duty is to take care of Terry\u2019s family for the rest of his life. He thinks up a Western plot about a cowboy who visits another planet.\n",

Thig captures Lewis Terry, a fiction writer with writer\u2019s block and taking the day off to go fishing. Terry bears an uncanny likeness to Thig, and Torp decides to transfer Terry\u2019s knowledge to Thig and have Thig explore Earth to determine whether it will be appropriate for the Orthans.

When Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, tells him he received a check for $50 for one of her stories, Thig immediately comments that the story was worth $100\u2014and is stunned to realize he is thinking like Terry, not himself. He shows Ellen the stones he dug up from an old wooden box that he remembered learning about in Terry\u2019s childhood, and she exclaims they are worth a fortune and will finance a travel trailer and their trip out West.\n\nAfter returning from their western trip, Thig realizes he needs to report back to Torp about whether Earth is an appropriate planet for the Orthans. He knows it is perfect and that the Orthans will destroy every Earth person, and he begins to wonder why they would have to destroy them. As he makes his way to the space cruiser, he comes up with a new Western story to write.\n\nWhen Thig makes his report to Torp, Torp agrees that Earth is perfect for the Orthans and grows angry when Thig asks if they couldn\u2019t just disarm the Earth people rather than destroying all of them. Torp orders Kam to check Thig\u2019s blood for disease. The space cruiser blasts off, and Thig thinks about Ellen and her children with Lewis Terry and realizes he loves them and must protect them. He tells Torp and Kam to turn back\u2014that there is a woman who needs him and the Horde from Ortha doesn\u2019t need Earth. Thig fights and kills Kam, but Torp realizes what is happening and catches Thig off-guard. Torp beats Thig almost to death, and when Thig regains consciousness, he kills Torp and returns to Earth via a lifeboat.

        "Summary_1": "The story is set in multiple locations, including Long Island, New York, an Orthan spaceship and smaller auxiliary ship, parts of the American West, and outer space. The ship from Ortha lands on Long Island in New York, and this is where Thig captures Lewis Terry and takes him to the Orthans\u2019 spaceship, before settling in with his family, posing as Terry. This area of Long Island is near the beach and the sound, and is described as lush and green. The Terry family lives in a small grey house that is somewhat run down. While we don\u2019t travel out west on the Terry family vacation, we do experience bits of it in Thig\u2019s memory, including the Grand Canyon in Arizona and unspecified desert terrain. The story then takes us back to the ship, and a small laboratory aboard the ship, and then inside a smaller ship as it heads back to Long Island. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Lew\u2019s family lives near a beach on Long Island. When the story begins, Thig emerges from his spaceship, which is buried below this beach. He sees dense, green brush beyond the beach running along a highway with little traffic. This is where he chooses to hide and waits to overtake Lew. Thig\u2019s interactions with Kam and Torp take place on the spaceship below the beach surface; this is also where they kill Lew during the brain transfer with Thig. Thig reunites as Lew with Ellen and their children at their beach home and joins them on an epic, three-month journey out West where he sees the Grand Canyon and is overwhelmed by the beauty of the desert with its sagebrush and cacti and variety of colors. Later, Torp charts a path back to Ortha, where they will report their findings. Thig kills Torp and Kam aboard the spaceship, and then he commandeers an escape vessel to make his way back to Earth and back to Ellen and the children.",
        "Summary_3": "Most of the story, The Quest of Thig, takes place on Long Island. When Thig first appears on Earth, he is standing in the seaweed and sand, looking out at the Long Island Sound. There are trees and lots of greenery along the shoreline. He notes that this planet appears to be perfect for the Orthans because it has sunlight, lots of water, and a dense atmosphere. \n\nTerry\u2019s little gray house has a dilapidated front porch and a screen door. There is an old swing that creaks when it\u2019s used. The family owns a gray car and a trailer.  Ellen makes simple meals for her family in their kitchen. \nDuring the family\u2019s trip out West, they visit the Grand Canyon where they see red dunes in the desert and sagebrush and cacti. \n\nThe other setting in the story is the Orthans\u2019 spaceship. When Thig takes Terry\u2019s body back to his spaceship to take over his body and mind, there are two parallel metal tables in the operation room. Both Thig and Terry\u2019s body wear helmets to transfer the information from one to the other. Later in the story, Thig is taken to the laboratory on the ship to get his blood checked for a disease. The lab is neatly set up with instruments hanging from the wall and weapons hanging from the ceiling. There is also a control room on board. The space ship also has six auxiliary miniature spaceships nested inside the larger vessel. \n",
        "Summary_4": "There are three settings in the story, two of which are present in the story and the third is remembered. The first setting is the space cruiser that brings the Orthans to Earth. The space cruiser lands on a beach across the Sound from Connecticut. It is buried in the sand to prevent it from being seen by the Earthmen. It contains a laboratory with instruments and gauges that enable the Orthans to capture the memories and knowledge of another species. It is also outfitted with their decomposition blasters that reduce living organisms to flaky ashes. There is also a control room where Torp guides the space cruiser on its travels through the galaxy and keeps the ship\u2019s log detailing its journeys and findings. Wastes are disposed of with a refuse lock. The ship carries auxiliary lifeboats, which are basically miniatures of the larger ship, for emergencies.\n\nThe setting on Earth is based in Connecticut where the space cruiser lands on a beach. There is sand at the beach, trees and shrubs, highways, and other manmade features. It also features Lewis Terry\u2019s cottage where he lives with his family. It is a weathered small gray house with sagging boards, a front porch, and a porch swing. When the family visits the West, they stop at the Grand Canyon, and Thig is breathless when he sees its beauty. He also notes the sun-painted red peaks in the desert and beautiful starry nights.\n\nThig remembers Ortha as dull, gray, and black and associates it with a monotonous routine.\n"

        "Query": "How does the society of Ortha differ from the society that Thig encounters on Earth in the Quest of Thig?",
        "Article": "\"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured\nEarthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that\nmust have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n  \n \n  \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he\nwears he might be Thig.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we\nwill transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to\nthe brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without\narousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the\ntwo inner planets.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear\nthese clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use\nof our limbs so.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling\nout his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that\nyou disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n  \n \n  \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted\nTerry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n  \n \n  Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully\ncultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they\nknew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely\nlacking in their early training and later life. They were trained\nantlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde\nwere of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling\nrobots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,\ntheir love-life, their everything!\n  \n \n  So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped\non two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to\none another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their\nheads.\n  \n \n  For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain\ndry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman\nproved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped\ncompletely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his\nbody and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured\nbrain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n  \n \n  \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.\n\"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new\nbody must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is\naroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming\nbaubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.\"\n  \n \n  An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and\npainless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship\nand set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running\ninland to his home.\n  \n \n  Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood\nmemories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place\nwhere Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that\nold 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of\nthat episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his\npocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n  \n \n  He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on\nthe sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little\nEarth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his\nacquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from\naround his heart.\n  \n \n  Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the\ndead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain.

That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked\nachingly up into his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called\nup at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that\nSaddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"\nand three other editors asked for shorts soon.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks\nlater and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt\nbeside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n  \n \n  \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went\non as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as\nbeautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n  \n \n  Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the\nexposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car\nand the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living\nquarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the\nchaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n  \n \n  Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows\nand report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,\nincluding Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force\nto wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,\nof course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be\nlanded. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,\nimperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the\nHordes?\n  \n \n  Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the\ndead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three\nmonths he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed\nfor reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady\nglory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had\nexperienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against\nthe wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt\ndivision of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer\nthought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty\nadded zest to every day's life.\n  \n \n  The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to\nthe Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,\nwould one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add to\nthe progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan\ncivilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain\nwell-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast\nmechanical hives.\n  \n \n  There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had\ncaught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath\nthem. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid\nred the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and\ncactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,\nwho nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the son\nof Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n  \n \n  Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better\nof his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to\nblast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the\nroad toward the beach.\n  \n \n  The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly\nbut they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the\ndoor and called after him.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n  \n \n  He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she\nwould have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of\nperson when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a\nhand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n  \n \n  Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the\nautumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that\nlived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked\nin the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the\ncareless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be\nsapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never\nbe written, but he toyed with the idea.\n  \n \n  So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from\nthe unquestioning worship of the Horde!\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  QUEST OF THIG\n  \n \n  By BASIL WELLS\n  \n \n  Thig of Ortha was the vanguard of the conquering\n   \n  \"HORDE.\" He had blasted across trackless space\n   \n  to subdue a defenseless world\u2014only to meet on\n   \n  Earth emotions that were more deadly than weapons.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1942.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beach\nover the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubby\nship from another planet with the upper air.

        "Summary_1": "The society on Ortha has discarded what they consider to be primal or barbaric tendencies and customs. Their children are raised in laboratories never knowing their parents and are not shown love or affection. They are taught to value loyalty to the Orthan \u201cHordes\u201d over everything, and to believe that they are entitled to anything in the universe that they desire, with no regard to those outside the Hordes. They don\u2019t have mates or have sex, though they do walk around naked. Free thought and primal urges are discouraged, and Orthan society has attempted to filter out any behavior they consider to be barbaric in favor of a robotic, obedient populace. By contrast, Thig discovers that humans feel the full gamut of emotions, think for themselves, and feel empathy rather than the dispassionate callousness Ortha demands. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Orthans are a race totally committed to the advancement of the Horde, which travels around the universe seeking to find new planets to overthrow and inhabit. Over the years, their minds have been programmed to think only of the good of the Horde, with no thought to sentimental emotions or feelings. When Thig receives Lewis Terry\u2019s mind, he also receives his mentality, his thoughts, his memories, and his emotions. He experiences for the first time how humans feel. He describes the warmth of hugging Lew\u2019s children, and the choking-warm sensation of kissing his wife, Ellen. He feels awe when standing before the Grand Canyon and learns to feel excitement about the unpredictability of human behavior and emotion. He feels love, hate, and sadness. All of these emotions stand in stark contrast to the Orthan way of life, which is carefully regimented and devoid of any of these kinds of feelings.",
        "Summary_3": "On Ortha, the aliens are raised in the laboratories of their Horde. The Orthans function in a collective society. They do not believe in the individual. There are no families, no romantic relationships or sex, and no friends. Everything that is done must be done for the greater society, much like an ant farm. The Orthans are looking for a new planet to colonize, and they send out Torp, Kam, and Thig on the mission.\n\nOrthans are incapable of feeling emotions and all of their primitive impulses have been done away with. The aliens are part of a strict caste system where they are only allowed to have certain thoughts according to their position in the Horde. They have acted this way for over one hundred thousand years. \n\nOrthans believe they are superior to Earthmen, whom they see as feeble and weak. They believe they have the right to take whatever planet is best for them, and killing billions of Earthmen means nothing to them. \n",
        "Summary_4": "On Ortha, men are loyal to the Horde, and that is all they care about. They are cultured and brought to life in laboratories, so there are no fathers or mothers and no affection and love. From childhood on, males and females in Ortha are taught that the only important thing is the growth and power of the Horde. Men and women have no feelings outside of their devotion to the Horde. Men have no mates and children, which prevents Thig from first understanding the warm feeling that sweeps over him when Lewis Terry\u2019s children greet him and Ellen kisses him on the first night he goes to their home. On Ortha, men have no independent ideas or interests; everything they think and do is to maintain the Horde. For this reason, their civilization has remained static for a hundred thousand years.\n\nOn Earth, men and women love each other and marry and have children. Men are focused on the well-being of their families and their own lives rather than on the well-being of their population as a whole. Earthmen have independent thoughts and make their own decisions.

When he returns to the ship after spending three months with Ellen, he feels the strong urge to return to her and spend the rest of his life with her. He abandons the call of the Horde and completely rejects his old way of living. He would rather spend his life feeling things that are new and with purpose as opposed to the pointless conquering of his old life.",
        "Summary_3": "Ellen is Lewis Terry\u2019s red-headed wife, and she has a major impact on Thig and his way of thinking. In the beginning, Thig is only interested in finding a new home for his people, the Orthans. However, from their first hug alone, Thig begins to have feelings for Ellen. He likes the way that she offers him food and coffee and knows when something is bothering him. He is pleased with her excitement when he shows her the treasure he found at the beach. Thig loves spending the three months with Ellen and her children in their trailer exploring the West. She appreciates the beautiful landscape of the Grand Canyon, but she also acknowledges that there isn\u2019t anything more beautiful in the world than their little piece of land and sky at home. \n\nThig realizes he has to kill Kam and Torp, his fellow Orthans, when he can\u2019t stand the thought of leaving Ellen behind for good. He has experienced love and fun and curiosity with her, and he can\u2019t go back to his old life as a member of the Horde. He loves Ellen, and he is willing to risk it all to be with her and take care of her, especially because he is the reason she is alone without a partner to look out for her. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Ellen is Lewis Terry\u2019s wife who unknowingly makes Thig fall in love. Ellen is a supportive wife who celebrates her husband\u2019s accomplishments when he sells a story. She is excited when Thig shows her the gems they can use to finance their trip out West. Ellen thinks of her husband\u2019s needs, and rather than fussing at him when he comes home late, she asks where he has been but immediately shifts to caring for his needs. Thig enjoys sharing the beautiful views of the West with Ellen, and he likes matching wits with her. From her, he learns what he and other Orthans are missing by not having meaningful relationships with members of the opposite sex. Thig is touched by her sensitivity to his moods and her understanding when something is troubling him. When Torp announces that Earth is a perfect planet for the Orthans to take over, Thig knows this means they will kill all the humans. He thinks of Ellen as helpless and alone and cannot bear to be separated from her; he wants to return to her and protect her. He realizes he loves her and that he will sacrifice his Orthan identity to be with her and support her dreams and happiness."

        "Summary_1": "Joe and Harvey land on Planetoid 42 and enter a bar. They see Genius, an incredible looking creature with six limbs, and immediately become interested in him. They tell the bartender, Johnson, that they\u2019re very thirsty, so he sells them each eight glasses of water, and they guzzle them down. Harvey and Joe are horrified to find out that the water is highly expensive. Johnson explains that the water must be purified. When the pair leaves, they find a pipe in a small pond and realize that Johnson has undoubtedly swindled them. The sweet water is readily available and it is transported directly to the saloon via this pipe. \n\nHarvey and Joe head back to the bar. Joe comes down with a sudden illness, and it\u2019s clear that this is a con the men use all the time. Johnson recognizes that Joe has asteroid fever and becomes frightened. Harvey explains that the only medication that will provide an instant cure is the one they happen to be selling: La-anago Yergis.\n\nJoe is instantly cured once Harvey pours the special liquid into his mouth. Johnson is flabbergasted and wants to purchase an entire case. While in the privacy of their ship, Joe and Harvey discuss their joint desire to purchase Genius. They believe they could make a fortune off of him if they featured him in an exhibit. \n\nJohnson accepts the fake solution and informs Harvey and Joe that his restaurant is open. After looking at the menu, the men are astounded at the low prices. However, they soon find out that they have been taken advantage of when they receive a bill for a very large sum of money. They learn that the fine print they missed on the menu explains the charge. When Joe tells Johnson they won\u2019t pay the bill, Johnson reminds them that he is in fact the Sheriff as well as the saloon owner and the mayor. \n\nHarvey requests to purchase Genius, and Johnson agrees. In a last ditch effort to recoup some more money, Harvey brings up an invention they have on their ship that Johnson must see. Joe brings back a radio that was supposedly created by a famous doctor. It is special because it broadcasts from the fourth dimension. They convince Johnson that he is the perfect person to make sense of the garbled transmissions. Johnson pays extra for the special batteries it takes.\n\nJust as Harvey and Joe make it back to the ship with Genius, the creature informs them that he cannot leave the planet because another planet\u2019s pressure would squish him to death. And yes, he admits, Johnson was fully aware of this fact when he sold him. \n\nWhen Harvey does the math involved in the various exchanges of goods, he realizes that after all that time and the several cons they engaged in, he and Joe made a measly four cents. The men take off on their ship and head to Mars. \n\n",

They arrive on Planetoid 42, a nearly uninhabited asteroid, with a desperate need for water. They come upon the only habitation on the planet and receive water that they are grossly overcharged for. They deal with Johnson, the lone authority on the planet, who is a grifter himself. They duo and Johnson proceed to swindle each other out of money using various schemes and deceptions. As they leave the planet Harvey and Joe realize that they have broke completely even, losing as much money as they gained.",
        "Summary_3": "Harvey Ellswroth and Joe Mallon land on this Planetoid 42 in search of water. These solar salesmen travel the galaxy selling their miraculous elixir, which isn\u2019t so miraculous after all. They find water and are served by Johnson, the barmen, sheriff, and general chief of the land. After drinking eight glasses, their thirst is quenched and they\u2019re ready to pay. At the sight of the large check, they are rightfully appalled, until Johnson explains the reason behind it. The water on this planet is so bitter that it must undergo a rigorous purification process to make it drinkable. Harvey and Joe believe him and pay their sum. They ask if they can fill up the water tank for their spaceship as well, and Johnson points them to the pond. The water there is bitter, but they haul it back and forth. Joe notices a reflection not too far from them and discovers another pond with sweet drinkable water. They realize that they\u2019ve been conned by Johnson. \nThey rush back to the bar to confront him when they meet his son, Jed. Jed is huge, and Harvey and Joe abandon their plan. Quickly, Harvey changes course and asks Jed if he\u2019s feeling ill. Jed feigns illness and collapses, while Johnson assumes it\u2019s the notorious asteroid fever. Harvey rushes to the ship to grab their miraculous cure and forces Joe to drink it. He rises, convincing Johnson of its powers. Johnson quickly asks to buy cases of it, and Harvey agrees, supplying it at a great price. The men run back to the ship to prepare the vials. Harvey is supplementing them with the bitter water, so they save more snake oil. \nJohnson invites them to eat at his restaurant when they return with the medicine. He cons them yet again here by including a hefty fee at the bottom of the paycheck for the entertainment that Genius provided. \nHarvey and Joe still decide to barter further and arrange a monetary transaction in exchange for Genius. Johnson agrees though he admits he will miss him. At this, Harvey decides on one last con and sends Joe to pick up their most prized possession. A radio that can reach the fourth dimension. Johnson buys into it and sits down to attempt to translate garbled English. Harvey, Joe, and Genius leave quickly before Johnson realizes the radio is nothing more than tomfoolery. \nHowever, the last con is played on Harvey and Joe, as Genius reveals he is unable to leave this planet due to atmospheric pressure differences. Harvey and Joe leave him behind. \nThey count their money and realize they haven\u2019t made any real profit. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Harvey Ellsworth and Joe Mallon have landed on Planetoid 42, somewhere between Mars and Ganymede, out of water and in need of supplies. They find a saloon manned by a six-armed life-form and a bartender named Johnson. Harvey and Joe ask for water, which they get, but are charged forty buckos, presumably because there is a high price to get water filtered in this area. The men are astounded but Harvey tries to be understanding of the unusual situation, and pays Johnson the money he asks for. It turns out that Johnson is not just the bartender, but also the mayor, among other jobs. He works out a deal for the men to fill their tanks with purified water, claims to give them a bargain price, and sends his assistant out to the pumps to help the men. Although purified water is expensive, unpurified water used as battery fluid is free, and Johnson points the men to the body of water where they can find what they need. As Joe and Harvey are collecting battery water, they find pipes that carry purified water to the saloon from a clean pool\u2014Johnson had lied about the purification system, and thus charged them way more than the water was worth (twice), so Harvey decides they need revenge. Joe pretends to get asteroid fever, which terrifies Johnson, and Harvey concocts a fake medicine using some of the bitter water to convince Johnson to buy a case from him. The back-and-forth of cons continues: Johnson lures them into a meal with inexpensive food but an expensive hidden surcharge for service and entertainment. Then, Harvey \u201cconvinces\u201d Johnson to sell him Genius, his assistant, and Joe and Harvey convince Johnson to buy a radio that they inserted a scrambler into, claiming it had hidden knowledge from the fourth dimension. This whole time, Johnson acts as though he doesn\u2019t have any interest in things he wants to buy, for as long as he can maintain that appearance. However, Joe and Harvey will often get him interested by the end, with Johnson becoming upset when he can\u2019t have what he wants. In the end, it turns out Genius can\u2019t actually leave Planetoid 42, because he would be crushed by a larger planet\u2019s gravity, and Joe and Harvey leave somewhat dejected, hoping that they managed to make some amount of money from the whole ordeal. It turns out they broke exactly even, so they had a good laugh of frustration and went on to Mars to try another plan.\n\n"

Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're\nright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus.

The figure, 750, with the bucko sign\nin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping\na faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to\ninvestigate.\n  \n \n  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound\nthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.\n  \n \n  \"What's this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had\nto transport water in pails.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"It leads\n   \n   to\n   \n  the saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the\npipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it\nleads\n   \n   from\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of\nscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst\ninto the open\u2014before a clear, sparkling pool.\n  \n \n  Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.\n  \n \n  \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.\n  \n \n  But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and\ntasting it.\n  \n \n  \"Sweet!\" he snarled.\n  \n \n  They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.\nHis mouth went wry. \"Bitter!

Now you can meet my son, Jed.\nHim and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed.\n  \n \n  Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair\nand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been\nborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have\nkept him down near the general dimensions of a man.\n  \n \n  He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own\nhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when\nhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed\none.\n  \n \n  \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense\natmosphere.\n  \n \n  The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and\nunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....\n  \n \n  \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n  \n \n  Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were\ngently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features\ndrooping like a bloodhound's.\n  \n \n  \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming\ndown with asteroid fever!\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\nof the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean,\n   \n   once\n   \n  ?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\nevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\nout of here!\"\n  \n \n  \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then he'll be here for months!\"\n  \n \n  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\nhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\nin tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\n  \n \n  \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\nfrantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\ncups\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\nrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\n  \n \n  Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\nrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\nfew minutes, carrying a bottle.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Harvey and Joe are business partners and conmen. Although they are both important players in their various ruses, Harvey is definitely the brains behind the operation. Joe is willing to listen to Harvey\u2019s instructions and play along in order to get money out of their victims. However, he is also a bit more hot-headed than his partner, and it\u2019s up to Harvey to calm Joe down when he gets flustered because they are taken advantage of. When Joe finds out about the sweet water that Johnson lied about, he is instantly irate. Later, when Johnson tricks them into ordering loads of food at his restaurant, Joe is furious and threatens not to pay the bill. In both instances, Harvey recognizes that the pair was fooled fair and square and all they can do is accept the loss. \n\nIt is obvious that the two have been working together for a long time because they are able to communicate using very few words and gestures. They both know their playbook of tricks, and it is easy for each of the men to tip the other off to their thoughts. After meeting Genius, Harvey and Joe immediately agree that they should try and acquire the creature. Both men are money-minded and they see dollar signs when they lay their eyes on an alien as peculiar as him. When the duo wants to sell their medicine, Joe pretends to come down with symptoms of asteroid fever, and Harvey doesn\u2019t miss a beat. Within moments he asks Joe if he\u2019s feeling okay and goes to fetch the fake panacea that they peddle. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Harvey and Joe are conmen and partners. They work together to deceive and swindle people out of their money using various schemes. Harvey is a fast-talker and smooth operator. Joe is more emotionally charged and tends to complain to Harvey often about the state of affairs they find themselves in. Joe often questions Harvey's approach but falls in line in order to execute his plan.  Even though they work well together, they also fall prey to the deceptions that are set up by Johnson.",
        "Summary_3": "Harvey and Joe are colleagues and friends. They work together as solar salesmen, who con people by selling them their fake cure for all ailments. Their experience together makes them very effective conmen. \n\tIt\u2019s clear through their rapport and previously devised tricks that they have been working together for a long time. When Joe feigned being sick to sell the medicine, Harvey guided Johnson along with them and convinced him entirely of the medicine\u2019s success.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Harvey Ellsworth and Joe Mallon have very complementary personalities: when we meet them, they show us that Harvey is the levelheaded one who tries to see the best in people, but Joe is much more reactive and has less of a performative air to his demeanor. They know each other quite well, enough that they are able to communicate with each other discreetly to give each other direction while trying to run a con. Harvey is the one who holds on to hope in an interesting sense: he is able to take previous experiences to formulate plans for current predicaments, in a way that means he is not easily rattled. This presents itself in Harvey acting as sort of a leader of the duo, and Harvey comes up with plans and directs Joe as needed. Harvey steers a lot of the conversations they have with others, and when it\u2019s just the two of them, Harry spends a lot of time scolding Joe for his attitude. Even though Harvey tries to see the best in Johnson at the beginning of the story, he eventually agrees with Joe\u2019s anger once they realize that Johnson did not need to purify the water that he had sold them. However, whereas Joe was angry at the treatment they were receiving, Harvey more directly wanted revenge. In the end, when they leave Planetoid 42, we see them connect about their history again, excited to run another con together."

We were,\nafter all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more\nI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty\nredsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly\nand asked: \"Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Harvey explained. \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much did it cost us?\"\n  \n \n  Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're\nright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after\nall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\"\n  \n \n  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on\nMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Goldbricks!\n   \n  \" Harvey said succinctly.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>  ACID BATH\n  \n \n  By VASELEOS GARSON\n  \n \n \n \n    The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments\nin his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid.

        "Summary_1": "Genius is an important character because he is used to illustrate just how brilliant Johnson is. The man is clearly intelligent because he has positioned himself as the sheriff, the barman, and the mayor of Planetoid 42. He also makes money by fooling gullible outsiders into paying high prices for water and food. However, his idea to sell Genius over and over again is perhaps the most shrewd. His asking price for the remarkable creature is in the 600s, much more than he\u2019s able to charge for water or dishes at his restaurant. Johnson pretends that he\u2019s attached to Genius and would hate to see him go, yet he cannot turn down the incredible sum of money. \n\nEach time Genius is sold to naive buyers, he ends up making his way right back to Johnson\u2019s bar, and Johnson profits all of the money. Genius cannot leave the planet because the pressure in other habitats is too much for his unique body to handle. If one of the buyers insisted on bringing him aboard their ship, he would turn up dead and useless to them anyway. Therefore, they always send the poor creature back to Johnson and lose out on their plans to make loads of money off of him. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Genius is an alien being with 6 arms. He serves Johnson on Planetoid 42 as an all-around servant. He is coveted by and eventually purchased by Harvey and Joe to be exploited for profit off world. Unfortunately for the pair, after his purchase Genius explains that he cannot leave the planet because the higher atmospheric pressure of an off world environment would kill him. Johnson continually \"sells\" genius to unsuspecting visitors to the planet as a source of income only to have him return.",
        "Summary_3": "Genius is the many-armed native that works for Johnson and his son. His 30 fingers and dexterous abilities make him a hot commodity to Harvey and Joe. After they watch him bartend, using some hands to pour glasses, other to sweep the floor, and even more to complete other duties, they start brainstorming all the ways he could be helpful onboard their ship. Or, on the other hand, how much they could get for him once he\u2019s sold. \nEventually, Harvey and Joe decide to make an offer on Genius. Johnson sells his worker for a little over half a thousand buckos. Despite selling him to Harvey and Joe, Johnson forgot to include one minute detail. Genius is unable to leave their small planet, due to the gravity he grew up on. Any bigger atmospheric pressure would crush him. \nGenius is yet another example of the many cons Johnson pulled on Harvey and Joe.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The character of Genius acts as a symbol of the things that visitors do not understand about Planetoid 42, and how Johnson uses this to his advantage when he tries to make money off of visitors. When humans first encounter him, Genius seems like an incredible and one-of-a-kind creature who fascinates the visitors, sometimes prompting them to want to take him to zoo. Johnson uses this to his advantage to set a trap, and allows visitors to buy Genius off of him before they realize that Genius can\u2019t actually leave the planetoid. Not only does he look interesting, but he is also very talented and uses his six hands to accomplish many tasks at once. He is able to carry boxes while cleaning, and makes for an incredible waiter as he is able to play instruments while serving food. Johnson has to rely on the idea that the visitors will not think about Genius\u2019 inability to adapt to other planets\u2019 environments, and focus only on his uniqueness. Genius also represents how Johnson leaves out small pieces of information in strategic places. For instance, there is no reason to assume that Genius is able to speak based on the majority of the story, but once he arrived at Joe and Harvey\u2019s ship he explains to them that he cannot go with them. It seems he is a piece of Johnson\u2019s plot, as his assistant, as opposed to being more of an independent character who makes his own decisions, but there is not enough information to say for sure."

Something shrewd was called for....\n  \n \n  \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n  \n \n  Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were\ngently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features\ndrooping like a bloodhound's.\n  \n \n  \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming\ndown with asteroid fever!\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\nof the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean,\n   \n   once\n   \n  ?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\nevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\nout of here!\"\n  \n \n  \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then he'll be here for months!\"\n  \n \n  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\nhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\nin tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\n  \n \n  \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\nfrantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\ncups\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\nrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\n  \n \n  Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\nrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\nfew minutes, carrying a bottle.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Joe and Harvey are professional conmen, so they are quite good at swindling innocent victims. They make their money by peddling a fake panacea called La-anago Yergis. The men regularly partake in an act where Joe falls ill and Harvey has to come to his rescue with the extract. Although Johnson falls for this trick and purchases an entire case of the medicine, he also does a great job of getting Harvey and Joe back. At the end of the story, the opposing sides come out basically even in terms of financial gains. \n\nJohnson first demonstrates that he can take advantage of Harvey and Joe when he gives them each eight glasses of water before letting them know that he charges a lot for each glass. The men say they\u2019re thirsty, so he is happy to give them as much as they\u2019d like to drink. Although Johnson says that the water costs so much because it must be specially purified, the truth is that he has access to an entire body of water and there really isn\u2019t any reason to charge so much.\n\nLater, Johnson convinces Harvey and Joe that they\u2019re hungry enough to sit down at his restaurant even though neither one had even mentioned food. He allows them to order their food and believe that they\u2019re getting an incredible deal until he tells them about the fine print on the menu. Harvey and Joe are forced to fork over hundreds of dollars for their meal, and when they threaten to walk out, Johnson reminds them that he is the sheriff on Planetoid 42, and he has the power to arrest them. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Johnson has a number of schemes that he uses to swindle Harvey and Joe. He initially charges them for water that he claims is expensively purified when in fact it is naturally drinkable. He overcharges them for a meal using a menu with ludicrously fine print. Finally he sells them Genius even though they can't take him off world. In the end Johnson proves that he is just a good a grifter as Harvey and Joe because he manages to extract exactly as much money out of the pair as they do out of him.",
        "Summary_3": "Joe and Harvey arrive on this planet in need of water for their ship and in the hopes that they will be able to make a profit off of it. From the get-go, we know that these men are scheming cons, but Johnson is the first to make a move. He cons them into paying more for the water than was necessary and from there the battle only grows. \nWith every con Joe and Harvey pull, Johnson is right back with them. Although they may stump him in the end with the ingenious radio that picks up the fourth dimension, he got the last laugh what with Genius being unable to leave. \nAs well, when Joe and Harvey count their money in the end, they realize they\u2019re leaving with the same amount they arrived with. Johnson was not only a formidable foe but possibly their equal in terms of scheming qualities.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Throughout the story, the two groups of people (Joe and Harvey, the travelers, and Johnson and Genius, the locals) are constantly trying to trick one another in ways that the others do not see coming. Joe and Harvey think that they are excellent conmen; they say they are salesman who are traveling, but show throughout the story that they are the type to find the best deal for themselves in any way possible. Johnson, the man who runs the bar and the legal system on Planetoid 42, is ready to rise to the occasion. In fact, at the end of the story, they break even and neither side has actually gained any money. Whenever Joe and Harvey are trying to pull one of their scams, Johnson maintains an uninterested air and tries to not give away any interest in anything the visitors may have to sell him. He always acts as if he needs to be convinced by something, and does not let on what he is trying to pull something over on Joe and Harvey. He also finds very sneaky ways of getting money from them, playing on the visitors\u2019 limited knowledge of the planetoid and its environment. This is how he originally sells them on the idea that he has to charge for water, but it is not his only tactic. He presents them with a menu that has very inexpensive prices for food, but does not mention the extremely small print on the bottom of the menu that shows an exorbitant service charge for the entertainment. These types of ploys have something in common: he tries to set up a situation to make it look very normal for his environment on the planetoid, but hides the information necessary for visitors to make an informed decision. This includes selling Genius near the end of the story, which is a con he has apparently run many times. Because he expects visitors to not think about the biology of the creatures who live on the planetoid, he is able to sell the flashy exterior, in this case his assistant\u2019s capabilities, while there is always a hidden piece of information underneath."

But never had\nthey seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.\n  \n \n  Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two\nhands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the\nremaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish\nHarvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this\nimpossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit\njuice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense,\" Harvey croaked uncertainly. \"We have seen enough queer\nthings to know there are always more.\"\n  \n \n  He led the way inside.

Joe gulped. \"That\u2014that's robbery!\" the lanky man\nmanaged to get out in a thin quaver.\n  \n \n  The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain't many customers, you gotta\nmake more on each one.

Nevertheless,\nit was a garden.\n  \n \n  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\n  \n \n  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\"\nhe admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\n  \n \n  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign.

They discover abundant highly developed life forms including a small location of sentient life, possibly of extraordinary magnitude. \n\nThey descend to the moon\u2019s surface near the location of the sentient life. They discover a multitude of plants and animals that are found on Earth, also finding two individuals that appear to be human, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah.\n\nTheir investigation of the surroundings bears a startling resemblance to the biblical story of Genesis. The crew is bewildered to consider that this may indeed be a new Garden of Eden which never fell into sin and was preserved as a perfect paradise.\n\nAfter remaining for a few days, the crew returns to their probe. They remark how immoral it would be to meddle such an unspoiled paradise, but nevertheless begin the process of advertising the world to potential colonizers who would indeed exploit the moon for profit.\n\nSurprisingly, it is revealed that back on the planet that the individuals that were merely posing as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah working with their boss, Snake-oil Sam, to deceive potential colonists, ambushing them upon arrival and confiscating their valuable supplies and equipment.\n\nBack on the probe Father Briton chides the rest of the crew that they had been taken in by an obvious ruse and to inform any potential colonists to prepare for armed resistance. The incredulous crew demands to know the reasoning behind his conclusion.

The man explains that he is able to speak whatever language his listener needs to hear in order to understand, and this includes animals like eagles and squirrels. \n\nStark then asks the mostly naked man if there are other humans on the moon. Adam says there cannot be more than one of anything. He then names each member of the crew something different and explains that they cannot be people because the man and woman themselves are people.\n\nThe crew members consume fruit from the garden and are incredibly surprised at their quality. The produce tastes better than anything they have ever eaten on earth. They begin to make the connections between this place and the Garden of Eden, and they wonder if they are dreaming. The man tells Langweilig he is not allowed to eat from the pomegranate tree, and the priest explains that in other languages, it is not the apple that is forbidden in the Garden of Eden, but the pomegranate. \n\nThe crew members continue to silently make comparisons to the Biblical story. Adam tells the men that he has heard about another world in which the people have fallen. He also explains that he has a preternatural intellect. In order to check his claims, the priest asks Adam to play checkers, but he refuses.\n\nThe crew members learn about the large serpent that lives in a nearby cave. Adam claims that if evil is to come to him, it will happen via the serpent. \n\nAfter leaving on their ship, all of the crew members are convinced that they have found an actual paradise, a place that has yet to be touched and has not yet fallen.

The woman on the surface, Hawwah, does not speak while the crew is there. These two are the only humanoids that the crew notices, and they find that the bright light seems to be coming from the people themselves. The main features on the surface are a large garden and a fountain, and the crew is struck by the resemblance to the biblical story of Adam and Eve. They test the boundaries of the similarities by asking to eat apples, which they are told is fine, but then find that pomegranates are not allowed to be consumed. This does not discount the similarity, as some versions of the story say that pomegranates were the forbidden fruit, and the crew is even more baffled when they hear that there is a serpent there that is the source of evil: they do not meet him, as he is in a cave. After three days on the surface, with Father Briton asking questions all the while, the crew goes back to the Little Prob where they discuss what they had witnessed. Stark was astounded at the purity of the world, and thought it needed to be protected, as did Steiner. Craig, the tycoon who owns 51% of the probe, admitted it was beautiful and would be terrible to ruin, but immediately works on dictating a message to Gilbert, the executive officer, advertising the moon to those who might want to buy or lease land there. On the surface, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah are meeting with the Old Serpent\u2014it turns out that the entire situation was a ploy to draw the humans in, and they regularly kill incoming settlers to take their supplies. Father Briton is the only one who is suspicious, and convinces the rest of the crew that they have to doubt what they had just experienced\u2014besides flaws in logic, he was surprised that his offer of a checkers game had been denied, as it would have been a chance for Ha-Adamah to show off.",

The reader comes back positive, so they move on to the next test. The eppel reports an orange light, meaning the possibility of something extraordinary, but perhaps not.The eppel (the Extraordinary Perception Locator) was created with the intention to find the most extraordinary people, brains, or trains of thought.  \n\tStark, the captain, takes charge and demands they scan the rest of the planet for traces of infrastructure. He sends the rest of the crew to bed, and when they wake up the next morning, the report is back. Negative. They target the possibility of something extraordinary, as reported by the eppel, and make their way to the surface. \n\tAs they land, they take note of their surroundings. No shelters, buildings, or lean-tos. Just land with a lion and a lamb. They spot two people, neither naked nor clothed but bathed in light, and ask Father Briton, the Jesuit priest and resident linguist, to communicate with them. \n\tHe approaches them, talking in English, and the man, Ha-Adamah, replies. He introduces himself and the woman, named Hawwah. Father Briton asks him a few questions about their surroundings and names, and the Man responds with convoluted answers. He points the crew towards the fountain, so they may quench their thirst. Although hesitant at first, the men soon realize this water is the best they\u2019ve ever had: the freshest, bubbliest, and clearest. Their suspicions about this place and the Man and Woman only grow. \n\tThe Captain attempts to question Ha-Adamah, and his answers confirm their suspicions. This place might be Paradise or Eden, the place where humanity was born and disgraced. Ha-Adamah welcomes them and offers the fruit on the trees to eat, except for the pomegranates. Ha-Adamah reveals that he is happy here, but that he has been warned that he may lose this happiness and lead the rest of his life desperately trying to find it again. The Man also shies away from the cave where he says the great and evil serpent lives. The crew, now convinced, leave this land and call it in. Selling it as paradise perfect for ranching, farming, camping, or other industrial uses, they plot their return with settlers to take over the land. Only Father Briton believes paradise is not paradise at all, simply a trick. \n\tThe story flashes back to the surface, where Hawwah and Ha-Adamah are huddling with the Serpent, Snake-Oil Sam. It is revealed that they pretend to be Adam and Eve to draw in settlers, only to steal their equipment and kill them. The Serpent congratulates them on their work, but reminds them that more is to be done in order to farm this new world and get all the equipment they need. \n\tOn the spaceship, Father Briton asks for an armed escort to accompany them.

Briton, priest, linguist, and checkers afficionado. Stark is the leader of the group, commanding the others to their various tasks. Craig is shown to be a shrewd entrepreneur who is most intent on reaping potential profit from the situation they find themselves in.\n\nOn the moon lives Ha-Adamah and Hawwah who present themselves as archetypes of the biblical Adam and Eve. In reality, they are settlers, attempting to gather supplies to farm this world by stealing supplies from other settlers that they entice to world and then ambush. They are commanded by Snake-Oil Sam, a cynical, former showbusiness professional who runs the con.\n\nThe two groups interact when the crew descends to the surface of the moon. Ha-Adamah describes his environment in casual but bewildering terms to his visitors. Briton, as a Catholic priest, is designated by the crew to be Ha-Adamah\u2019s main interlocutor. Hawwah, notedly does not speak at all\u2014a flourish to attempt to further depict the attractiveness of the world to their all-male visitors. The crew beside Briton are enamored by the environment of the moon and are totally taken in by the performance of their hosts. The story concludes with Briton chiding his crewmates for their gullibility. Although Briton perhaps had the most reason to believe the moon was divinely ordained, he saw through the charade without much difficulty.",

The crew members who land on the new world represent one group, and Adam, Eve, and Snake-Oil Sam represent the other. The second group is nearly able to convince the first group that the moon is an untouched world, almost identical to the Garden of Eden. The crew members spend several days with Adam and Eve, and their elaborate ruse convinces them that Adam and Eve know nothing of death or suffering or ageing. It is only the priest that recognizes that the entire interaction was a con. \n\nAs soon as the crew members leave, Snake-Oil Sam comes out of his cave to give Adam and Eve more directions. He is in charge of the entire sham, and he gives out orders. Sam recognizes that people simply can\u2019t resist ruining something that appears to be perfect. He has played this game before, and he knows that the crew members will be back with others to try and take over what they see as a paradise. Instead, he will murder them and take their goods to use for his own advantage. \n",

The crew consists of six Americans: Stark is the ship\u2019s captain, so he calls all of shots onboard and asks a lot of questions on the surface. Steiner is his right-hand man, who tends to follow what Stark says and runs a lot of scans. Gilbert is the executive officer, who points out that they have to eat an apple to truly test if this reality is indeed the biblical paradise it appears to be, and Langweilig is the ship\u2019s engineer. Craig is the tycoon who owns most of the ship, and wants to rent out land on the moon, and Briton is the priest and linguist who initiates contact on the surface and remains a skeptic throughout the story, eventually convincing the rest of the crew that the whole thing is a trap. On the surface, there are three characters of interest: the Old Serpent, who the reader finds out at the end of the story is in charge of the deception, and the two people known as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah. Ha-Adamah, or Adam, is the one who interacts with the ship\u2019s crew when they visit the surface, and Hawwah, or Eve, does not talk to them while they are there\u2014she does talk, though, and works on the plan with the serpent at the end. It is the serpent who creates the paint that makes Adam and Eve glow as if they are sources of light themselves, and writes the script for the deception.",

Each man serves his own purpose on board their ship. Based on their friendliness and camaraderie, these men have worked together before. Finding paradise was not their first mission. Although Stark is the captain, he often asks favors from Father Briton, the advanced linguist. In commanding him and letting him work, Stark is showing his complete trust in his crew. \n\tHowever, the group of creatures on Paradise interact a little differently. As Father Briton mentions later in the story, it\u2019s clear that there was a powerful Thought (mind or being) on the planet, it just didn\u2019t reveal itself to them. The Serpent, or Snake-Oil Sam, hides out in a cave with the equipment, money, ships, and bone meal that they have stolen from previous settlers. He is the true brains behind the operation. He has Ha-Adamah and Hawwah under his command, and, though they complain about the itchy costume, they are on board with his plan. He is clearly in charge and more manipulative than Captain Stark. \n\tAs the Serpent and his crew act out paradise, Captain Stark and his crew fall for it. All except for Father Briton. But the others don\u2019t listen to him. They only laugh off his ideas and request for an armed escort. \n"

        "Summary_1": "Christianity is a central component of the story. The heart of the narrative revolves around the description of the world as a replica of the biblical Garden of Eden. The author goes into extensive detail regarding the aspects of the garden and its inhabitants and how they conform to aspects of the Genesis narrative and how it was understood by religious analysis. It is heavily suggested that here, the Serpent did not succeed in convincing man to sin and fall from grace as was the case in the biblical narrative. As a result, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah (the Hebrew names for Adam and Eve) remain clothed in light and still enjoy the preternatural gifts of creation including a highly advanced intellect, immortality and even an illuminated appearance.\n\nIt is revealed that this depiction is a deception on the part of the moon\u2019s inhabitants. Interestingly, the 4 non-believers on the crew are the most ready to believe that the state of affairs on the planet is indeed supernatural. It is only the clever priest who possesses faith, but employs the skepticism necessary to see through the fraud.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Snake-Oil Sam, the mastermind behind the ruse, realizes that the visitors who come to the new world will immediately make connections to the Garden of Eden if there are enough clues to point them in that direction. In that way, the story demonstrates that people are susceptible to believing in an already established story or trope, regardless of how impossible it seems. Since the settlers are familiar with the Bible and the famous story of Adam and Eve, they are preconditioned to believe that another Adam and Eve may exist in a separate world, a world that has yet to be tainted with sin. \n\nThe priest is the only character that sees through Adam and Eve\u2019s show. Although it\u2019s strange that the religious man in the group would be the most skeptical, it\u2019s clear that he has a keen eye for details. He purposefully asks Adam to play checkers with him to test his supernatural intellect, and when Adam refuses, he realizes that he cannot be who he says he is. Perhaps the priest has the most to lose in believing in this illusion, so his refusal to take the con artists at their word shows his true dedication to Christianity. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The people on the surface of the moon that the crew of the Little Probe is investigating are part of a very detailed ploy to replicate the biblical story of Adam and Eve. This religious story served as a recognizable type of paradise, which the serpent used to his advantage, knowing that humans would be drawn to something that they thought was perfect. All of the details of the facade were carefully designed around an attempt to make an authentic, tempting environment. This included changing some details from the English-translated version of the biblical story, including giving the people their Hebrew names of Ha Adamah and Hawwah. The other major point of religion in the story is the Jesuit priest who is onboard the Little Probe. It is Father Briton who is the skeptic, asking questions during his stay on the surface to try to uncover the truth of the situation. The rest of the crew are surprised that it is the religious man who is skeptical of the reality of the moon, but he convinces them that he is right, having thought carefully about every detail of every interaction they had on the surface.",
        "Summary_4": "\tThe story of Adam and Eve (or Genesis) is one of the most widely known myths. The idea that we, as humans, once inhabited Paradise, but lost it due to our greed and stolen innocence is intoxicating. It explains why life isn\u2019t perfect, why things don\u2019t always go our way, and why people die. \n\tIn In the Garden, this story is explored in a different manner. The Christian origin story acts as a backdrop for this uninhabited planet that a crew visits. After exploring, they are quick to believe that they have discovered another universe\u2019s Eden. And, therefore, quick to destroy it. \n\tTheir religious faith and belief in the story of Adam and Eve adds to the gravity of the situation. If this weren\u2019t a well-known story, then the crew would have been less amazed by the space before them.

        "Summary_1": "Human sinfulness and its collective fall from grace are referenced in several ways in the story. Ha-Adamah contrasts his world\u2019s perfection with the fallenness that is apparent in the visitors. He claims to be free from the stain of original sin. He presents himself as perfectly happy and not subject to corruption, aging, or death. This is contrasted with Earth's humanity which was fated to \u201close that happiness, and then to seek it vainly through all the ages.\u201d\n\nThe entire crew of the Little Probe agree on the unacceptability of spoiling a pristine world. Even so, they irresistibly and almost gleefully prepare to exploit the world\u2019s riches.\n\nSnake-Oil Sam expounds upon this inclination. He claims that on top of the very real greed of the visitors they\u2019ve deceived over the years, they are capitalizing on the human desire to despoil the unspoiled. This is a clear summation of concupiscence\u2014the inclination for fallen humanity to tend toward sin. It is clear that Sam and his associates are just as fallen as the other individuals in the story, preying on others to further their own goals.",
        "Summary_2": "Although the visiting crew members are impressed and in awe of the Garden of Eden, they have every intention of pillaging the place. They love the clean and delicious water it offers and the tasty fruit that is better than anything they\u2019ve had before. Yet, they cannot resist their urge to take over the land and commercialize it. They do not care that their actions will ruin the purity of the land and its two occupants. They are greedy and only want what will benefit them in the end. \n\nLikewise, Snake-Oil Sam recognizes the immense beauty of the untouched world, and instead of trying to preserve it, he entices groups of people to come and try to take it over so that he can murder them and take their goods and equipment. Snake-Oil Sam is cunning because he innately knows that if he can convince settlers that this world is pure and special, they will immediately desire to destroy it. According to Sam, people can\u2019t resist ruining something that appears to be unique and unadulterated. He uses human nature and the desire to control to his own advantage. By convincing strangers that Adam and Eve are simple and kind and unaware of ageing or suffering, he knows that those strangers will return to the land to make sure that Adam and Eve learn all about those topics. They can\u2019t help themselves precisely because humans have already fallen and are predisposed to sinning. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Human fallenness can be interpreted as the degraded state of mankind, or as inauthenticity in human interaction. These are both important themes to this story. In terms of inauthenticity, this is the root of the interactions on the surface of the moon. As the crew of the Little Probe is exploring the area where the two humanoids are living, everything they encounter is a carefully staged ploy. The two people on the surface do not let on any of the truth of their situation to the crew, and deliberately lie to them in order to entice them to come back to settle on the moon. This is ironic, as the serpent\u2019s plan for this ruse is heavily based on others\u2019 desires for authenticity in the story they are presented, thus the small changes in various iterations of this illusion of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. In terms of degradation, another central idea is that this moon is a pure and untouched place. However, the serpent knows that this will entice humans to investigate and try to settle there, because of an innate draw to spoil things that are in perfect condition. The crew of the Little Probe recognize this idea in a different way, in that they see this moon as what humankind could have been before it fell, when Adam and Eve fell to temptation. They see this as innocence that would be a crime to ruin, and know that humans of their own world would be inclined to disrupt what was there.",
        "Summary_4": "\tThe story of Adam and Eve ends with human failure. Eve, or Hawwah, eats the apple/pomegranate that God told them not to eat. And so she is cursed with painful birth, toiling the land, and eventual return to dust, or death. Both she and Adam are expelled from Eden and their expulsion leads to the creation of other humans. There is no longer one Man or Woman. \n\tHowever in this story, the destruction of paradise is brought about by two separate groups. The Serpent\u2019s crew of actors and props creates a false paradise to lure people in and pillage them. This in itself is an example of human fallenness, failure, or expulsion from Eden. By extorting the idea of paradise and using it to harm others, the Serpent and his crew are fallen humans. \n\tAnd so are the crew of the visiting spaceship. After discovering so-called paradise, their first thought is to destroy it. Their tools are farming, building, and burning, but not preserving. Human greed is what led to the falling, and is also what led to the falling of these two crews. \n"

        "Query": "What is the journey to Brightside Crossing on Mercury like in the story \"Brightside Crossing\"?",
        "Article": "The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep>I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\nI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when\nWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,\nI think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\nI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n  \n \n  I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\nproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\nconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made\na hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was a\nterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n  \n \n  But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n  \n \n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  \n \n  I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  \n \n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n  \n \n  He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n  \n \n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, I mean\n   \n   real\n   \n  heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be\ndangerous, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\n  \n \n  I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\n  \n \n  He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?\nWhat have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\n   \n   nobody\u2019s\n   \n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n  \n \n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n   \n   how\n   \n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n  \n \n  I wanted to be along.\n  \n<doc-sep>We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\nwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\ncould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\nCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closest\napproach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part of\nthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n  \n \n  The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\nwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\nthat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\nsurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\nwas only half done\u2014we would still have to travel another\ntwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\nwas to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,\napproximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n  \n \n  That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\nseventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\nwhat terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\ntime-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\nthat.\n  \n \n  The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\ndown for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\nyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job of\ndragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course pretty\nclosely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\nIf there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore ahead\non foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJack\nand I were planning to change around. We figured he could\ntake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,\nJack?\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Does\nit make any difference?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flank\nPeter along with me. Right?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s going\nto do the advance scouting?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the lead\nBug light as possible.\u201d\n  \n \n  Mikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped down\nto the frame and wheels.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the\n   \n   advance\n   \n  work.\nYou need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014to\npick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort of\na hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\nahead?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major said\nsharply.\n  \n \n  \u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about\n   \n   detail\n   \n  work. We don\u2019t need to\nworry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults you\ncan\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the charts\ndown excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\nreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\nI can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\narea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\nThen\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. When\nwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\nmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\nclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\nalone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\ngave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.\nWe\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\nGot that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\nwe nodded, too.\n  \n \n  \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,\nlet\u2019s go.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019ll\nnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\nbreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\nfirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\nfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\nthe Twilight Lab.\n  \n \n  I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\nMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\ntaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\nStone dragged the sledges.\n  \n \n  Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\nthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\nash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\nthe first twenty miles.\n  \n \n  I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\nthe track the early research teams had made out into the edge\nof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019s\nlittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\nwere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\nbite.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the heat so much those first days out. We\n   \n   saw\n   \n  it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\ndegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\nthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\nsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\nsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n  \n \n  We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\ncame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\na light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\nThe sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\ndegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\nforward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,\nbulk gelatin, vitamins.\n  \n \n  The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\nwe\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\nWe were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\nand psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interesting\nreasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\nhappened to be so.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\neyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\nbut we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around looking\nat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\ntaste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothers\nfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n  \n \n  After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\nthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\nEarth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\nHuge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\nwith black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\nwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\ngases.\n  \n \n  It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\nthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\nhad ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\ntried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\nso it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\nthe hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\ncould throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\n  \n \n  Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\nbefore, except for that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold before\nand won. We\u2019d never fought heat like this and won. The only\nworse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\nitself.\n  \n \n  Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\nget us. That was the bargain.\n  \n \n  I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\nThe gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\nonto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\neast. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\non Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\ncones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\nsides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n  \n \n  We couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,\nsulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\nface of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\nrose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\nrubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\nfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\ndust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\nash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacherous\nsurface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.\n  \n \n  I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\nsag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\nfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\na halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\nlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\nuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\nwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\nat first.\n  \n \n  Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\nthink so, too.\n  \n \n  McIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\nHe talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\ndriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\nwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\nnow and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n  \n \n  Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\neach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, but\nI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\nenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n  \n \n  And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\nthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\nfilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\nconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\nend of an eight-hour trek.\n  \n \n  But it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver the\npenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\ndown a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\nroute and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\nheard a sharp cry through our earphones.\n  \n \n  I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and\nspotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\ntop of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\nthe gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\nhorrible pictures racing through our minds....\n  \n \n  We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\nand, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say.

        "Summary_1": "James Baron is planning a trek to Brightside Crossing on Mercury, a feat so far unaccomplished. Few had tried, and those that did died. All except for one. He is asked to wait at the Red Baron as someone wanted to see him at 8. He waits patiently and is rewarded with the company of Peter Claney, the man who made it back home. Claney instantly tells him to give up on the journey and stay on Earth. Baron asks for details about their trek and what went wrong, but Claney refuses to give him the details. Claney is an older man now with an epithelioma on his face. Although he came to warn him, he quickly learns that Baron may only listen if he hears the truth. So Claney recounts the story. \nMajor Tom Mikuta recruited Claney, Jack Stone, and Ted McIvers to join him. They were to adventure to the Brightside Crossing at perihelion, a more dangerous journey. Temperatures reached up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit at perihelion, but Mikuta was an all-or-nothing man. Stone arrived on Mercury first, soon followed by Mikuta and Claney. McIvers was the last to arrive and they left soon after with three Bugs and one tractor dragging the sledges. Stone was briefed by Sanderson, the head of the observatory, before they left, and the men pored over all images and maps of the Crossing before beginning. \nDespite their high-tech spacesuits and general gadgets, the giant sun still got to them. They were constantly thirsty and hot, and their skin itched and burned. They drove for eight hours, then slept for five. They needed to travel 70 miles a day. It would take 30 days to reach the Center, and then another 30 to reach the pick-up spot. The journey quickly took a toll on Stone, who was the most apprehensive of the bunch. He retreats into himself, while McIvers chatters nonstop to fill the silence. Tension grew among the crew, especially as McIvers put himself at risk by adventuring away from them. \nClaney lead the gang in his Bug, while McIvers and Mikuta flanked him. Stone was in the very back. If Claney saw something suspicious or unsafe, they would investigate on foot before continuing in their equipment. \nAs they travel, they got closer to the Sun, which appeared to be twice as big as it did on Earth. Several drives into their journey, McIvers discovered something truly terrible on one of his forrays. He screamed into the intercom, alerting the others who quickly rushed after him. He stood there, pointing below. There lay a broken, older Bug and two corpses. Wyatt and Carpenter, the original discoverers. \nThey continued on with disheartened spirits until Claney reached a cleft. There was no way to cross it, except for a very small and dangerous ledge. The cleft slowly began to crumble under their Bugs and they\u2019re left in a very precarious position. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is about a man, Baron, who is planning to cross the bright side of the planet Mercury. Right before the trip is about to depart he runs into one of the famous adventurers that attempted it before him, Peter Claney, at a bar called the Red Lion. Peter goes into a long recollection of his experience to Baron, which is interspersed with them snapping back to reality at the bar. \n\nPeter\u2019s attempted Brightside crossing involved a party of four: the Major (a trusted team captain of sorts), himself (who would be in the lead Bug of the expedition), McIver (who would flank one side of Peter along with the Major), and Stone (who would drag the sledges). They began the expedition at a place called the Twilight lab, an observatory for studying the sun run by a person called Sanders located in a 5 mile wide transition between the bright and dark sides of Mercury which had hospitable temperatures for humans to survive.\n\nOver the course of their journey, tensions between them grew tense. McIver started to drive on little side trips during their daily driving in the Bug vehicles. On one of his side trips he discovered the skeletons of the last known explorers that came before them - Wyatt and Carpenter. Peter does not finish recounting his tale before the story closes, but the reader knows he never did successfully make the crossing, although he did survive (because he is presently sitting in the bar with Baron and recalling this tale from the past).\n\nIt is revealed that Peter\u2019s expedition party went beyond the farthest known point explored by humans (due to finding the bodies), and that he thinks a couple of mistakes were made in equipment choices and in not having a person driving several miles ahead to scout the terrain before the entire convoy had to drive through it.\n",
        "Summary_3": "An explorer named James Baron waits irritatedly for a stranger in the Red Lion, a bar in New York. The stranger turns out to be another explorer, Peter Claney, whom Baron has been attempting to contact to get the details of Claney\u2019s previous mission to Mercury\u2019s Brightside, as he is the only man on Earth to have survived and attempt to cross the Brightside, and Baron plans to attempt it soon himself. Claney says it can\u2019t be done, and that he\u2019ll tell Baron his story to prove it to him. The rest of the passage takes place within Claney\u2019s story. \n\nClaney tells of his desire since childhood to attempt the journey, and how he met Major Mikuta, who wants to attempt it. Claney joins Mikuta, along with a young acolyte of the Major\u2019s, Jack Stone, and an impetuous, thrill-seeking climber named Ted McIvers. The addition of McIvers to the team is an unwelcome surprise to Claney, and he proves to be headstrong and restless. \n\nThe team plans and strategizes at Twilight Lab at Mercury\u2019s north pole. They set out on their journey with Claney out front and in charge of finding safe passage routes, Mikuta and McIvers flanking him on either side, and Stone pulling the sledges in the rear. They were state-of-the-art protective equipment and travel in \u201cbug\u201d vehicles, but the terrain and atmosphere are treacherous. They grow more anxious as they go, with McIvers driving the rest of the crew nuts with his constant talking and wandering, and Stone growing more quiet and reserved. Their nerves are further troubled by the discovery of two previous explorers\u2019 corpses (the two explorers Claney had mentioned looking up to as a kid). \n\nAs the passage ends, Claney is in a precarious position at the edge of a chasm with only a thin, ramp-like surface that is already shifting as he watches and ponders how they\u2019ll cross. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Peter Claney shows up at the Red Lion to convince James Baron not to go on his trip to the Brightside Crossing. Baron has been trying to find Claney for months to learn about his attempt at crossing the Brightside. Claney is the only person on earth who has attempted the ordeal and made it out alive, but Claney says that it simply cannot be done. It\u2019s impossible. \n\nClaney explains that a major named Tom Mikuta recruited him to go on the trip. Major wanted to cross the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion, except he wanted to cross the entire surface of the planet. Claney admits he was afraid because he knew the story of the last two explorers who never returned from their trip. He is also fully aware that the only place hotter than the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion is the actual surface of the sun. Claney believes that it can be done, and he agrees to join Major\u2019s team of men. \n\nMajor and Claney meet up at The Twilight Lab, which is near the north pole of Mercury. Jack Stone, another member of the team, arrives with supplies and equipment. Claney is upset to learn that McIvers will also be joining the team. He thinks he is too much of a risk-taker. The men discuss Mercury\u2019s atmosphere, and Claney realizes that there\u2019s no way to prepare for a voyage this mysterious. There will be active volcanoes, but they have no idea where they will find them. McIvers finally shows up, and although he\u2019s late, Major doesn\u2019t make an issue of it.\n\nThe team leaves the lab with a plan to reach the Center of Brightside in 30 days. They need to travel 70 miles per day. McIvers wants to know who will be out four or five miles ahead of the pack to evaluate the surface. Major sternly tells him that isn\u2019t part of the plan - all team members will stay in sight of one another.\n\nBack at Red Lion, Claney tells Baron that the heat was unbearable, even when their suits kept them cool at 70 degrees. The sight of the sun tricked their minds into believing they were melting. The team drives for eight hours and then stops and sleeps for five. Most of the time, the men are unable to get any rest. The only thing that propels them forward is the fact that no one had ever succeeded before.\nClaney crosses Mercury\u2019s difficult terrain, which includes mounds of dust and impassable cracks. At one point, McIvers drives down a long canyon. Claney sees that McIvers is waving to get his attention, so he follows his lead. McIvers finds wrecked vehicles; this is the spot where the two explorers died. Claney begins to experience difficulties with his Bug. He comes to a six foot drop that his vehicle cannot pass over. He sees a narrow ledge that resembles a ramp. \n"

        "Query": "What is the role of McIvers in the story \"Brightside Crossing\" and how does his behavior affect the crew's journey?",
        "Article": "We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\nwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\ncould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\nCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closest\napproach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part of\nthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n  \n \n  The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\nwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\nthat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\nsurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\nwas only half done\u2014we would still have to travel another\ntwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\nwas to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,\napproximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n  \n \n  That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\nseventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\nwhat terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\ntime-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\nthat.\n  \n \n  The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\ndown for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\nyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job of\ndragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course pretty\nclosely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\nIf there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore ahead\non foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJack\nand I were planning to change around. We figured he could\ntake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,\nJack?\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Does\nit make any difference?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flank\nPeter along with me. Right?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s going\nto do the advance scouting?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the lead\nBug light as possible.\u201d\n  \n \n  Mikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped down\nto the frame and wheels.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the\n   \n   advance\n   \n  work.\nYou need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014to\npick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort of\na hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\nahead?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major said\nsharply.\n  \n \n  \u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about\n   \n   detail\n   \n  work. We don\u2019t need to\nworry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults you\ncan\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the charts\ndown excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\nreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\nI can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\narea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\nThen\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. When\nwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\nmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\nclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\nalone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\ngave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.\nWe\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\nGot that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\nwe nodded, too.\n  \n \n  \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,\nlet\u2019s go.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019ll\nnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\nbreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\nfirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\nfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\nthe Twilight Lab.\n  \n \n  I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\nMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\ntaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\nStone dragged the sledges.\n  \n \n  Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\nthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\nash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\nthe first twenty miles.\n  \n \n  I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\nthe track the early research teams had made out into the edge\nof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019s\nlittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\nwere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\nbite.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the heat so much those first days out. We\n   \n   saw\n   \n  it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\ndegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\nthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\nsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\nsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n  \n \n  We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\ncame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\na light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\nThe sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\ndegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\nforward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,\nbulk gelatin, vitamins.\n  \n \n  The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\nwe\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\nWe were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\nand psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interesting\nreasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\nhappened to be so.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\neyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\nbut we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around looking\nat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\ntaste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothers\nfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n  \n \n  After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\nthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\nEarth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\nHuge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\nwith black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\nwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\ngases.\n  \n \n  It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\nthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it.

Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\nfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\ndust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\nash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacherous\nsurface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.\n  \n \n  I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\nsag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\nfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\na halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\nlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\nuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\nwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\nat first.\n  \n \n  Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\nthink so, too.\n  \n \n  McIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\nHe talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\ndriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\nwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\nnow and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n  \n \n  Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\neach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, but\nI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\nenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n  \n \n  And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\nthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\nfilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\nconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\nend of an eight-hour trek.\n  \n \n  But it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver the\npenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\ndown a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\nroute and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\nheard a sharp cry through our earphones.\n  \n \n  I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and\nspotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\ntop of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\nthe gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\nhorrible pictures racing through our minds....\n  \n \n  We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\nand, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreck\nof a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that\nhadn\u2019t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in\nthe rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the\nmiddle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were\ntwo insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the\nfiberglass helmets.\n  \n \n  This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on\n   \n   their\n   \n  Brightside Crossing.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\nI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when\nWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,\nI think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\nI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n  \n \n  I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\nproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\nconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made\na hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was a\nterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n  \n \n  But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n  \n \n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  \n \n  I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  \n \n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n  \n \n  He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n  \n \n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, I mean\n   \n   real\n   \n  heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right.

Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\n   \n   nobody\u2019s\n   \n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n  \n \n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n   \n   how\n   \n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n  \n \n  I wanted to be along.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "From the get-go, Claney is clear in his obvious mistrust of McIvers and his preceding reputation. Late to Mercury, he arrives ready to explore. With long, gray hair and paradoxically drowsy yet alert eyes, McIvers\u2019 constant movement and chatter get on his colleague\u2019s nerves. McIvers is a famous climber known for pushing the boundaries and being a daredevil. \nAfter his arrival on Mercury, he and the crew soon set out for their treacherous journey to the Brightside Crossing. He switches spots with Stone, so he would have control of a Bug. He also asks to explore four or five miles ahead of the rest of the crew to see if it\u2019s dangerous footing ahead. Mikuta quickly shuts him down. McIvers talks nonstop through the intercoms or when they\u2019re supposed to be resting. As well, he disobeys Mikuta\u2019s orders and occasionally drifts off from the rest of the group, discovering things as he goes. He never drifts far enough to receive any real punishment, though he does get farther away every time. \nDuring one of his side-explorations, he discovers a wrecked Bug and two corpses belonging to Wyatt and Carpenter, the previous explorers of the Brightside Crossing. With this shocking find, he returns to the crew in silence. ",
        "Summary_2": "McIvers had a reputation in the climbing world for being both skilled and lucky, and the Major sought him out for the Brightside Crossing he was leading because he thought his skills would be useful. They had never met prior to this trip together, though they had spoken about the intent of the trip and that there would be no fooling around. The Major lets it slide that McIver shows up late, however, he does not approve of McIver\u2019s plan to go ahead of the rest of the party to scout the terrain. This turns out to potentially be one of the big mistakes that foils their attempted crossing.\n\nDuring their crossing, tensions between the crew and McIver become frazzled because they are tired of McIver\u2019s talking and bad jokes. McIver irritates the crew by taking little side trips away from the rest of them as they try to make forward progress through the Brightside. During one of those trips, McIver makes a significant discovery of two skeletons of the last known explorers. It is not known whether he lives or dies at the close of the crossing attempt that Peter is recollecting.\n",
        "Summary_3": "McIvers is a climbing enthusiast who is known as something of a daredevil, and is described by Mikuta as possessing skill and luck. Claney describes him as tall, with long, wavy, prematurely graying hair and \u201cclimber\u2019s\u201d eyes that can look drowsy or suddenly very alert. He never stands still and is always speaking, moving, or doing something. He has been invited on the Brightside Crossing mission, unbeknownst to Peter Claney, by Major Mikuta. He casually shows up three days late, having missed the ship that Claney and Mikuta took and conned his way into a different route via Venus. On the eve of the mission, as plans are being doled out, he asserts that he thinks he and Jack Stone should switch roles and he should be given more leeway for movement. He asks if he can go several miles ahead of the rest to scout out the terrain, but Mikuta insists that they will all stay together. McIvers shows his hot temper during this exchange but ultimately agrees. He grows restless during the journey and annoys everyone with his constant talking and wandering. Because of his meandering, he is the first to encounter a chilling sight: the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, the first two explorers to attempt the Brightside Crossing. \n",
        "Summary_4": "McIvers is an excellent climber with long gray hair and sleepy eyes. He is fidgety and difficult to take seriously. \n\nMajor Tom Mikuta invites Ted McIvers to join the team on their mission to cross the Brightside of Mercury, and Peter Claney is immediately disappointed. McIvers has a reputation for being a daredevil, and Claney worries that he\u2019s incapable of taking the danger of the mission seriously. Major argues that McIvers is both lucky and skillful, and the team will need plenty of luck and skill on this difficult trip. He also explains that McIvers knows that fooling around is unacceptable. When Claney tells James Baron the story of his trip, Baron agrees that taking McIvers was a huge mistake. Claney tells him that actually, the equipment and the route were more worrisome than McIvers. \n\nMcIvers arrives late to The Twilight Lab, but Major doesn\u2019t chide him. He actually shows up on a freight rocket from Venus because he missed his original chance to get on the ship that Major and Claney took. Major, the leader of the pack, tells McIvers that he will be dragging the sledges, but McIvers tells his boss that he and Jack Stone have already decided to switch roles. He clearly has no issue with challenging authority, and he gets his way. However, McIvers also wants to know who will be miles ahead of the group scouting the terrain, and Major tells him that no one will take that role. Everyone is to remain in sight of one another. Later, Claney reveals that McIvers was right about this suggestion. It would have been incredibly helpful to have a scout out ahead so the team wasn\u2019t driving blind. \n\nMcIvers\u2019 constant talking really annoys Claney and perhaps the other team members as well. He tells the same stupid jokes over and over and repeatedly wishes he had a cold beer. He also begins to go further and further away from the rest of the group members. On one of these tangents, McIvers spots the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, two explorers who failed at their mission to cross The Brightside. \n"

        "Summary_1": "Brightside Crossing by Alan E. Nourse mostly takes place on the surface of Mercury.  The main characters begin in an observatory equipped to support human life as well as do research on the planet itself. However, they quickly move on in their journey to cross the Brightside at perihelion. Full of craters, gorges, and cracked land, the planet\u2019s surface is incredibly dangerous to travel on. Sulfurous, hot winds blow across the planet. Beyond the towering, rocky spears and jagged gorges lay yellow valleys and flatlands. The gas beneath the surface of the planet can cause volcanic-like eruptions. This gas can also imply rise up from the core and poison the atmosphere around it. Gray dust caused by years of erosion rested atop every surface. \nMercury is an incredibly hot planet, being the nearest to the sun, and the surface reflects that. ",
        "Summary_2": "The only \u2018real\u2019 setting is a bar called Red Lion where Baron and Peter are sitting together. All other settings are imagined through Peter\u2019s recalling of past events.\n\nPeter\u2019s story includes settings from the Twilight Lab (an observatory on Mercury in the twilight zone between the bright and dark sides of the planet), in vehicles called Bugs on the surface of Mercury as his expedition party tries to cross the Brightside, and in various inhospitable locations on the surface of the bright side of the planet, including molten lead lakes and volcanoes.\n\nThe surface of the planet Mercury that faces the sun is referred to as the Brightside. Crossing it is extremely difficult due to the environmental conditions. It is described that the bright side of mercury is always facing towards the light as it rotates around the sun, never having darkness over it. It is an extremely hot place (770F), known to have active volcanoes, and an atmosphere that is mostly CO2, nitrogen and heavier gases. Humans must wear specialized suits to keep their body temperature at 75F while on the Brightside. A journey from the twilight zone (the transition between the bright and dark sides of the planet) to the Center of the Brightside would take about 30 days.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The initial setting is on Earth, in New York, outside of and then inside of a bar called the Red Lion. It is a quiet and sparsely populated lounge where some other adventurers (Andean climbers, the person who had mapped a previous voyage for Baron) are in attendance. Peter Claney\u2019s story touches briefly on settings during his childhood (presumably somewhere on Earth), Mikuta\u2019s time on Mars, his time with Mikuta on Venus, and New York again, but the primary setting is Mercury. The first area of Mercury they encounter is the Twilight Lab, located near Mercury\u2019s north pole. This is the jumping off point for the mission, and includes a rocket landing, labs and quarters located deep in Mercury\u2019s crust, and a tower with a solar scope. Mercury\u2019s temperature is around -410 degrees F on the darkside and can reach 770 degrees on the brightside. The lab is located in a twilight zone between the two, which is about five miles wide at the pole and allows the area to be habitable. The brightside has ranges of craters, peaks, and faults; some ranges are inactive while others have volcanic activity and shifting below surface level. The atmosphere is as treacherous as the terrain, with Co2, nitrogen, traces of heavier gases, sulfur vapor, carbon disulfide, and sulfur dioxide flowing in constant atmospheric tides from the brightside to the darkside. The first thirty miles of the trek take them through fluffy volcanic ash and into virgin territory full of desolate gorges and intense heat. They see tall, jagged rocks, as well as the yellow, smoky plains below them. They venture closer and closer to the sun, and have to be increasingly cautious of the tenuous surface of Mercury. Based on Claney saying he was ten in 2082, the events Claney describes as well as his meeting with Baron likely occur in the 2100s (or later). \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins at Red Lion, a place with few patrons. A doorman is in charge of the comings and goings. Several climbers are conversing, including Andean climbers and the first man to cross the Vulcan Crater on Venus. \nClaney then dives into his story about his trip to cross the Brightside of Mercury. The men meet up for their trip at the Twilight Lab near the north pole of the planet. The lab has a rocket landing and a lab, and much of it is deep in the crust of the planet where it is cooler. There is also a tower that houses the Solar \u2018scope. Sanderson, the lab\u2019s manager, is a sun researcher, so his lab is located at the closest reasonable spot to the sun. Its position between the Brightside and the Darkside means that the temperatures only fluctuate about 50-60 degrees. \nMercury is situated on an axis, and the part that turns in faces the sun. This area, the perihelion, is the hottest place in the solar system besides the actual surface of the sun. Here, the temperatures soar to 770 degrees fahrenheit. The surface of Mercury is particularly treacherous. There are many active volcanoes, and the ground shifts frequently, creating cracks and craters that are difficult to see and impossible to cross. The gases present are also dangerous, including CO 2, nitrogen, sulfur vapor, and sulfur dioxide. There is liquid lead and boiling pools of sulfur. \nOn Mercury, the sun appears to be twice as big as it does on Earth. The planet only has 30% of the gravity that Earth does, and it is blanketed with gray ash. Huge cracks in the surface appear out of nowhere, and cliffs rise out of the land, and rocks and rubble and molten lead make driving treacherous. Everything is difficult to see because of the sulfur mist and the volcanic ash. Without filters and screens, humans would be instantly blinded by the light from the sun. \nThere is a deep gorge where the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, two famous explorers who attempted to cross The Brightside, lie.

But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "The Brightside Crossing is an undiscovered portion of Mercury. It is the closest planet to the sun, and the Brightside is the surface that is face-to-face with the surface of the sun most of the time, thanks to Mercury\u2019s quick orbit. It is an incredibly dangerous area of Mercury, with temperatures reaching up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit, possibly more. Because of the difficult atmosphere, the presence of dangerous gases, treacherous landscape, and the heat, the Brightside Crossing remained undiscovered and uninhabitable for hundreds of years. \nMajor Tom Mikuta decided to follow in the footsteps of Wyatt and Carpenter and take on the challenge. The promise of power and discovery draws the main characters forward, as well as the idea of being the first. Mikuta claims that if he were to make the crossing, Mercury would be his. The challenge of the Brightside Crossing is the origin of their desire.",
        "Summary_2": "It is significant to the explorers because it has never been done before, so being the first would presumably make them very famous. On a greater scale, a successful crossing means conquering Mercury for humanity to the Major. He thinks that if he can successfully cross the bright side of Mercury at perihelion (when the planet is closest to the sun) then man has \u201cgot Mercury\u201d. As in, if they have the technologies, knowledge, and skills to make the crossing at the hottest possible time there is nothing that isn\u2019t possible for humans to do on the planet.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Brightside Crossing is significant because no one has done it successfully, though it has been attempted before. It is also significant because the entire story is about the Brightside Crossing. Baron\u2019s well-publicized upcoming mission to cross it is what brings Claney to speak with him (and try to talk him out of it), and the story Claney tells is about his own experience attempting to cross, as he is the only man on Earth to have survived an attempt (though he did sustain some physical damage). The Brightside gets its name from one of the most dangerous things about it: its proximity to the sun. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Many climbers and explorers wish to take on the Brightside Crossing, but it seems as though the trip is nearly impossible. Wyatt and Carpenter, two famous explorers, attempted to make the trip across the hottest planetary surface in the solar system in 2082, and they never returned from the trip. \n\nPeter Claney is the only living man who has attempted the trip and made it back alive. He was not successful in his mission to cross the perihelion, so it can be assumed that he turned back towards The Twilight Lab after his teammates perished. \n\nMaps of the terrain are shoddy at best since, and the surface is ever changing. Volcanoes erupt, cracks appear, cliffs crumble, and photography and technology is not yet good enough to create detailed pictures of the surface that would allow explorers to create a definitive and safe route. Since the men must travel at least 70 miles a day, there can be zero detours. It\u2019s a constant game of scanning the terrain and making last minute decisions about which way is safest. \n\nPeter Claney and his teammates are motivated almost entirely by their desire to be the first people to conquer The Brightside Crossing. They believe that The Brightside would get them or they would get The Brightside. There is no other way, and their fame and success makes the dangerous trip worth a try. \n"

There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep>We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast\nwith thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\ncould cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\nCenter exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury\u2019s closest\napproach to the Sun\u2014which made Center the hottest part of\nthe planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n  \n \n  The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\nwhen we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\nthat Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\nsurface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\nwas only half done\u2014we would still have to travel another\ntwo thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\nwas to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory\u2019s scout ship,\napproximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n  \n \n  That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\nseventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\nwhat terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\ntime-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\nthat.\n  \n \n  The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\ndown for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\nyou a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you\u2019ll have the job of\ndragging the sledges, so we\u2019ll have to direct your course pretty\nclosely. Peter\u2019s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\nIf there\u2019s any doubt of safe passage, we\u2019ll all explore ahead\non foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: \u201cJack\nand I were planning to change around. We figured he could\ntake the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major looked up sharply at Stone. \u201cDo you buy that,\nJack?\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. Mac wanted\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I just feel better when I\u2019m on the move. Does\nit make any difference?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t,\u201d said the Major. \u201cThen you\u2019ll flank\nPeter along with me. Right?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSure, sure.\u201d McIvers pulled at his lower lip. \u201cWho\u2019s going\nto do the advance scouting?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt sounds like I am,\u201d I cut in. \u201cWe want to keep the lead\nBug light as possible.\u201d\n  \n \n  Mikuta nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Peter\u2019s Bug is stripped down\nto the frame and wheels.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers shook his head. \u201cNo, I mean the\n   \n   advance\n   \n  work.\nYou need somebody out ahead\u2014four or five miles, at least\u2014to\npick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe stared at the Major. \u201cI mean, how can we tell what sort of\na hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up\nahead?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s what we have the charts for,\u201d the Major said\nsharply.\n  \n \n  \u201cCharts! I\u2019m talking about\n   \n   detail\n   \n  work. We don\u2019t need to\nworry about the major topography. It\u2019s the little faults you\ncan\u2019t see on the pictures that can kill us.\u201d He tossed the charts\ndown excitedly. \u201cLook, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\nreconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\nI can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\narea closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\nThen\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo dice,\u201d the Major broke in.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut why not? We could save ourselves days!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t care what we could save. We stay together. When\nwe get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\nmeans we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\nclimber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\nalone\u2014any time, any place.\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\ngave a sullen nod. \u201cOkay. If you say so.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, I say so and I mean it. I don\u2019t want any fancy stuff.\nWe\u2019re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\nGot that?\u201d\n  \n \n  McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\nwe nodded, too.\n  \n \n  \u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got it straight,\nlet\u2019s go.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I\u2019ll\nnever forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\nbreak, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\nfirst few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\nfresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\nthe Twilight Lab.\n  \n \n  I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\nMajor and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\ntaking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\nStone dragged the sledges.\n  \n \n  Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\nthe big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\nash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\nthe first twenty miles.\n  \n \n  I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\nthe track the early research teams had made out into the edge\nof Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson\u2019s\nlittle outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\nwere in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\nbite.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the heat so much those first days out. We\n   \n   saw\n   \n  it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\ndegrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\nthat glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\nsome nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\nsweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n  \n \n  We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\ncame due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\na light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\nThe sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\ndegrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\nforward sledge\u2014sucking through tubes\u2014protein, carbohydrates,\nbulk gelatin, vitamins.\n  \n \n  The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\nwe\u2019d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\nWe were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\nand psychiatrists why\u2014they can give you have a dozen interesting\nreasons\u2014but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\nhappened to be so.\n  \n \n  We didn\u2019t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\neyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\nbut we couldn\u2019t sleep them off. We sat around looking\nat each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\ntaste, and off we\u2019d go. We\u2019d have murdered our grandmothers\nfor one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n  \n \n  After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\nthe wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\nEarth\u2019s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.\nHuge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\nwith black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\nwith a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\ngases.\n  \n \n  It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\nthe challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\nhad ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\ntried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\nso it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\nthe hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\ncould throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\n  \n \n  Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\nbefore, except for that Sun. We\u2019d fought absolute cold before\nand won. We\u2019d never fought heat like this and won. The only\nworse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\nitself.\n  \n \n  Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\nget us. That was the bargain.\n  \n \n  I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\nThe gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\nonto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\neast. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\non Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\ncones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\nsides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n  \n \n  We couldn\u2019t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,\nsulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\nface of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\nrose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\nrubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\nfrom the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\ndust\u2014silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\nash, filling crevices and declivities\u2014offering a soft, treacherous\nsurface for the Bug\u2019s pillow tires.\n  \n \n  I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\nsag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\nfrom an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\na halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\nlight copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more\nuntil we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\nwas cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\nat first.\n  \n \n  Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\nthink so, too.\n  \n \n  McIvers\u2019 restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\nHe talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\ndriving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\nwith repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\nnow and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n  \n \n  Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\neach stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn\u2019t like it, but\nI figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\nenough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n  \n \n  And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\nthe sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\nfilters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\nconstantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\nend of an eight-hour trek.\n  \n \n  But it took one of those side trips of McIvers\u2019 to deliver the\npenultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\ndown a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\nroute and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\nheard a sharp cry through our earphones.\n  \n \n  I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and\nspotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\ntop of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\nthe gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\nhorrible pictures racing through our minds....\n  \n \n  We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\nand, for once, he didn\u2019t have anything to say. It was the wreck\nof a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that\nhadn\u2019t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in\nthe rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the\nmiddle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were\ntwo insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the\nfiberglass helmets.\n  \n \n  This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on\n   \n   their\n   \n  Brightside Crossing.\n  \n<doc-sep>I\u2019d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\nI can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when\nWyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt\u2014that was in 2082,\nI think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\nI was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n  \n \n  I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\nproper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\nconditions, without any charts\u2014they couldn\u2019t have made\na hundred miles\u2014but I didn\u2019t know that then and it was a\nterrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n  \n \n  But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n  \n \n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  \n \n  I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  \n \n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n  \n \n  He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n  \n \n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, I mean\n   \n   real\n   \n  heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be\ndangerous, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\n  \n \n  I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\n  \n \n  He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?\nWhat have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\n   \n   nobody\u2019s\n   \n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n  \n \n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n   \n   how\n   \n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n  \n \n  I wanted to be along.\n  \n",

Possibly fed up by McIvers\u2019 constant joking or tortured by the fear that he would be lost on this planet forever, Stone became a shell of himself. \nIn the end, after McIvers discovered the corpses of the two discoverers that came before them, Wyatt and Carpenter, we can only assume that Stone\u2019s fear and reservedness increased tremendously.

He arrives to Twilight Lab a few days before Claney and Mikuta to be briefed by Sanderson, and brings the supplies and equipment for the mission with him. By the time the other two arrive, Jack seems somewhat despondent based on what Sanderson has told him about the difficulties and improbability of the mission. Jack is assigned to flank Peter on the mission, along with Mikuta, but agrees to switch positions with McIvers and pull the sledges instead. This seems like something McIvers had pushed for in a previous conversation, but Jack says he doesn\u2019t mind and Mikuta agrees to the switch.

        "Summary_1": "The mining for a precious ore called Acoustix has spurred colonization of Jupiter\u2019s eighth moon by two mining companies called Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. There is a barren desert landscape between the mining areas of the two companies that is called the Baldric. The only plant appears to be trees that have melon-shaped tops, and the only animal is a silver parrot-like bird that is capable of imitating human speech, and also of imitating human forms in a holographic-like manner.\n\nGrannie Annie (AKA Annabella C. Flowers) is a famous science fiction writer, who is travelling to the Baldric with her martian employee, Xartal, who takes detailed drawings that are the background research for her next novel. She is travelling in a party of four: herself, Xartal, Ezra Karn (old prospector), and the narrator (called Billy-boy by Grannie).\n\nStrange happenings are known to occur in the Baldric. They encounter a silver bird that repeats English words and creates what seems like a mirage of themselves projected in the distance which disappears as it comes closer. They do not know at the time, but the parrot has created this mirage based on viewing one of the lifelike drawings that Xartal is making of the group.\n\nThey happen to run into Jimmy Baker, the manager of the Larynx Incorporated mining company, who is interested in Grannie\u2019s help sorting out the root cause of his workers coming down with \u201cred spot fever\u201d which causes them to leave their work and walk into the Baldric, never to return. They travel to Larynx Incorporated\u2019s offices with Jimmy, where he learns all of the workers from Shaft Four have left their posts due to the fever. Coincidentally, that is also their most productive ore location. Jimmy, Grannie, and Xartal take off to Shaft Four via the Baldric to investigate what is going on. During their travel, they break for camp near a flock of the birds and discover their ability to imitate human forms.\n\nAntlers Karn, the manager of Interstellar Voice, turns out to be a bad guy who ambushes Grannie\u2019s camp. He is trying to sabotage Jimmy\u2019s company by causing the red spot fever to stop them from capitalizing on a huge deposit of Acoustix they discovered in Shaft Four.

        "Summary_2": "The story starts three days into an expedition on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, led by Annabella C. Flowers, a science fiction author, known by her friends as Grannie Annie. Also in the group were some of her friends: the narrator Billy, the prospector Ezra Karn, and the Martian illustrator named Xartal. The moon was known for Acoustix, an ore that allows aging Martians to improve their supersonic telecommunication abilities. They traveled through the desert to an area called the Baldric, which was filled with cat-tail-like trees and silver cockatoo-like creatures. Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice (an Acoustix mining company) had told them about the area. As they continued on, the group had a shock: they saw duplicates of themselves traveling toward them. It was not a simple mirage, as they could hear the others talking. Once they got close, however, the doubles disappeared. Shaking off the odd situation, the group continued, and eventually ran into Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, the competitors of Interstellar Voice. It seemed Jimmy needed Grannie's help: his workers at the mine had been falling sick with Red Spot Fever, which made them wander into the Baldric. The group headed to the Larynx Incorporated offices, where Jimmy admitted that calling off the mining expedition would mean the end of Jimmy's company, so he needed to combat the Fever. Grannie grabbed supplies from Jimmy's laboratory and they headed to the desert with Xartal. Ezra and Billy stayed to look around the offices, and briefly talked to Antlers Park on the visiphone. He had less issue with the Fever, but had an antitoxin that he was willing to share with Jimmy. Through a camera on Jimmy's car, Billy was able to watch the group in the desert as another set of mirages appeared. Grannie excitedly realized that the cockatoos on the moon were copying Xartal's drawings, mimicking the mental images and causing these \"mirages\". Ezra and Billy headed to Jimmy's office to investigate reports, realizing that everyone fell sick in the barracks, not while mining. They found a lens in the barracks that was pushing concentrated rays towards the workers, so they ran to the visiscreen room to find out where Grannie was. They were surprised to see Antlers Park was the only person in the car with Grannie, Jimmy and Xartal nowhere to be seen. Ezra and Billy drove out to meet them, where Billy realized this was a cockatoo and not the actual Grannie. Antlers Park eventually gave up the information about where he had left Grannie and the others, and when Billy and Ezra found them, Grannie showed them the blue ultraviolet light that had been set up to counteract the red rays that cause the fever. It seemed that the lens amplifying the rays to cause the fever was placed in Jimmy's company's barracks by Antlers' company, and the Red Spot Fever was a plan to keep Jimmy's company from becoming more successful than Antlers'.

        "Summary_3": "Annabella C. Flowers, known as Grannie Annie, is a famed science fiction writer who summons the story's narrator, Billy, to join her on a mission to the 8th moon of Jupiter, where she ostensibly plans to observe the setting for her next novel. She also invites her constant companion, a prospector name Ezra Karn, and her illustrator, a Martian named Xartal. On the moon, the team unites at the offices of Interstellar Voice, a company managed by Antlers Park. Upon Billy's arrival, Antlers updates him on the history of the company; Interstellar Voice and their rival company Larynx Incorporated mine the moon for its resource of an ore called Acoustix, which is popular amongst Martians because of its ability to revitalize their supersonic vocalizations that dwindle around middle age. Between the properties of these two companies stretches a vast desert known as the Baldric, which is home to a bird-like species resembling cockatoos as well as flagpole trees. Grannie Annie plans to cross in order to further observe the moon's environment and make way to Larynx Incorporated. Antlers Park warns them vaguely of danger in the Baldric, but the team leaves anyway. During the course of their journey, they observe the cockatoos and discover their ability to mimic human voices. In addition, they discover an alarming visage--from their perch atop a high cliff, they see four travelers, seemingly themselves in exact 3D duplicate, walking along the same path they'd just traversed. After this odd discovery, they meet Jimmy Baker, who arrives in his car guided through the air attached to a kite, and Grannie Annie reveals the true purpose of their trip is to help Jimmy resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. His workers have been stricken with Red-Spot Fever, which causes them to abandon their job and walk into the desert; Jimmy worries this will destroy his business. After Grannie Annie, Xartal, and Jimmy Baker leave to tour his company's laboratory and Shaft Four, Billy and Ezra stay behind and tour the offices of Larynx Incorporated. An employee shows them an updated visiphone from which they can view Grannie Annie's journey, and they witness them stopping by a cockatoo nest, where a cockatoo observes Xartal's drawings and uses its ability to mentally mimic images to recreate his drawings of the team in 3D just as they saw previously in the desert. When Billy and Ezra discover a device in the workers' bunker that has been used to spread Red-Spot Fever and see Grannie Annie is returning with Antlers Park, they rush to meet them. Billy realizes this isn\u2019t the real Grannie Annie, but rather her 3D image, and they hurry to stop Antlers Park. After a chase, Antlers admits he set up the Red-Spot device in order to sabotage his business rival.

        "Summary_4": "Grannie Annie, Ezra Karn, and Billy-Boy are on Jupiter\u2019s Eighth Moon. Xartal, a Martian, is also there to draw illustrations for Grannie Annie\u2019s book. The group meets with Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice, and he tells them about the Baldric, a stretch of land that connects his company, Interstellar Voice, with Larynx Incorporated. The two companies are competing to harvest Acoustix. Acoustix is an ore that amplifies Martians\u2019 thoughts so that they can continue to speak to Earthmen even in their old age when their ability to produce vibrations diminishes. Park warns that the Baldric is dangerous, but Annie is undeterred. \n\nAnnie, Ezra, Billy, and Xartal arrive at the Baldric and spot a cockatoo. Xartal draws the creature and the group members in his notebook. Moments later, Annie spots four figures that look just like herself and her crew members walking on the other side of the hill. The apparent mirage disappears quickly.\n\nBilly sees a kite car, and minutes later Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, approaches the group. His company is in trouble because a lot of its workers have come down with Red Spot Fever. The workers become talkative and then they walk out into the Baldric. Annie, Jimmy, and Xartal head out to investigate. Billy and Ezra stay behind, and they check out an invention of Jimmy\u2019s - a three-dimensional screen that makes them feel like they\u2019re right there with their group members. They speak to Park on the contraption, and he says that he will give Jimmy the antidote to Red Spot Fever. Billy spots his own likeness on the screen, and he\u2019s shocked. Annie tells the others that the cockatoos are looking at Xartal\u2019s drawings and projecting their mental images of his pictures. \n\nBilly realizes that all of the workers become sick when they\u2019re in their barracks, not when they\u2019re in the mines. At the barracks, Ezra finds a piece of metal with a lens on the wall. The infra-red rays from Jupiter are causing the plague; the lens was put there to amplify those rays, and they sicken the sleeping workers. \n\nBilly and Ezra return to the screen and see Park driving a kite car with Annie by his side.  While the men follow Park\u2019s car, he tries to shoot at them. He fails, and Ezra uses a tool to grab Park by the throat. Billy and Ezra find Annie and hundreds of Jimmy\u2019s workers. The group has set up a large ultraviolet light that works to fight the infra-red rays that cause the fever. It was Park all along who was forcing the men to become sick because he did not want Jimmy\u2019s company to be competitive. Park had tried to get Grannie Annie sick as well, but he ended up taking her duplicate image in the kite car instead of the real one. \n"

The big ship had landed, and little blue\nsparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic\nclamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and\nfive men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood\nsurveying the three who faced them.\n  \n \n  The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their\ndarkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.\n  \n \n  \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you\nthink of this situation Billy?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his\nheels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have\nto take steps.\"\n  \n \n  The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling\nlaughter.\n  \n \n  Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an\nethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled\u2014and his smile remained fixed,\ndangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came\nabreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave\nback a step, as he saw their intentions.\n  \n \n  \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll\nreport you to the Interplanetary Commission!\"\n  \n \n  It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of\nthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of\nthe girl's spasticizer\u2014a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained\nchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at\nQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He\nhurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid\nand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.\n  \n \n  At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his\nhand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked\nthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something\ncrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar\nplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,\nand his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,\nbefore the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete\ndarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage\u2014then a scream of pain.\n  \n \n  What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,\nhe didn't care. Then\u2014lights out.\n  \n<doc-sep>Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n  \n \n  He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n  \n \n  He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n  \n \n  The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n  \n \n  \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n  \n \n  \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n  \n \n  The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n  \n \n  The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n  \n \n  Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n  \n \n  Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty.\n  \n",

When Antlers Park said that the area would be trouble, Grannie knew she had to investigate. The Baldric itself acts as a line between the areas controlled by the two mining companies, and the mines themselves are where the work happens. Most of the surface, then, is covered either in sand or rock. The other major location in the story is the headquarters of Larynx Incorporated, which is also on Jupiter's Eighth Moon. In the headquarters, there are barracks for the miners, which have huge windows made of denvo-quartz. There is a commissary where people can eat, and a number of administrative areas such as Jimmy's office, and a large visiscreen room where the characters at the headquarters are able to track the movements of the part of the group that left to investigate Red Spot Fever.

        "Summary_3": "The primary action of the story takes place on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, where Grannie Annie assembles a team to help Jimmy Baker resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. Although the team assembles at the headquarters of Jimmy's rival company, Interstellar Voice, they never go inside, and immediately make their way across a vast, desert-like area known as the Baldric. The manager of Interstellar Voice, Antlers Park, warns them of threats in the Baldric, but they never run into any such danger. Instead, they observe two of the Baldric's most unique characteristics: The flagpole trees that look like vertical cat tails topped with a melon-like protuberance and the bird-like creatures resembling cockatoos that build large, transparent, web-like nests between them. The cockatoos are silver and look like parrots with a crest and have the unique ability to mimic not only the sounds of a person's voice but also the 3D image of their visage in exact duplicate. As the team makes their way across the desert, they are pelted by wind and powdery sand and climb a high ridge from which they are picked up by Jimmy Baker flying his kite-guided car. These vehicles appear to be the main mode of transportation for representatives of both companies on the moon. The final unique setting of the story is Larynx Incorporated, which is comprised of offices and crew bunkers in a large central building, several mining shafts spread throughout the Baldric, a laboratory, a commissary, and an experimental shop. From one of the many offices in the building, an operator shows Billy and Ezra an update to the visiphone that allows viewers to witness 3D events remotely.

They stand straight up and have a bulbous fruit or vegetable that grows out of the very top. The entire surface is covered in sand, and wind is an ever-present feature of the atmosphere. There are also hundreds of birds that look a lot like cockatoos. The birds look at Xartal\u2019s drawings and then project those images out of their minds. This makes it appear like there are two Grannie Annies or two Billys, when there is really just one. The cockatoos\u2019 ability to project images is similar to their ability to repeat words and phrases that humans say. \n \nThe characters also venture inside of Larynx Incorporated, the company owned by Jimmy Baker.

        "Article": "Moments later a rude circle of flagpole trees loomed ahead. Across the\ntop of them was stretched a translucent web. Jimmy and Grannie got out\nof the car and began making camp. Xartal remained in his seat. He was\ndrawing pictures on large pieces of pasteboard, and as I stood there in\nthe visiscreen room, I watched him.\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it, the Martian was clever. He would make\na few rapid lines on one of the pasteboards, rub it a little to get\nthe proper shading and then go on to the next. In swift rotation\nlikenesses of Ezra Karn, of myself, of Jimmy Baker, and of Antlers Park\ntook form.\n  \n \n  Ezra spoke over my shoulder. \"He's doing scenes for Grannie's new\nbook,\" he said. \"The old lady figures on using the events here for a\nplot.\n   \n   Look at that damned nosy bird!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  A silver cockatoo had alighted on the kite car and was surveying\ncuriously Xartal's work.

Abruptly it flew to the top of the\neyrie, where it seemed to be having a consultation with its bird\ncompanions.\n  \n \n  And then abruptly it happened. The cockatoos took off in mass flight. A\ngroup of Earth people suddenly materialized on the eyrie, talking and\nmoving about as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n  \n \n  With a shock I saw the likeness of myself; I saw Ezra Karn; and I saw\nthe image of Jimmy Baker.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   real\n   \n  Jimmy Baker stood next to Grannie, staring up at this\nincredible mirage. Grannie let out a whoop. \"I've got it!\" she said.\n\"Those things we see up there are nothing more than mental images.\nThey're Xartal's drawings!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as we\nheaded back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on an\nelectric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently these\nadjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for the\ncar's ability to move in any direction.\n  \n \n  \"If I weren't a realist, I'd say that\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  has been\nbewitched,\" he began slowly. \"We pay our men high wages and give them\nexcellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.\nUp until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health and\nspirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Red Spot Fever?\" Grannie looked at him curiously.\n  \n \n  Jimmy Baker nodded. \"The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousness\non the part of the patient. Then they disappear.\"\n  \n \n  He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.\n  \n \n  \"They walk out into the Baldric,\" he continued, \"and nothing can stop\nthem. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon as\nthey realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyes\nare turned, they give us the slip.\"\n  \n \n  \"But surely you must have some idea of where they go,\" Grannie said.\n  \n \n  Baker lit a cigarette. \"There's all kinds of rumors,\" he replied, \"but\nnone of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrie\nahead of us.\"\n  \n \n  I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended between\na rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation of\ntranslucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos were\nperched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, but\nthey didn't move.\n  \n \n  After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,\na door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face was\ndrawn.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Baker,\" he said breathlessly, \"seventy-five workers at Shaft Four\nhave headed out into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.\n  \n \n  \"Shaft Four, eh?\" he repeated. \"That's our principal mine. If the fever\nspreads there, I'm licked.\"\n  \n \n  He motioned us into his office and strode across to a desk. Silent\nXartal, the Martian illustrator, took a chair in a corner and got his\nnotebook out, sketching the room's interior. Grannie Annie remained\nstanding.\n  \n \n  Presently the old lady walked across to the desk and helped herself to\nthe bottle of Martian whiskey there.\n  \n \n  \"There must be ways of stopping this,\" she said. \"Have you called in\nany physicians? Why don't you call an enforced vacation and send the\nmen away until the plague has died down?\"\n  \n \n  Baker shook his head. \"Three doctors from Callisto were here last\nmonth. They were as much at loss as I am. As for sending the men away,\nI may have to do that, but when I do, it means quits. Our company is\nchartered with Spacolonial, and you know what that means. Failure\nto produce during a period of thirty days or more, and you lose all\nrights.\"\n  \n \n  A visiphone bell sounded, and Baker walked across to the instrument. A\nman's face formed in the vision plate. Baker listened, said \"Okay\" and\nthrew off the switch.\n  \n \n  \"The entire crew of Shaft Four have gone out into the Baldric,\" he said\nslowly. There was a large map hanging on the wall back of Baker's desk.\nGrannie Annie walked across to it and began to study its markings.\n  \n \n  \"Shaft Four is at the outer edge of the Baldric at a point where that\ncorridor is at its widest,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Baker looked up. \"That's right. We only began operations there a\ncomparatively short time ago. Struck a rich vein of Acoustix that\nruns deep in. If that vein holds out, we'll double the output of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  , our rival, in a year.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"I think you and I and Xartal had better take a run up\nthere,\" she said. \"But first I want to see your laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  There was no refusing her. Jimmy Baker led the way down to a lower\nlevel where a huge laboratory and experimental shop ran the length\nof the building. Grannie seized a light weight carry-case and began\ndropping articles into it. A pontocated glass lens, three or four\nWellington radite bulbs, each with a spectroscopic filament, a small\ndynamo that would operate on a kite windlass, and a quantity of wire\nand other items.\n  \n \n  The kite car was brought out again, and the old woman, Baker and the\nMartian took their places in it. Then Jimmy waved, and the car began to\nroll down the ramp.\n  \n<doc-sep>I listened to all this in silence. \"But,\" I said when she had finished,\n\"how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine\nlaborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie frowned. \"I'm not sure I can answer the first of those\nquestions,\" she replied. \"You must remember Antlers Park has been on\nthis moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted\nhimself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n  \n \n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens\nbuttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master\ncontrolling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners\nwere in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would\nbe susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you\ncoming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Coming with you?\" I repeated. \"Where?\"\n  \n \n  The old lady lit a cigarette. \"Pluto maybe,\" she said. \"There's a penal\ncolony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new\ncrime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,\nfugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....\"\n  \n \n  \"Grannie,\" I laughed. \"You're incorrigible!\"\n  \n \n",

Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another.

This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli.

There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune.

I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "It is a precious, lightweight ore found on at least one of Jupiter\u2019s moons (eighth moon) that is highly valuable on Mars, but of no value on Earth. Martians are able to speak out loud as Earthlings do by supersonically amplifying their thoughts. As Martians grow beyond middle age, they are no longer able to do this amplification without the assistance of the Acoustix ore. Thus, it is highly valuable to them.\n\nThe ore is the only reason for colonization of Jupiter\u2019s moons, and there are two main companies that mine it - Interstellar Voice, Larynx Incorporated. It becomes a source of greed, which causes the manager of Interstellar Voice (Antlers Karn) to attempt sabotage against the other company, serving as the main climax of the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Acoustix is an ore found on Jupiter's eighth moon that helps older martians continue to amplify their thoughts with their supersonic communication methods that usually deteriorate once the Martian hits middle age. Although there is no use for it on Earth, it is the entire reason there is colonial presence on the moon, and the reason for the presence of the companies Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. The ore is therefore the primary point of competition between the two companies, and when Larynx Incorporated finds a new, rich source of the ore, Antlers Park decides he has to take action to keep Jimmy Baker's company from getting ahead. This is why Antlers made a small device to make the rays more concentrated, to shine them on the workers in the barracks, to give them Red Spot Fever. This would allow him to take over the area that is rich in ore.  \n",
        "Summary_3": "Acoustix is an ore unique to Jupiter's Eighth Moon and is the reason for the presence of the mining operations of Intersteller Voice and Larynx Incorporated. As Antlers Park informs Billy, although the ore is useless to Earthmen, the Martians highly value it. Because Martians speak using a supersonic method, they are able to amplify their thoughts via high-frequency wavelengths. As they get older, this ability decreases, and the Acoustix has the ability to restore that ability to its previous strength. Jimmy Baker's company, Larynx Incorporated, has discovered a massive reserve of Acoustix that would essentially put them far ahead of their competition, and therefore Antlers Park works to sabotage them by spreading Red-Spot fever amongst his workers, knowing their discovery would hurt his own business, Interstellar Voice. Jimmy worries that the labor shortage will impair his company's ability to mine Shaft Four, which produces their largest share of Acoustix, and will lead to the termination of his charter through Spacolonial.",
        "Summary_4": "Acoustix is the ore that Larynx Incorporated and Interstellar Voice are both harvesting and selling. As far as anyone knows, Acoustix can only be found on this moon of Jupiter's. The ore is useless on Earth, but Martians use it to continue to communicate with Earthmen after they have reached old age. Martians create wave lengths with their thoughts using vibrations. After they become older, they are unable to create the same frequency of vibrations, and therefore lose the ability to speak with others. The Acoustix ore revitalizes the organ they use to create the vibrations, and it gives them the gift of communication once more. \n\nAntlers Park does not want Jimmy Baker and his company to outdo his business, Interstellar Voice. The men share access to the Baldric, which is where the miners are harvesting Acoustix. If Park can get Baker out of the way, he will have the whole stretch of land to harvest for himself, and he will be the sole person profiting off of the moon. He hatches a plan to make Baker's employees sick with Red Spot Fever so that they walk off the job and leave the Acoustix to his miners to gather and sell. \n\n"

        "Summary_1": "The symptoms of the fever are described as \u201cgarrulousness\u201d followed by the victims leaving their post and walking into the Baldric desert.\n\nThe fever is brought on by infra-red rays from Jupiter\u2019s great spot. Normally, people on this moon aren\u2019t coming down with the fever from their regular activities. However, a lens-like device mounted in the window of the worker barracks at Larynx Incorporated projects the infra-red rays from the great spot around the room onto the sleeping workers which puts them into this trance-like state.\n\nAntlers Karn is responsible for causing the Red Spot Fever by having the devices installed in his competitors' barracks. He also claims to have developed an antitoxin that would reverse the fever, however, it is implied that this was only a lie to cover up his actions.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Red Spot Fever makes the people who catch it start to talk a lot, and after rambling for a while the people wander into the Baldric as long as they can do so unnoticed. When someone is watching them to try to see where they are going, they stop until they can slip away. This is a big issue for the mining companies that rely on their workers for survival. The Fever comes about by the infra-red rays from Jupiter's great spot, and exposure to these rays over time causes the Fever in humans. The good news is that the infra-red rays can be combated with ultra violet light, which we see Jimmy Baker and Xartal use at the end of the story, shining the light on the miners to counteract the exposure.  ",
        "Summary_3": "Jimmy Baker believes he is losing his workers to onset Red Spot Fever, the symptoms of which include extreme talkativeness followed by a tendency to wander away and disappear. Following the discovery of the massive store of Acoustix around Shaft Four, his workers began wandering into the vastness of the Baldric. Billy and Ezra confirm Jimmy's suspicions when they discover a device hidden in the barracks at Larynx Incorporated that concentrates and amplifies the power of the infra-red rays from nearby Jupiter's great spot. The device operates on a timer so that it beams onto the workers as they sleep. Antlers Park admits to having installed the device because he feared the resultant competition from Jimmy Baker's discovery of the deep Acoustix vein. In order to combat the Red Spot Fever, Annie and Jimmy concoct a plan to utilize Jimmy's kite car as a makeshift beam from which to cast ultraviolet rays upon the wandering workers. Since the rays are at the opposite end of the vibratory scale, they can be used to subvert the symptoms of Red Spot Fever and draw the workers back to Larynx Incorporated.",
        "Summary_4": "Red Spot Fever is an illness that Jimmy Baker's workers come down with after Antlers Park hatches a plan to make them sick. He or one of his minions sneaks into the workers' barracks and places a piece of metal with a lens on the wall. The lens works to amplify Jupiter's infrared-rays, and the rays hit the men while they are sleeping. The workers are affected by this contraption because it makes them extremely talkative and forces them to walk out of their mines. Importantly, Billy looks through Jimmy Baker's folder of victims and makes a connection that the men are becoming sick while they are sleeping, and not while they are working. This gives Ezra and Billy the idea to go to the barracks and look around, and that's when they find the lens that amplifies the harmful rays. \n\nGrannie Annie is able to solve the problem by hitting the infected men with ultraviolet light which counteracts against the infrared-rays. When the men are no longer poisoned by the infrared, they walk right back to their work stations. "

Purnie is careful not to disturb the animals he sees along the way because he has frozen time, and everything must resume normally when he unfreezes it. He knows that time-stopping is forbidden for animals his age, but he chooses to believe that his family will be proud of his bravery. \n\nFinally, he sees the ocean in front of him, and he resumes time. He does a head-stand and feels weak and dizzy. These feelings are a result of the time-stop, and he knows it. Purnie approaches some humans on the beach. A man named Forbes is in the middle of explaining to his captain, Benson, that he has found 17 planets to claim as his own. Forbes is hellbent on raising his FORBES flag as soon as possible. He is eager to stake his claim to the land and says that his mission is much bigger than real estate alone. Benson retorts that yes, his mission is bigger than just real estate because his paperwork says that Forbes will own all of the inhabitants of the planets he claims as well as the land. \n\nThe crew members use a special machine and  find radiation emanating from Purnie. Forbes demands that they put the animal in a box. Benson protests and reminds Forbes that it\u2019s against Universal Law, but Forbes insists. Purnie experiences his first-ever impulse to run away with fear when a noose comes towards him. He goes back to pick up his fruit, and Forbes shoots him in the leg. When the man throws the noose again, Purnie involuntarily stops time. He drags himself up the knoll where he originally came from. \n\nThe humans are astonished when time resumes and Purnie is not where he was a split second ago. They spot him up on top of a pile of petrified logs, and suddenly the logs fall down the hill and pin the men down. Purnie is shocked and regretful. The whole thing was an accident. He deliberately stops time and uses all of his remaining strength to lift the logs off of the humans. Purnie begins to lose consciousness, and he knows that he must resume time or he will die. After pouring all of his strength into this action, time does begin again. The humans resume life and feel as though they have gone mad. They know that they were just facing death by drowning, and now they are free. The logs were so heavy that it would have taken superhuman strength to move them. Forbes, in particular, has really gone mad, and he laughs to himself uncontrollably. Benson believes that Purnie was responsible for moving the logs, but of course that seems physically impossible. \n \nPurnie stares off at the beautiful ocean views and watches the men leave in their vehicle as he dies. \n",
        "Summary_2": "On his fifth birthday, Purnie--a small, kangaroo-like creature with large eyes--runs through the forest as he goes to see the beach for the first time. Bemoaning the fact that days are so short, he triggers his ability to stop time. He marvels at the bees frozen in mid-air and reminds himself to not abuse his time-stopping power or it could drain all of his energy and kill him. Before arriving at the beach, he gathers some fruit for lunch and then pauses atop a small, rocky hill from where he takes in his first view of the ocean. Purnie is overwhelmed and thrilled at the idea of making friends with the new animals he sees: three-legged tripons, a flock of spora, and, further down, a group of ten humans making their way onto the beach. When he unfreezes time, Purnie climbs down the rockpile and runs around the beach, showing his new animal friends his headstand technique. Next, he visits two humans, who barely notice his presence. Captain Benson is the hired leader of the expedition; Forbes is a wealthy real estate investor who owns seventeen planets and considers himself a \"pioneer\". Forbes explains to Benson that coming to the planet is a mere formality as he has already staked his claim to make this planet his eighteenth; planting a flag emblazoned with his name is a symbolic gesture. Benson's men wish to explore the new planet and its native species, but Forbes is impatient to build his flagpole and leave. He has no interest in learning about the creatures there, only in owning their land and tripling his investment over time. Purnie wants to play with the humans, and Forbes expresses his annoyance and tries to get a crewmember to take him away. One of the crew members, Miles, checks the planet's surface for radiation while Benson and Forbes investigate the rockpile where Purnie had perched earlier to see if the rocks may be used to support Forbes' flagpole. After they determine the rocks are extremely heavy petrified logs and cannot be moved, Miles alerts them that Purnie is emitting a large amount of radiation. Forbes orders the crew to capture Purnie so he can take him home, reproduce him, and profit off of his radiation resource. As Purnie evades capture, thinking he is playing with the men, Forbes grows impatient and shoots him, causing Purnie to instinctively stop time. Injured, Purnie takes shelter atop the petrified logs, which fall under him and crush the humans below. Panicked, Purnie rushes to remove the logs, using up his own energy. When he unfreezes time again, the men are astonished. In one moment, they were crushed by logs, and in the next, the logs had disappeared. This drives Forbes insane, and he laughs as they take him away to the ship. Having exhausted all of his energy saving the men, Purnie watches them leave, succumbs to his wounds, and dies.",
        "Summary_3": "Purnie, a five-year-old creature, is off from school for his birthday and takes a secret trip to see the ocean. When he is near enough to smell the ocean, Purnie freezes time even though he has been warned about the amount of energy this takes, and there is a maxim that small children who stop time without an adult may not live to regret it. When he reaches the shore, he recognizes the petrified logs, spora, and tripons from his brothers\u2019 descriptions and is delighted to find two-legged animals there as well. Purnie approaches the two-legged animals who are actually humans and speaks to them but is ignored. The humans discuss the men who are curiously looking at the animals around them, and Forbes, the leader, orders Captain Benson to have the men work right away. Purnie follows the men closely, and Forbes gets annoyed and kicks at him. They talk about this being Forbes's eighteenth planet, and Forbes wants his flag planted and a cornerstone and plaque installed. One of the men gets a strong reading on his scintillometer, a device that detects radiation. Tracing the reading, they find it is coming from Purnie. Forbes orders Purnie put into a lead box, thinking radioactive animals can reproduce and provide an endless supply of radioactive materials. Benson is reluctant because putting Purnie in the box will kill him, and it goes against Universal Law. Forbes reminds him of their contract, and Benson has his men try to rope Purnie, who thinks it is a game and playfully comes near the box before running away. When Forbes loses patience, he shoots at Purnie to wound him. Stunned, he stops and sees the noose coming toward him. Purnie freezes time again, limps away, and climbs to the top of the bluff. When he restarts time, the men are shocked he is no longer there on the beach with them. Spying Purnie on the bluff, they approach him; Purnie shifts, causing the logs to slide down and hit the men. Purnie is shocked and saddened at their suffering and feels awful he caused it. He realizes some of the men will drown because they can\u2019t move and the tide is coming in, so he freezes time again, pulls the logs off the men, and drags them onto the beach. At the top of the hill, he restarts time, and the men are puzzled to be back on the beach with the logs off them. They question their sanity, and Forbes really has gone insane. The men help those who are seriously wounded, disarm Forbes and tie his hands together, and return him to the ship. Benson wonders why Purnie would come back to the humans who tormented him and goes back to the beach looking for him. He calls out for Purnie, tells him they made a mistake, and he would like to help Purnie if he is hurt. When he doesn\u2019t see him, Benson leaves.",
        "Summary_4": "On an alien planet, a small non-human creature named Purnie is turning five years old. Purnie is precocious and adventurous, with the amazing ability to stop and start time with its mind. However, the super power comes with consequences. It tires Purnie to use time-stopping, and if done too much it can kill the user.\n\nPurnie leaves brothers and parents in a village in the forest and stops time while venturing beside a stream towards the ocean. Upon reaching a cliff overlooking the orange colored ocean, Purnie restarts time and discovers a group of human space explorers that are attempting to claim the planet and have only been onshore for 20 minutes musing at the strange creatures they are finding.\n\nForbes is from San Diego and has a history of claiming planets, this current one being the 17th if successfully staked with his flag, cornerstone, and plaque. He orders around Captain Benson and the rest of the crew, in a hurry to claim the planet upon their arrival.\n\nPurnie thinks the humans are friends to play with and tries to interact with them on multiple occasions. When the crew discovers that Purnie is radioactive, Forbes orders them to capture it and place it in a lead box to bring to Earth, which Forbes thinks will make him very rich. Purnie\u2019s confusion about their hostility leads to an involuntary stopping of time which is used to return to the top of the cliff. Accidentally, Purnie sets off a rock slide after restarting time from the location on the top of the cliff and sets off a rock slide while peering over the edge that traps most of the humans under rocks and petrified logs along the beach and in the ocean. Deep horror causes Pernie to once again stop time, go down to the beach, and move all the debris off the humans - saving their lives.\n\nWhen time restarts once again, the humans are completely baffled as to how they were rescued, and Forbes loses his grip on reality entirely - having to be tied up by the crew for their return trip. Captain Benson wonders why a creature they tried to capture and kill would have come back to their rescue from their almost certain deaths and goes looking for Pernie as the crew prepares to leave. Not finding Purnie, the spaceship takes off, and the final sight of Purnie\u2019s life before dying of exhaustion from using the superpower is a floating wet flag of Forbes' in the ocean.\n"

His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\nSlowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\ndistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\nthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\nfilled him with hysteria.\n  \n \n  The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\nOthers were pinned down on the sand.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He\nhopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\nshame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\nhis ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?\nPlease get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\ndone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\ntell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\nabout.\n  \n \n  The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\n  \n<doc-sep>The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in\ntheir heels.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's\nyour money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you\nhired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just\nwhat I've done.

Bunch of damn children.\"\n  \n \n  As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\nwill you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\njoy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\nhe got an upside down view of them walking away.\n  \n \n  He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\nWhat was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\nmore of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\ntrying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\nhis lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n  \n \n  Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\nwent down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\nvicinity.

The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his\nclaim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively\nnow!\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Forbes is the head of the expedition to claim planets, and Benson is the Captain of the crew. Forbes provides all of the money to make the trips possible, and he pays Benson\u2019s and the other mens\u2019 salaries. Captain Benson is responsible for keeping all of the men safe and making sure the trip goes smoothly. \n\nAlthough Forbes is Benson\u2019s superior, Benson does feel the need to speak his mind to Forbes. When Forbes demands that Benson\u2019s crew stop dawdling and hurry up and put his FORBES flag up, Benson tells Forbes that they are only humans. Of course they are interested in the new environment and want to take a moment to look around. He is not afraid to tell Forbes that capturing Purnie or injuring him is against Universal Laws. Benson does not want to take part in illegal activities, and he scoffs at Forbes\u2019 remarks that he is a pioneer and not a real estate developer. He openly tells Forbes that he knows he will triple his money after claiming these planets, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing it for the greater good of humanity. Benson also asks Forbes if he\u2019s going to take his 17 new planets back home with him to San Diego. It\u2019s clear that Benson has little respect for Forbes and the way he conducts his business, but at the same time, he needs a job and Forbes is providing him with an incredible opportunity to survey all sorts of different planets.\n\nBenson has to face Forbes\u2019 wrath when Purnie goes missing after Forbes shoots him and they attempt to put a noose around his neck. After Purnie unfreezes time, the men are confused as to what they just saw. Forbes turns to Benson and tells him that he is holding him responsible for this mishap even though there is zero evidence that Benson did anything wrong.\n\nAfter the logs fall on the men and Purnie uses all of his remaining strength to save their lives, Forbes is completely out of his mind. Benson finds it a bit humorous, especially since he has an inkling that Purnie, the bug-eyed creature, was behind the whole thing. He does not respect Forbes and thinks his disconnect to reality and repetitive laughter is what he deserves for the way he treated Purnie, himself, and the crew. \n",
        "Summary_2": "As a wealthy real estate investor who hires Captain Benson to lead the expedition to the new planet, Forbes treats Benson with a great amount of flippancy and disrespect. He disregards Benson's request to let the crew explore the planet before rushing to build his flagpole to symbolically stake his claim there. He completely ignores Benson when he shows concern for Purnie's well-being when Forbes wants to capture Purnie and take him home to profit off of the radiation in his body. While Benson cares for the safety of his crew and the lives of the new species they discover on this new planet, Forbes only sees ways in which he can personally profit and build his real estate empire. Forbes infuriates Benson when he shoots Purnie, and he goes so far as to call him a fool in spite of Forbes' warnings against talking to him with disrespect. While Benson attempts to understand how Purnie was able to evade capture, Forbes simply wants to maim Purnie and blame Benson for his own mistakes. When the crew gets pinned by the logs dislodged accidentally by Purnie, Benson's instincts are to find and help as many people as he can, including Forbes. ",
        "Summary_3": "For the most part, the two men seem to tolerate each other. Forbes has employed Benson to hire men to explore the eighteenth planet that Forbes intends to claim as his own. As the employer, Forbes uses his position to order Benson to carry out his demands, although sometimes Benson questions Forbes's orders and resists carrying them out. Benson also questions Forbes's right to claim all the planets he is claiming and pokes a little fun at him at times. When Forbes wants Benson to order his men right to work after they arrive, Benson counters by asking if Forbes is human since they\u2019ve only been there twenty minutes, and the men are curious about the new planet. Benson also needles Forbes when the men discover radiation, pointing out that he will make enough money to buy his next planet. Forbes is unimpressed with the discovery of radiation since they\u2019ve found some on each of his other planets so far, but not in significant quantities. Forbes is most concerned about staking his claim by installing his flag, a cornerstone, and a plaque. When Benson questions the importance of the flag, Forbes tells him it signifies an empire, development, and progress. When Benson says Forbes will practically own the people who buy real estate on Forbes's planets, Forbes angrily replies that it is he and other people like him who risk their own money to give Benson and others space ships and places to go so they can get away from their thirteen-story tenement houses. Once it becomes clear that Purnie is the source of the large amount of radiation their equipment is detecting, Forbes orders Benson to have the animal put in one of their lead boxes meant to hold radioactive minerals. When Benson starts to remind him that this is forbidden by Universal Law, Forbes asserts his authority, reminding Benson the planet is his, and he is the law. After Purnie avoids capture and Forbes wounds him, Benson calls Forbes a fool and tells him to put his gun away, but Forbes claims he just nicked the animal. When Purnie escapes their attempts to rope him, Forbes blames Benson for ruining everything and is determined to capture Purnie himself. Benson tries to stop him, but Purnie shifts on the pile of petrified logs, sending them onto the men. When Forbes goes mad at the end of the story, Benson orders his men to take his gun from him and tie his hands together as they take him to the ship. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Benson is the captain of Forbes\u2019 expedition spaceship that has landed on the ocean shore of an alien planet. Forbes is very much in charge and makes repeated orders to Benson throughout the story that he obeys. Benson attempts to keep the peace by following and acquiescing to Forbes\u2019 sometimes unethical orders (like placing the creature, Purnie, in a sealed lead box that would kill him). Benson has a sensitive reasoning that Forbes does not possess, like when he thinks it possible Purnie may just come along without being sealed in the box, and when he wonders why Purnie would return to rescue the men that had tried to capture him.\n"

There are forests with plentiful foliage, tall trees, and blue moss. The sky above has two moons and makes the trees seem endlessly tall with its low, dense, purple clouds. Throughout the forest flow milky-orange streams and whirlpools; bees buzz about pollinating paka plants.

When Purnie arrives at the ocean, he stands atop a large rock pile, which turns out to be comprised of heavy petrified logs. He has stopped time, so everything he sees is frozen mid-action: The orange-and-white waves of the ocean tower mid-break, and he sees a flock of spora flying overhead, three-legged tripons chewing on seaweed, and a group of humans.

The forest is colorful with patches of blue moss and a stream with milky-orange water with little whirlpools, bees and other creatures, and low-hanging purple clouds. The forest extends for quite a distance because Purnie has never been to the ocean before. It is lush with foliage, including paka plants, plants that produce pollen and fruit, and tall trees that seem to reach as high as the clouds. From his brothers\u2019 descriptions, Purnie knows what to expect at the beach, but he is still amazed when he sees everything for himself. The forest ends at a rocky knoll formed by petrified logs that overlooks the sea with its orange waves higher than a house and breakers coming onto the shore. There is a flock of birds called spora who land on the beach in a deep glide and humorous three-legged tripons that stand in the water and eat seaweed.

When it was\nnearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now\nhad become familiar.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you?\"\n  \n \n  Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was\nbeyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he\nreturned.\n  \n \n  \"We've made a terrible mistake. We\u2014\" The sounds faded in and out on\nPurnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different\ndirections. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered\nlogs and peer around and under them.\n  \n \n  \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky\nnow, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double\nshadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched\nthe creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of\nthe others.\n  \n \n  Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The\nbeach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering\nwhite square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie\never saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in\nopen-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand\u2014on the\nspot where Purnie had been standing.\n  \n \n  \"My God, he's\u2014he's gone.\"\n  \n \n  Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his\nhand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\n\"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What\ndid you do with him?\"\n  \n \n  The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for\nto them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of\nwas that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around\nin front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n  \n \n  \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that\nyou've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that\nfuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that\ngun!\"\n  \n \n  Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his\nfriends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\nSlowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\ndistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\nthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\nfilled him with hysteria.\n  \n \n  The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\nOthers were pinned down on the sand.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He\nhopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\nshame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\nhis ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?\nPlease get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\ndone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\ntell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\nabout.\n  \n \n  The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Although Purnie is an animal and not a human, he plays a very important role in the story. Through his understanding of the world, we learn that he has never felt real fear before. This makes sense because although he has been warned about stopping time, and he has explicitly been told that it could lead to his death, he decides to go ahead with his birthday plan anyway and stop time and see the ocean. When the humans throw a noose at him in an attempt to capture him, he is shocked to find that his body instinctively runs from it. He doesn\u2019t really experience the fear because he wants to play with them and has no interest in leaving the fun, but his natural impulses as an animal save his life at this moment. Humans have never before visited his planet, so this means that no other animal Purnie has come in contact with has made his body react this way. \nPurnie also demonstrates how evil Forbes is for trying to capture and kill such an innocent and caring animal. When Benson reminds Forbes that it\u2019s illegal to shoot or capture Purnie, Forbes does not care at all. He wants the animal that is emitting radiation because he believes he can make a profit off of him. The value of Purnie\u2019s life means nothing to him. However, as soon as Purnie feels as though his \u201cfriends\u201d are in danger, he is willing to risk his own life by stopping time to help them. Purnie feels guilt, regret, and sorrow when he accidentally causes the petrified logs to fall on the men, yet Forbes has none of those feelings when he shoots Purnie in the leg and causes him pain. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Purnie celebrates his fifth birthday by taking his first-ever trip to the beach to take in the sights and meet new friends with the animals his brothers have told him about. Purnie is a small, kangaroo-like creature with the ability to stop time and an extremely upbeat and friendly attitude. Not only does he want to be friends with every animal he encounters, but he also wants to share his lunch with them and show them his ability to do a headstand. Purnie lives in harmony with the forest and its creatures and contrasts with the human explorers who come to lay claim to his planet. Purnie uses his time-stopping ability to extend his birthday because he feels there is not enough time in the day to enjoy all the wonders life has to offer. When he encounters the humans, he is curious because he has never seen their kind before. He listens to the funny sounds they make and follows them persistently, trying to share his lunch with them and demonstrate his headstand. When Forbes orders the men to capture him, Purnie believes they are simply playing a game, and he obliges by evading them. Even after Forbes shoots him, Purnie maintains his positive view of the humans and is more confused by what he did wrong than he is hurt by his actions. This further demonstrates Purnie's naivete and purity of heart. Although his family had warned him about the fatal danger of using his time-stopping powers for too long, Purnie cares more about the survival of the humans he perceives to be his friends and therefore sacrifices his own life to save them when they are crushed by the petrified logs.",
        "Summary_3": "Purnie is a mischievous creature with the ability to stop and restart time who innocently causes a tragedy that he then tries to set right. Purnie is out for a day of exploration for his birthday when he comes across the humans on the beach. The humans have no interest in him until they discover Purnie is radioactive; then Forbes, the man financing the expedition and claiming the planet as his, orders them to put Purnie in one of their lead boxes. He is excited that animals are radioactive because they can reproduce and provide him with an endless supply of radioactive material to make him extremely wealthy. Purnie doesn\u2019t know this, of course, and tries to engage the men in play with him. When he realizes they want him near the box, he teasingly runs close to it then away again. When Forbes shoots Purnie, Purnie sees the noose coming toward his head and instinctively stops times. This allows him to evade capture, make his way atop the bluff, and watch from a safe distance once he restarts time. The men are puzzled at Purnie\u2019s sudden disappearance but plan to catch him when they see him on the bluff. As they approach, Purnie accidentally triggers a rockslide of the petrified logs that spill onto the men, trapping them where they are. Purnie is horrified at what he has caused as he hears the men\u2019s cries of pain. He also notices that the tide is coming in, and the men will drown, so he stops time again, removes the logs from the men, and drags them onto the beach where they will be safe. After everyone is safe, Purnie restarts time, and men are incredulous to find themselves suddenly freed from the logs and on the beach. Forbes goes insane. Before they leave, Benson goes back to look for Purnie and offers to help him if he is wounded.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Purnie creates the juxtaposition of innocent youth against corrupted power in adults. Purnie\u2019s role is of childlike wonder in trying to interact with what it thinks are new friends along the shoreline - while those very friends attempt to capture and kill it. \n\nBecause Purnie is unable to communicate with humans, it also acts as a mime-like guide to the story, providing many physical actions that convey its emotions rather than language. Purnie\u2019s ability to start and stop time creates pause for the reader to exist in the moments of great emotion that Purnie experiences - joy adventuring to the beach, confusion in trying to be captured, horror in thinking it has killed the humans. Ultimately, this superpower drains Purnie to the point of death.\n"

Disregarding\nthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n  \n \n  Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he\ntugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked\nslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as far\nas his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition\nof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\nhe started time again.

        "Summary_1": "Forbes believes he can control anyone and anything he comes in contact with. His first order of business upon landing on the gorgeous planet is to put up his flag emblazoned with his name. When Benson reminds him that the crew members are interested in taking a moment to look around, Forbes reprimands him for suggesting that they have the right to waste his money. He believes that putting up his flag is a symbol of defeat, and he is incredibly eager to take over a planet he literally just landed on and knows almost nothing about. He incessantly talks about the 17 other planets he has already conquered, and he calls himself a pioneer. Although Forbes definitely makes a lot of money by claiming these planets, he is more interested in the control and fame it brings him than the money he will inevitably make. \nThe first time that Purnie freezes time to escape the noose after Forbes shoots him in the leg, Forbes is incredibly confused but willing to blame the glitch on Benson. He shot Purnie after explicitly being told not to, so he assumes that Benson secretly managed to aid Purnie in getting away. He is furious at this act because capturing the animal emitting radiation is very important to him. He doesn't care if it\u2019s illegal or immoral. He wants control of the planet, the animal, and the crew. \nThe second time that Purnie freezes time, Forbes cannot simply ignore it. He knows that he saw the petrified logs falling down the hill, he knows that he saw several crew members pinned under the logs, about to drown, and he knows that he himself was in a near-death situation one second and saved in the next. There is simply no explanation in his mind for what occurred, and his brain can\u2019t compute the mysterious event.

He uses this opportunity to retreat back to his perch atop the pile of petrified logs. When he unfreezes time again, Forbes and the rest of the crew are astonished as it appears he has disappeared right before their eyes and reappeared atop the logs. As Purnie moves across the log pile, the logs begin to slip and roll down toward the beach, crushing the men and pinning them to the beach. As the surf begins to cover them, Purnie fears they will drown, pauses time, and begins to save them one-by-one as he slowly bleeds out and expends his energy. Once he has removed the logs from all of the crew members, including Forbes, he once more retreats to the top of the hill and collapses, exhausted. His mind un-freezes time, and the men are once more flabbergasted as it appears the logs have disappeared from their bodies in the blink of an eye. Purnie has saved them, but the experience is too baffling and too overwhelming for Forbes to process. He goes mad, and the men carry him away back to the ship.",

After time resumes, Forbes is seen sitting in the water, talking about his seventeen planets that will do anything that he says. However, he says this planet has a mind of its own. Forbes is astonished that the rocks seemingly moved on their own. Forbes laughs continually and comments that he will hold Benson personally responsible.

They attempted to conceal their killing of a farn beast on that trip, however, the word got out and now Extrone has forced them (seemingly against their will) to be the guides for his own trip. Ri and Mia do not turn out to be very good guides. Mia is unsupportive of Extrone and suspicious of his activities and potential plans to violently attack the aliens, and Ri is fearful of that talk and of Extrone himself causing him to be unhelpful as a guide.\n\nExtrone refers to being loved by his \u201csubjects\u201d suggesting he has a position of royalty or power. The military is at his disposal and seem eager to please him. He is highly focused on finding and killing a farn beast any way possible - and attempts sacrificing his guide Ri as bait for the animal to do it. He kills Mia by shooting him in the back after Ri accuses him of intent to kill Extrone, suggesting Extrone is a violent ruler.\n\nExtrone\u2019s focus is on killing a farn beast and this blinds him to the existence of an alien trap on the planet. It is heavily implied that the aliens have intentions to do harm to Extrone, and it is revealed that his fixation on the farn beast led him directly into a trap set by the aliens to capture him.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Extrone, a prominent leader of the humans, has taken his hunting party to track down a farn beast, a newly-discovered creature. His guides are two businessman, Ri and Mia, who were the first to come across and kill a farn beast. They are there begrdugingly, but their fear of Extrone is clear. They arrive on the wrong side of the ridge and are searching for a way to cross it to reach the farn beasts. Ri hears the cough of a farn beast on their side, and Extrone is pleased they won\u2019t have to waste time crossing the ridge. They set up camp there, and Extrone asks Mia and Ri to scout ahead and find farn beast tracks. No one is armed, except for Extrone, so Mia and Ri are extremely cautious not to get too far into the beasts\u2019 territory. They\u2019re sweating as they come across land marred by a rocket\u2019s blast off probably from a year ago. They theorize that it\u2019s the people who discovered the beasts, though they don\u2019t know who. \nRi reveals that they shot their guide after finding the farn beast, but not their pilot. They bicker a little, scared of Extrone and the possibility of him killing them afterward. They agree to hide the blast area from him, but inform him they found tracks instead. A rocket flies over the camp, looking for Extrone. They land near and tell Extrone that an alien ship was spotted on this planet. They were unable to destroy it at the time. Extrone gives out orders to destroy it and then sends them away. Extrone asserts his dominance over Ri after they return. Ri and Mia rest in their sleeping bags, discussing what they need to do about Extrone. \nThe next morning, Extrone\u2019s personal bearer, Lin, presents alien information about the farn beasts. They begin their trek into the forest, people cutting the way for Extrone who managed to kill one small animal with his weapon. Extrone\u2019s men were able to shoot down the alien ship. Lin finds a spoor and leads Extrone to it, revealing on the way that the farn beasts are great hunters. Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to draw the beasts to him. \nWhen he informs Ri of his decision, Ri betrays Mia in a way to guarantee his safety. So, Extrone kills Mia and then uses Ri as bait anyway. After stringing him up and torturing him, his screams eventually draw the farn beast near. A farn beast and its mate appear and charge Ri. The story ends with Extrone holding fire as the farn beast nears, and the alien trap being sprung. \n",
        "Summary_3": "General Extrone is on a hunting trip to kill a farn. To help him track the farn, he has hired two businessmen, Ri and Mia, who actually killed the first farn, which Extrone resents; he wanted to kill the first one. While Ri and Mia are out tracking the farn beast, they talk about how much they hate working for Extrone since he is a self-centered, egotist who cares nothing about anyone except himself. After Ri and Mia killed their farn, they killed their guide to keep word from getting out about it. Now they wonder if their pilot was the one who told others about it. Mia points out to Ri that Extrone might just shoot them after the hunt is over, but Ri says Extrone wouldn\u2019t do that because they aren\u2019t a couple of nobodies. Meanwhile, a low-flying rocket passes overhead and lands; it is part of Extrone\u2019s Ninth Fleet with news that an alien ship has been sighted near the planet where the general is hunting. Extrone refuses to leave with them for someplace safer, instead making it clear he expects them to take care of the problem. Ri and Mia return to camp, and Extrone has Ri give him an update. Extrone makes it clear that the two businessmen had better not have killed the last farn beast and then make Ri say he knows and loves Extrone. Later than night, Mia tells Ri he is afraid Extrone will kill them before he lets them return to civilization. Mia points out lies that Extrone has told, such as that the army tried to plot against him; Mia figured out that the army was helping him. He also thinks Extrone cut off trade with the aliens because he is getting ready to invade them. The next day, Extrone talks with his personal bearer, Lin, who has read an alien manual about the farn beast. When Extrone complains about Ri and Mia, Lin keeps telling him facts about the farn beast. Extrone allows Lin to disagree with him, but Lin always follows his statement with \u201cSir.\u201d Hunting later that day, Lin spies a spoor and shows it to Extrone. When they hear the farn cough, Lin says it\u2019s a good thing they are downwind; otherwise the farn beast would track them down. This gives Extrone the idea of using a human for bait and chooses Ri. When Ri realizes what is planned, he tells Extrone that Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone shoots Mia and still uses Ri for bait, which does lure two farn beasts. Instead of killing them, Extrone waits to see what they will do. The the aliens spring their trap.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Ri and Mia are two businessmen hired as guides by Extrone, a violent, though popular leader, on his mission to hunt farn beasts. They were hired because of their success killing a farn beast during one of their Hunting Club missions. Soon after their arrival on the planet where the hunt takes place, Ri hears a farn beast cough while plotting their course with Extrone, and Extrone sends him and Mia into the forest to track it. Ri and Mia bemoan the fact that they have been hired for this purpose in spite of the fact that neither of them is a professional guide; they merely have hunted a farn beast in the past. As they track the beast, they discover a blast area and cannot identify the source of it, although they do know it wasn't created by one of the Hunting Club's rockets. When they make their way back to camp, they worry about if Extrone will kill them after the hunt in order to keep the discovery of the farn beasts a secret despite the fact that rumors of their existence had already spread. Extrone has killed others in the past. Back at camp, a group of high-ranking officers from the Ninth Fleet visit Extrone to warn him about the presence of a nearby alien spacecraft, fearing it is seeking him out to exterminate him. Extrone orders them to destroy it and scoffs at the idea that he might not be safe on this planet. After the officers leave, Extrone calls Ri into his tent and admits he needs him because he has never seen a farn beast and would have hunted them on alien planets (where he has heard they hunt them frequently) had it been safe for him to do so. It is clear from his conversation with Ri that Extrone is loved by his constituents and hated by his alien enemies. When Ri joins Mia later, they again discuss their fear of being killed after the hunt, and Mia suggests the army purposefully installed Extrone as puppet leader during the anti-military rebellion in order to gain popular support for their eventual attack on the alien system. Ri refuses to believe Mia's theories whether out of fear or denial; either way, Ri and Mia guides Extrone's hunt the next morning, joined by Extrone's personal bearer Lin and several other attendants. Lin warns a dismissive Extrone of the dangers of the farn beasts, and Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to lure them to their spot. In a panic, Ri tells Extrone to use Mia instead, since he had plotted to kill Extrone. Without missing a beat, Extrone kills Mia and continues to use Ri as bait. Lin and Extrone hideaway as Ri screams and draws the farn beasts to their location. Suddenly, the aliens the Ninth Fleet officers had warned Extrone about spring their trap. They had been using Extrone as bait to catch the farn beasts themselves."

The hunt for the farn beast reveals Extrone\u2019s true colors as he kills Mia, one of his guides, and uses the other guide, Ri, as bait to kill a farn beast. The farn beasts also act as a great plot progressor and keep the characters moving forward. ",
        "Summary_3": "The farn beast is the whole reason for the expedition in the story, and it is Extrone\u2019s obsession, so much so that he pays no attention to his army intelligence about aliens in the area near the planet where he is hunting. The farn beast is a rare creature that has only been seen by a few humans and only recently been killed by humans. They wanted to keep it a secret, so they killed their guide before returning home. Now General Extrone wants to kill a farn beast, and he is forcing the two men who killed the last one to be his guides to find one. He is angry that the two men didn\u2019t tell him about finding and killing one. The farn beast is distinguishable by its coughing roar and is known to be dangerous to humans.

Lin calls them the \"particular enemy of men\" although they are also frequently hunted by aliens. As members of the Hunting Club, Ri and Mia hunt a farn beast, and this successful kill draws the attention of Extrone, who hires them as his guides to hunt farn beasts himself. Farn beasts emit loud coughs, which is how Ri determines one of them is nearby in the first place. Later, Lin and Extrone realize there are multiple farn beasts nearby on their hunt when they hear multiple coughs. Extrone's alien enemies not only hunt the farn beasts, but they have also developed a manual for identifying and understanding them; they clearly understand the beasts much better than Extrone.

While discussing Extrone\u2019s love for hunting, Lin claims that no one should hunt for fun, only out of necessity. He argues a little with Extrone, until the farn beasts arrive.

        "Summary_3": "While the two men don\u2019t completely accept each other, they seem to be more accepting of each other than the other characters. In a position of authority, a leader cannot afford to be too friendly with those under him; however, Extrone takes this concept to the extreme and is downright hateful and hard to tolerate. The only person he is somewhat civil to is Lin, and even then, his civility is limited. Extrone treats other people in a very arrogant manner, barking orders at them (\u201cYou! Hey! Bring me a drink!\u201d), making veiled threats (\u201cIt would be a shame if you had killed the last one. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d), and treating them as if they are utterly useless. With Lin, however, Extrone allows him to respectfully disagree with him or contradict him. Extrone acknowledges that very few people will stand up to him like Lin does, and yet it may be Lin\u2019s manner of doing so that enables him to get away with this. Lin does not act afraid of Extrone, and when Extrone drones on about the way people disrespect him, Lin focuses on the topic at hand, the farn beast. When Extrone confronts him about contradicting him, Lin affects an impassive response rather than kowtowing to him. And when Lin says people should only hunt when they have to for food, Extrone says people should hunt for the love of hunting. Lin names it \u201ckilling,\u201d but Extrone corrects him with \u201chunting.\u201d Lin drops the topic as if he knows better than to debate Extrone.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Lin has been Extrone's personal bearer for a while, having accompanied him on several expeditions such as the one on Meizque, and he does Extrone's bidding. However, he is also intelligent and clever and understands how to say the right thing to Extrone to get the reaction he wants; he appears emotionally unaffected by Extrone's bombastic behavior and is matter-of-fact in most of his actions. Lin does his best to educate Extrone about the characteristics and known behavior of the farn beasts and their potential danger to humans. Lin is practical and encourages proper precautions when they get closer to the farn beasts; he guides Extrone to the farn beasts more effectively than Ri and Mia. Lin wrangles Ri when Extrone orders him to be used as bait to catch the farn beasts. For his part, Extrone treats Lin with the same dismissiveness and condescension that he treats any of his associates. However, he does have some amount of deference for Lin and, although he does not absorb much of the information Lin tries to give him, he does listen to much of his practical advice when pursuing the farn beasts."

        "Summary_2": "Hunt the Hunter by Kris Neville takes place on a mostly unexplored planet inhibited by the farn beast and other creatures. The coughing roar of the farn beast can often be heard in the distance. Great sprawling vines, trees, and bushes cover the land, and the heat is oppressive in its thickness. It only gets hotter, too. Once the sun goes down, the breeze dies off too, leaving just stale heat in its wake.

At the same time, alien space ships are seen nearby, and the military wants Extrone to return to an inner planet where he will be safer. The unnamed planet has many features that support wildlife and include land features such as ridges. We know that, in addition to farn beasts, there are birds and arboreal creatures in the forest. The forests are thick with many trees, and it is sweltering, especially in the forest where the foliage stops outside air from entering. There are dense thickets that the men have to hack in order for Extrone to pass through the area. There are gently swaying grasses in some areas, and in the mornings, they can hear the birds singing. While Extrone sleeps in a luxurious tent, the other men sleep under the sky where a smooth-surfaced moon hangs, bisected into twin hemispheres by a central mountain range. The drinking hole is where they see the farns\u2019 prints and where Extrone has Ri tied to a tree to serve as bait.\n\tAnother setting within this setting is Extrone\u2019s tent. Inside it is absolutely luxurious. The bedding is composed of feathers and is surrounded by silk curtains. The flooring is made of tile blocks that have been transported to the planet and laid neatly and smoothly in the ground to create an even floor. There is a chain of crystals hanging from the top of the tent, and the electric lights are powered by a portable dynamo. Extrone seems to have every luxury available to him.\n",

They make camp in a field of grass next to a scrub forest somewhere in the southern region and there is a ridge to their north over which they previously sighted farn beasts. The forest is hot and dense and filled with trees and vines. Military officers from the Ninth Fleet visit Extrone to provide a warning about the sighting of an alien spacecraft; the officers come from the military outpost on a nearby moon. When Extrone invites Ri inside of his tent, the luxuriousness of his lifestyle highlights not only Extrone's wealth but also the glee with which he shows it off: His bed is expensive, full of heavy feathers, and flanked by silken sleep curtains. Solid tile blocks form the base of his floor, and a chain of crystals hangs in the middle of the tent to the left of a thin, hand-carved pole. Electric light brightens the space. Juxtaposed with Extrone's extravagancies, Mia and Ri sleep in sleeping bags under a gnarled tree. During the hunt for the farn beast, Extrone and Lin discover farn beast tracks in a muddy waterhole, and this is where they tie Ri to the base of a scaling tree."

The plan fails when Extrone kills Mia on the spot by shooting him in the back, thus ending their relationship.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Ri and Mia are two businessmen who were on a hunting trip before this current expedition. There, with their guide and pilot, they discovered the farn beast and killed at least one. Extrone hired them to be his guides on his own expedition, seeing as they found the beast in the first place. \nAfter their discovery, Ri and Mia shot their guide but left the pilot alive. This meant that the word about farn beasts spread and soon became a hot topic. Now, Ri and Mia are trapped on this planet with Extrone, a scary and powerful man, and their relationship begins to crack under the weight of all this pressure. \nMia firmly believes that Extrone will kill both of them once this expedition is over. Ri disagrees, choosing to remain optimistic. On one of their guide trips, they discover blast tracks, a sign that others have been here. They choose to not tell Extrone out of fear. \nAfter Mia divulges his plans to expose Extreone for what he really is when they return to civilization. Ri feels nervous about the prospect and tries to shut the conversation down. Later on, when Extrone calls Ri into his tent to use him as bait, Ri betrays Mia and reveals his treacherous plans. Extrone kills Mia quickly and efficiently but uses Ri as bait anyway. Despite their history as hunters and friends, Ri still betrays Mia in order to save his own skin. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Ri and Mia have a friendly camaraderie until the end of the story when Ri lies and tries to convince Extrone to use Mia as live bait for the farn beast rather than himself. Ri and Mia killed the first farn beast in their world, and when Extrone heard this, he hired them for a pittance to be his guides on a hunting expedition for the farn beast. Neither man wants to be there, but they have no choice. When Ri and Mia killed a farn beast, they killed their guide to prevent news of it from leaking, but other people still found out. Mia worries that Extrone will kill them, too, when the hunt is over, but Ri insists that they are too important for that to happen. Ri insists their friends and influence will prevent Extrone from doing that, but Mia counters that Extrone can always claim it was an accident. The two men are suspicious about how Extrone came to power, and Mia suspects that he is planning to invade the aliens and, for that reason, cut off trade with them. Ri disagrees and says the trade discontinuation was to keep an economic balance. While the two men disagree about Extrone\u2019s methods, they both agree that he is a scary guy. At the end of the story, however, when Extrone\u2019s plan to use Ri as live bait for the farn beast becomes clear to him, Ri lies and says Extrone should use Mia as bait because Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone has Ri point out Mia to him and then shoots him and still uses Ri for bait. So Ri gains nothing and causes his friend\u2019s death. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Ri and Mia are two businessmen who are hired by Extrone to serve as guides on his hunting trip because of their association with the Hunting Club and their success in killing one during a recent mission. Although they successfully hunted a farn beast in the past, they are not professional guides by any means. Despite this and the low pay that they receive for their efforts, they feel compelled to meet Extrone's demands out of fear of reprisal. Mia is more assertive and confident than Ri, and he strongly believes that Extrone is a puppet leader installed by the military to ensure the people will support future military action against the aliens. Ri, fearful and timid, does not want to believe Mia's conspiracies and espouses faith in Extrone. Mia further fears that Extrone will kill them once the hunt is over because he does not want them to reveal the location of the farn beasts. Ri's fear of Extrone takes over when Extrone wants to use him as bait to catch the farn beasts, and he throws Mia under the bus by claiming Mia has suggested assassinating Extrone. Extrone immediately kills Mia and uses Ri as bait anyway."

He was glad to be finished.\n  \n \n  At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The\nstreet was dim. Everything was vague.

Yet it drew\nhim on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made\nhim uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened\u2014and fascinated.\n  \n \n  And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.\n  \n<doc-sep>In a gloomy mood, Orison McCall showered and dressed for bed. Eleven\no'clock. Washington should be calling soon, inquiring after the results\nof her first day's spying.\n  \n \n  No call. Orison slipped between the sheets at eleven-thirty. The clock\nwas set; the lights were out. Wasn't Washington going to call her?\nPerhaps, she thought, the Department had discovered that the Earmuffs\nhad her phone tapped.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" a baritone voice muttered.\n  \n \n  Orison sat up, clutching the sheet around her throat. \"Beg pardon?\" she\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the male voice repeated. \"One, two, three; three, two, one.\nDo you read me? Over.\"\n  \n \n  Orison reached under the bed for a shoe. Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n  \n \n  The room was empty.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n  \n \n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n  \n \n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n  \n \n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n  \n \n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n  \n \n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n  \n \n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n  \n \n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n  \n \n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "\nGabriel (Gabe) Lockard, an attractive man, is sitting in a bar with humans and extraterrestrials. He knocks over a man's drink while he talks to a girl. He offers to pay for a new suit, showing off his wealth. The other man reaches to throw his drink at Lockard but is stopped by a third man wearing a gray suit, who seems to know Lockard. This man warns Lockard to be careful, and when he leaves, Lockard tells the woman he's with that he's never seen him before, even though they talked as if they were acquaintances. The stranger visits a locker at a nearby airstation, puts most of his belongings inside, including all forms of identification, and sets the lock to the word \"bodyguard\". He climbs into a helicab, where he pressures the driver into taking him to a zarquil game. This man has been floating around without an identity, but operates as a flying dutchman, floating between zarquil games. Another day, Lockard crashes a helicar on a rainy fall night in a dark corner of a degrading city, and a fat stranger pulls him and his wife out of the helicar before it exploded. The man who saved them has the ID of Dominic Bianchi, a milgot dealer who seems to have disappeared in the past few weeks. Mrs. Lockard warns her husband to be more careful lest something happen to him. It seems the stranger's job is to rotate identities and protect Lockard. On yet another day, a thin stranger chases off a thief with his gun, and checks in on Mr. and Mrs. Lockard. Mrs. Lockard realizes that he is the same man who pulled them out of their aircar crash, and was the man wearing the gray suit at the bar. He has been changing bodies this whole time. She wants to know why, but the stranger suggests she ask Gabriel. She suspects they've been running from this stranger, and has started to be able to identify him, which the stranger is disappointed by as he explains it is not Gabriel he is helping. Because Gabriel is going to run-down cities, the bodies the stranger is getting are not well-vetted, and can't last too long. It turns out the stranger was the original Gabriel Lockard, the implication being that he's trying to protect his original body. As the stranger tries to swap bodies again, he finds that nobody wants the one he's in. He's offered a body that is healthy but likely a criminal, for three times the usual fee, and the stranger accepts the expensive deal. After the bodyswap, he recognizes the man as someone police are ordered to burn on sights. Mrs. Lockard interrogates her husband about his stolen body, which starts an argument. She recognizes he can't get his old body back, but lies and says she'd stay with him if he switched back, and the two talk about how ugly he was. ",

Gabe\u2019s wife asks who the stranger was, and he tells her that he\u2019s never seen him before. \n\nThe stranger hails a cab  and requests to be taken to the zarquil game. The cab driver tells him that he might as well commit suicide, but the stranger insists. \n\nOn a dark and rainy night, Gabe refuses to allow his wife to drive the helicar. When they crash, the stranger, with a brand new look, is right behind them. He pulls them out of the car before it blows up. Mrs. Lockard has a feeling that she has met the stranger before, but she dismisses her thought as ludicrous. When she asks for an introduction, Gabe asks the stranger for his name. He pulls out an ID card with the name Dominic Bianchi on it and explains that Bianchi lost all of his money a few weeks ago, and now he\u2019s nothing. Mrs. Lockard tries to compensate the stranger for saving their lives, but he tells her that he has plenty of money. Gabe promises to be more careful in the future.\n\nThe stranger then makes his way to the zarquil game, which is an illegal activity. The game is run by the Vinzz, and it is very expensive to play. While there, he gains a new body, and this time he has small, angular features. \n\nLater, the stranger approaches Gabe, laying on the ground in an alleyway, and his distressed wife. Mrs. Lockard recognizes the skinny stranger as the same man that has been following them and saving their lives. He admits that he is all of them, and she realizes that the stranger is playing in the zarquil games. The stranger calls a cab so that Gabe won\u2019t freeze to death outside, once again saving his life. \n\nThe stranger then goes to a zarquil game to change his appearance again. The Vinzz tries to turn him away because his body is in poor condition, but he asserts that he has lots of money to fork over. The alien offers him the body of a criminal. The stranger agrees to take the body, and he finds it to be very handsome. He recognizes the new face he wears as one that belongs to a man who will be burned immediately by any police officer he encounters. \n\nMrs. Lockard tells Gabe that she knows that the stranger who has been chasing them is the real Gabe Lockard, and he wants his body back. When the man in Lockard\u2019s body becomes defensive, she assures him that she would stay with him regardless of what his actual body looks like.

        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in a reality where humans can trade bodies through a game called zarquil, thus taking on the physical appearance of a new person while someone else gets their old body. The premise is that the body of Gabriel Lockard is actually inhabited by an unknown person. His wife, Helen, is the one to unravel the story as she begins to discover that \u201cstrangers\u201d (the real Gabe inhabiting the bodies of strangers, changing form repeatedly through the story) keep coming to their rescue. \nThe \u201cstrangers\u201d that Helen starts to realize are a single person (Gabe\u2019s consciousness) changing bodies over time appear when the arrogant and incredibly handsome body of Gabriel Lockard: gets a drink thrown in his face at a bar, crashes his vehicle into a tower with Helen as a passenger, and when he is face down unconscious in an alley. \nHelen first realizes what is happening when the \u201cstrangers\u201d seem deeply concerned that Gabe remain alive. Through their interactions, she comes to realize that Gabe is not actually in his own body, and that the real Gabe is following his body around like a bodyguard, resentful of the person in there and not wanting any harm to come to what he considers his perfect physique. \nThe stranger continues to change forms throughout the story to evade detection by Gabe, though Helen foils that plan. He also does this for the reason of wanting to inhabit a body as perfect as he believes his original body was, hoping to \u201ctrade up\u201d to a body he finds suitable through the process. The last body switch he makes is a dark deal into the body of a wanted criminal that is very handsome and fit. He is happy with the outcome as he thinks he may be able to get away with the crimes this body committed with his cunning wit.\nThe story closes with Helen confronting the body of Gabe with an unknown person inside, in which he confirms that what she knows is true. The person inside Gabe is unkind to her and does not treat her well, and the story ends with her in this predicament, having to make a choice whether to stay or go.\n",

Lockard and the man in the gray suit talk as if they know each other; Lockard acknowledges the stranger is useful to have around, and the stranger, noticing signs of Lockard\u2019s aging, comments Lockard soon might not be worth saving. \nAfter following Lockard to his hotel, the stranger takes a cab to the zarquil games to change his body, something he does after every encounter with Lockard. In the meantime, Gabe and Mrs. Lockart go out in a helicar. When Mrs. Lockart suggests she drive because Gabe is drunk, he insists on driving. He crashes the helicar, and the stranger, now a fat man, rescues him and his wife from the helicar just before it catches on fire.

She does not realize that the Gabe Lockard she knows is not the true Gabe Lockard until she uncovers the mystery of why a shape-changing stranger is always saving their lives. Mrs. Lockard is not part of the seedy underclass, so she has little awareness of the zarquil games and would not know to be on the lookout for an intruder in her husband\u2019s body. \n\nEven before she realizes that the man she is married to is a liar, she is deeply unhappy in the marriage. At one point, the stranger who is chasing them, the real Gabe Lockard, notices that her face is bruised beneath her makeup. She is being abused by her husband, and she feels as though she has no way out of the relationship. Mrs. Lockard also complains that she has been forced to run from these strangers ever since she married Gabe. He won't tell her anything, so she is forced to figure everything out on her own, and she now recognizes that she is constantly on the run.

Compared to him, Mrs. Lockard almost looks plain. She has been married to Gabe for six months. Her husband is rude, coarse, and self-centered, and she regrets marrying him. He isn\u2019t above striking her cheek violently when they argue. For instance, Mrs. Lockard tries to get along with Gabe, gently offering to drive the helicar when Gabe has had too much to drink.

After the stranger saves her and Gabe from the thief, she opens up to the stranger and confesses she feels like Gabe is looking for trouble. This is also when she realizes the stranger is definitely the same person from the bar, the wreck, and now the attempted theft. She opens up to the stranger and admits that Gabe is running from something. She wonders what it would be like to change bodies with another person in a zarquil game and escape from Gabriel, but she realizes her body is a good one and would hate to give it up. She begins to realize how closely connected the stranger is to her and Gabe. She accepts the stranger, although his significance is a secret her husband keeps from her, and her acceptance spurs the stranger to admit that his current body, thin and sickly, will only last another four or five months. She later asks her husband why he doesn\u2019t give up the body, and he skeptically accuses her of wanting to be the real Gabe\u2019s wife because then her husband would be sound in mind and body. She denies thinking of herself with the real Gabe and says she would stay with her husband in his \u201creal\u201d body. When her husband admits he doesn\u2019t know where his real body is and thinks whoever has it might have killed himself after looking in the mirror, Mrs. Lockard comments that his real body must have matched his character and that it is a shame he could only change one of them, not both. Her husband realizes that she is dissatisfied with him, and her interaction with the stranger helps her see her husband as he really is. Compared to her husband, the stranger is much kinder, more honest, and stable. \n"

It was expensive looking baggage.\n  \n \n  Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\nflorid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\nthe open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\nclamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\nhe backed out of the room.

He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\nsat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\nthe corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\noversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\nglanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n  \n \n  \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\nout?\"\n  \n \n  Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth.

        "Summary_1": "The stranger in the gray suit at the bar in the beginning of the story happens to be the original Gabriel Lockard, and it is hinted that the original Lockard only switched bodies because the current one had convinced him to when they'd had too much to drink. The stranger is keeping an eye on the current Gabriel Lockard to protect the body from harm. He does this by participating in zarquil games, run by the alien race the Vinzz, which allows him to swap bodies with other people. If he is in a reputable area, there are careful checks to make sure that these bodies are healthy, but he ends up with a sick body partway through the story, which forces him to take the body of a criminal as his only option because nobody will buy the sick body from him. The stranger's desire to protect his original body pushes him to become obsessed with this task, and it is his only real goal. He follows Lockard throughout the story, switching bodies every time he is seen, which forces Lockard and his wife to flee from him, staying constantly on the run. Lockard is used to this stranger being around, and tries to avoid making him angry, but there is a sense that he is sick of being saved and wants to live his own life. Lockard even offers to buy the stranger a drink at the beginning to try to work something out, seemingly exhausted from being followed. His single-mindedness is shown by the fact that the stranger's password on his locker is \"bodyguard\", in reference to his original body.",
        "Summary_2": "The stranger in the gray suit is the real Gabriel Lockard. He managed to lose his body through the illegal game known as zarquil, and he desperately wants it back. The stranger thinks of himself as Gabe Lockard\u2019s bodyguard, and he uses the term as the passcode for the locker where he keeps his valuables. His life\u2019s mission is to guard Gabe\u2019s body and get it back so that he can be himself once more. In order to do this, he follows the fake Gabe Lockard and his wife around town to make sure that he is treating his body nicely. Fake Gabe Lockard frequently gets into fights, accidents, and other situations that could lead to his death or irreparably damage his body, and the stranger spends nearly all of his waking hours keeping tabs on him and rescuing him from destruction. \n\nThe stranger seems sinister at first, especially since he goes to seedy areas of town where the Vinzz run illegal zarquil games. He uses his immense wealth to purchase other peoples\u2019 bodies. However, his motivation for continuously changing bodies is to keep his secret from the fake Gabe Lockard. He does not want the man who stole his body to be able to recognize him and kill him. Although he has not found the perfect solution to his problem, he is merely doing what he can to survive, protect his true body, and try to get it back. The stranger treats Gabe\u2019s new wife well, and he even tells her the truth about his predicament. If he did not have the incredible amounts of cash he has, he would not be able to keep up with this plan. But he is able to use his money to keep buying new bodies and chasing around Gabe. \n",

It is revealed that this stranger is actually Gabe himself who is continuously changing physical appearance by playing zarquil. He tries to take on bodies of greater and greater physical beauty until he can find one that is as good as the body he left, which he considers to be a perfect physical form. \n\nThe stranger is significant because he ultimately provides the key information that could liberate Helen from a marriage where she is treated poorly and gets into dangerous situations that could ultimately get her killed if she stays with him. \n\nThe stranger also represents the great lengths humans are willing to go to for pursuing or maintaining physical beauty or health. The game required to change form is dangerous and illegal, but the stranger continues to return to it for the allure of a better form.\n",

Actually, the stranger is not protecting the person in Gabe Lockart\u2019s body, but the body of Gabe Lockart. The stranger shows up in the bar and protects Gabe when another man wants to throw a drink on Gabe; he also shows up and pulls Gabe and his wife from the wreckage of their helicar. He saves them from a would-be thief and calls for a cab to take them to where they are staying to prevent Gabe from freezing to death. The stranger follows Gabe wherever he goes, protecting his body.

        "Summary_1": "An alien race called the Vinzz, from Altair's seventh planet, run the zarquil games as a way to make money so that they can buy slaves. Through these games, humans are able to swap bodies so they can experience what it is like to live as someone else. People who participate frequently are known as flying dutchmen, and the stranger in the story is called this a few times. These games are illegal and dangerous, and you must have a lot of money to participate. In larger cities with more resources and oversight, all of the potential bodies go through a detailed vetting process to make sure that the body in question does not have any illnesses or a criminal past. When the stranger ends up with a sick body near the end of the story, his only option is to accept a body with a criminal past because nobody will accept an ill body at a reputable game. Public perception shows that society looks down on these games. The cab driver that the stranger meets explicitly says that he looks down on dutchmen, saying he hates them, and very reluctantly takes the stranger to a zarquil game because he is promised the money and he knows the stranger has a gun. It is this game that caused the original Gabriel Lockard to lose his body and identity, and it is through this game that he rotates through nameless people in order to follow the new Lockard to keep an eye on the body. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The zarquil games are illegally run by the Vinzz, an alien race. The illegal operation has such a terrible reputation that one of the cab drivers the stranger encounters suggests that he kill himself rather than playing. The cab driver almost refuses to bring him to the games, but he sees the amount of cash the stranger is holding and agrees to do his bidding. Many people in the society know nothing about zarquil because it\u2019s an underground game that people with good reputations do not take part in. The stranger is known as a \u201cdutchman,\u201d which is a term for someone who plays zarquil all the time for the rush of it. \n\nZarquil is an interesting phenomenon because both the victim and the perpetrator are both considered guilty. The game is very expensive to play, and that\u2019s why the Vinzz spend their time running the activity for humans. The Vinzz use the money they make to return to their home planet of Vinau and purchase slaves. The aliens rarely get in trouble for hosting the games because the Vinzz live about 2,000 years, and therefore no punishment would be worthwhile. The Vinzz are not subjected to capital punishment because the humans don\u2019t know if their weapons are good enough to kill them. \n\nMales are given male bodies, and females are given female bodies. The Vinzz do not play \u201cmixed games\u201d and switch up genders, even though there is surely a market for that. Humans are also not allowed to trade bodies with aliens. The Vinzz feel that if they successfully traded a human body for an alien one, the humans would become outraged and start a war over the matter. Some seedy zarquil games include private purchases of criminal bodies. Criminals do not pass the standard testing and must be bought in secret. \n\nThe zarquil games are an important part of the story because Gabe Lockard loses his body to the stranger in one of these illegal games. The stranger, or the real Gabe Lockard, then uses zarquil to continuously change bodies to go undetected by the fake Gabe Lockard. He wants to get his real body back, and in order to do that he must not let the fake Gabe Lockard know his true identity. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Zarquil is an extremely illegal \u201ccrime against nature\u201d sport which is akin to a game of musical chairs. Instead of trading chairs, the game is a high consequence one where humans trade bodies. Supposedly the entrants to the game have a physical health check to ensure the participants get into bodies free of disease, but this proves to not be well regulated as the stranger receives several bodies which he thinks are \u201cdiseased\u201d.\n\nThe sport is run by aliens, Vinzz, from Altair\u2019s seventh planet that have no regard for the welfare of the humans playing, only the profits. The game persists on Terra (where humans live in the story) because there is no capital punishment that can be brought upon the Vinzz, as they live over 2000 years, making prison sentences useless to discourage them from running the game.\n\nThe games are significant because they allow humans to escape their lives by changing into completely different identities. This can enable criminals to escape the law, or for a single person to follow others undetected by continuously changing appearances.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The zarquil games are an illegal activity played by people referred to as dutchmen who go from one game to another seeking the thrills they get from it. Part of the thrill of the game was the unknown; players don\u2019t know for sure what kind of body they will end up with. The games are very expensive and are run by the Vinzz, who are strange beings from Altair\u2019s seventh planet Vinau. The Vinzz have no concerns for the humans playing their games; they are running the games strictly for the money they can make from them so that they can return to Vinau and buy many slaves. The Vinzz live for around two thousand earth years and bodies mean little to them; they care nothing about a human\u2019s body. The Vinzz are not barred from coming to Earth to run their games because the trade between the two planets is so valuable that they maintain peace. In the games, people exchange bodies. The Vinzz are supposed to vet everyone who plays to make sure their bodies are healthy, but they have been known to cut corners when profits are lagging. This explains why the stranger ends up as the sickly, thin man who only has four or five months left to live. \nThe zarquil games are significant in the story because that is how the stranger lost his body and name to the current Gabe Lockard. Apparently, the stranger drank too much too many times and played the zarquil game, losing his body and identity. He continues playing the game, changing his identity after every interaction with the current Gabe. The stranger isn\u2019t sure whether he keeps changing after interacting with the current Gabe because of his interaction or because none of the subsequent bodies feel right to him. Perhaps he just wants to one day obtain a body that is as close to perfection as his original body was. \n"

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between the stranger and Gabe Lockard in the story \"Bodyguard\"?",
        "Article": " \n  Bodyguard\n  \n \n  By CHRISTOPHER GRIMM\n  \n \n  Illustrated by CAVAT\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction February 1956.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course\n    \n   a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that\n    \n   he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!\n   \n \n \n \n  The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did\nthe light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in\nthe gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the\nhumans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and\narrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior\nto anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was\naccustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was\nalmost ordinary-looking.\n  \n \n  As for the extraterrestrials\u2014it was a free bar\u2014they were merely\namused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably\nhideous.\n  \n \n  Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a\nshort man standing next to the pair\u2014young, as most men and women were\nin that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though\nnot death\u2014but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic\nsurgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.\n  \n \n  The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his\nclothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather\nugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one\u2014or at least he felt\nhe was, which was what mattered.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, colleague,\" Gabe said lazily. \"All my fault. You must let me\nbuy you a replacement.\" He gestured to the bartender. \"Another of the\nsame for my fellow-man here.\"\n  \n \n  The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth\nhastily supplied by the management.\n  \n \n  \"You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,\" Gabe said, taking out\nhis wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look\nat them. \"Here, have yourself a new suit on me.\"\n   \n   You could use one\n   \n  was implied.\n  \n \n  And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,\nwas too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just\nset before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's\nhandsome face.\n  \n<doc-sep>He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;\ntall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to\nmatch the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many\npeople who might find this one preferable. No identification in the\npockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it\nwas a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful\nstudent of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from\ntime immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he\nmight one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of\nthe men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though\nnot an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the\npolice had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital\npunishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the\nman in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily,\nnor whom the police intended to capture easily.\n  \n \n \n   This might be a lucky break for me after all\n   \n  , the new tenant thought,\nas he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious\nrude health, was not a very comfortable fit.\n   \n   I can do a lot with a\nhulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe\nI'll be able to get away with it.\n   \n \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don't try to fool me! I know you\ntoo well. And I know you have that man's\u2014the real Gabriel\nLockard's\u2014body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she\nwatched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.\n  \n \n  Lockard\u2014Lockard's body, at any rate\u2014sat up and felt his unshaven\nchin. \"That what he tell you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, he didn't tell me anything really\u2014just suggested I ask you\nwhatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he\nobviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to\nsee his body spoiled.\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   is\n   \n  a pretty good body, isn't it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles\nand made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved\nat having someone with whom to share his secret.\n  \n \n  \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking\nat him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you're coursing.\nGabe, why don't you...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.\n\"You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be\n   \n   his\n   \n  wife then. That would be\nnice\u2014a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little\nmore than you deserve?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,\" she said truthfully enough, for\nshe hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. \"Of course I'd\ngo with you,\" she went on, now knowing she lied, \"when you got your ...\nold body back.\"\n  \n \n \n   Sure\n   \n  , she thought,\n   \n   I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and\nthrill-mills.\n   \n  Actually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only\nonce, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go\nwith him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash\nthat experience from her mind or her body.\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?\"\nshe went on. \"You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose,\ndoes he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't want to know!\" he spat. \"I wouldn't want it if I could get\nit back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he\nlooked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.\n\"Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a\nhulk I had!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she said incautiously. \"You must have had a body to\nmatch your character. Pity you could only change one.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,\nwhich was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and\nhis was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket\ncloser about her chilly body. \"Aren't you going to introduce your\u2014your\nfriend to me, Gabe?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know who he is,\" Gabe said almost merrily, \"except that he's\nno friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I have a name.\" The fat man extracted an identification\ncard from his wallet and read it. \"Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and\nDominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail\nmilgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks\nago, and now he isn't ... anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"You saved our lives,\" the girl said. \"I'd like to give you some token\nof my\u2014of our appreciation.\" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier\nwith deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only\ncasually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation\nheld little gratitude.\n  \n \n  The fat man shook his head without rancor. \"I have plenty of money,\nthank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,\" he addressed her husband,\n\"if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the\nfuture! Sometimes,\" he added musingly, \"I almost wish you would let\nsomething happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?\"\n  \n \n  Gabriel shivered. \"I'll be careful,\" he vowed. \"I promise\u2014I'll be\ncareful.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,\nthe fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi\ndriver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the\ncommission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others\nhad been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate\nor despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known\ncolloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from\none zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you\ncould call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it\nextended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.\nPerhaps\u2014and this was the most likely hypothesis\u2014he just didn't care.\n  \n \n  Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course\u2014so much so that there were\nmany legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word\nimplied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so\ndeliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of\n\"crimes against nature.\" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to\nzarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly\napplied. And this was one crime\u2014for it was crime in law as well as\nnature\u2014in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;\notherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The stranger is actually the original Gabriel Lockard, and the man we know as Lockard now is the man who took this body a while ago. The new Lockard has some sense of who the stranger is, though he knows he will never recognize him because the stranger switches bodies frequently. The stranger is keeping an eye out on his original body, trying to protect it, with a bit of hope that he may one day get it back. They have a tenuous and superficial relationship, with the new Lockard being somewhat hesitant about the stranger's involvement in his life. The stranger makes it clear that it is not Lockard he is protecting, but just the body he is in. Through this story, the stranger keeps a man from throwing a glass in Lockard's face at a bar, pulls Lockard and his wife out of a helicar crash, and stops a robbery from happening. There is bitterness and exhaustion on both sides of this relationship, and at the beginning of the story the new Lockard tries to offer the stranger a drink so they can sort things out, but the stranger refuses and it seems he would only be appeased if he had his original body back. ",
        "Summary_2": "The stranger follows Gabe Lockard and his wife around everywhere they go in order to protect them. The stranger used to be the real owner of Gabe Lockard's body, but he lost it in a game of zarquil. Since then, he has made it his life's mission to protect his former body from harm. When an angry man at a bar almost assaults Gabe, the stranger stops the man from hitting Gabe in the face. When Gabe crashes his helicar into a beacon tower, the stranger is right behind the vehicle, and he pulls Gabe and his wife out of the crashed car before it blows up. When Gabe lies unconscious in the snow on a freezing night in an alleyway, the stranger shows up and calls him a cab to get his body back home in the warmth. \n\nGabe knows exactly why the stranger is following him and saving his life, but he refuses to tell his wife, Mrs. Lockard, the reason behind the strange behavior. However, Mrs. Lockard continues asking the stranger questions and eventually uncovers the truth. She realizes that she's married to the fake Gabe Lockard, and that he is a liar and a manipulator. ",
        "Summary_3": "The stranger is Gabe\u2019s consciousness inhabiting the bodies of other people. Gabe left his own body in unknown circumstances, and now his body is inhabited by someone else. The relationship between them is not a shared mutual experience. The person in Gabe\u2019s body is largely indifferent to the help from the stranger and does not recognize it is the same person sharing care towards him over time. The stranger (the real Gabe) feels a mix of protectiveness for his body and a deep resentment of the new person that is inside of it.\n\nThe stranger monitors \u201cGabe\u201d closely like a bodyguard and cares deeply about his body continuing to exist, even calling a cab so it doesn\u2019t freeze to death at one point. Potentially he does this with the hope that he can one day get back into it. The stranger continues to follow and save the body of \u201cGabe\u201d while simultaneously changing physical forms through playing zarquil. This serves both to try to avoid being detected by Gabe and Helen (ultimately foiled when Helen figures it out), and to attempt to enter a physical form that is as perfect as he felt his original body was.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Gabe Lockard in the story is actually a man inhabiting the body and adopting the identity of the real Gabriel Lockard. The real Gabe Lockard is the stranger in the gray suit in the bar, the fat man who pulls Gabe and Mrs. Lockard from their wrecked helicar, the thin, sickly man who saves Gabe and Mrs. Lockard from the would-be thief, and the handsome, dark, coarse-featured hulking man at the end of the story. The stranger follows Gabe and Mrs. Lockard from town to town, acting like a kind of bodyguard for Gabe to protect him from the harm he can do to himself and from other dangers. Apparently, at some time in the past, the real Gabe Lockard crossed paths with the man who now inhabits his body, and they had drinks together. The real Gabe comments that he drank with the current Gabe \u201conce too often\u201d and says that things worked out well for the current Gabe. Gabe Lockard\u2019s body is incredibly handsome and attracts attention wherever he goes. The current Gabe, though, is coarse, rude, and self-centered; he has been moving from town to town to get away from the real Gabe who is following him, protecting Gabe\u2019s body. It seems that the real Gabe hopes to get his real body back at some point in the future.\n"

        "Summary_1": "On the surface of the moon, the American base (Freedom 19) is headed by Major Winship, with his three men, Captain Wilkins, Captain Lawler, and Lieutenant Chandler. The Soviets of Base Garagin are conducting a seismic test to learn more about the depths of the moon. The Americans protested it, as their base is not as strongly built, but the Russians went ahead anyway. With a language barrier and poor communication, the Americans don\u2019t know when they are going to perform the test, so they stand outside in their suits waiting. After a few hours, a moonquake occurs, rippling through the surface. The quake caused a leak in their base, which Winship tries and fails to fix with a marker and a plastic sheet. He complains that the Russians did this on purpose, to try and force them off the moon, but they have three weeks of emergency air. They can try and fix it. \nThey are unable to use the transmission since there is no air in the base. Winship orders his men to find the caulking solution, but it has hardened and dried out. He orders Lawler and Chandler to make the 60-minute-round-trip journey to Base Garagin to ask for help. Though Soviet General Finogenov denies it, Winship still wonders if this was intentional. Wilkins and Winship share a meal of gross nutrition tablets. \nWilkins, the resident tech, hooks Winship up to the radio within his suit, so he can speak into the radio. With all the complicated wiring, Winship\u2019s air supply is cut off, and he motions to Wilkins to fix it. Earth is on the line, but he tries to not make his problem known. After Wilkins fixes it, Winship informs them of their difficulties and is told that a replacement could arrive in 10 days and that the Russians formally apologized. \nChandler and Lawler arrive with a 55-gallon barrel of caulking agent, along with another compound that must be mixed in. Displeased by the Russian\u2019s excessiveness, the team figures out a way to successfully mix it. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, while the rest move the barrel inside the dome with great difficulty. They mix the barrel and quickly realize that it is a chemical epoxy, one that reacts to temperature. The heat of the mixer and the dome causes the epoxy to heat up drastically. The men escape to the airlock and watch as the barrel explodes, the fire it causes using up all their remaining oxygen. \n",
        "Summary_2": "An American man named Major Winship learns that there will be an underground blast the following day. He calls Base Gagrin, the Soviet Union\u2019s dome, to request that they relay the exact timing of the explosion. The person who answers cannot speak English, so Winship hangs up. Winship and his three crew members, Lawler, Wilkins, and Chandler, have no way of knowing when the explosion will be over because they are on the moon. Winship\u2019s suit stops working, and his body starts to overheat. Although he knows it\u2019s a risk, he decides to leave the safety of the dome so that he can cool down. He can\u2019t stand the excessive heat and thinks that the explosion has already occurred.\n\nWhen Winship immerses himself in the moon\u2019s environment, he successfully cools down. Within seconds, however, he feels the explosion. The men hear several minutes of static on their communication devices. They realize that their capsule has a dome and is losing pressure. Winship tries to cover the hole with a plastic sheet, but it doesn\u2019t work. He reenters the dome and speaks to the Soviets on the phone. Their leader lets him know that they suffered zero damage and suggests that it\u2019s because their dome is stronger and superior to the Americans\u2019. Winship accuses them of purposefully failing to communicate, and the Soviet denies it. The men attempt to use some calk to fix the hole, but it is useless because it has already been exposed to air. \n\nAlthough the Americans hate to rely on the Soviets for any type of help, the crew has no choice at this point. Lawler and Chandler take the land car to the Soviet base to get supplies to patch the hole. Winship cannot travel because of his busted suit, and Wilkins stays behind with him. They share a meal and complain about how the Soviets have a much nicer dome than they do, and their leader has a real wooden desk, among other nicer amenities. Some time later, Winship calls Earth. He tells the Americans on the ground about the leak in their dome. The man on the other end tells Winship that the Soviets have apologized for the incident, but Winship still isn\u2019t convinced of their sincerity. \n\nLawler and Chandler return with a 55-gallon drum of the calking agent, and this shocks Wilkins and Winship. They need only a very small amount, and this massive drum is difficult to carry and maneuver. Again, Winship wonders if the Soviets are playing tricks with the Americans. The team uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, but the mixture gets incredibly hot and starts turning bright red. Wilkins realizes that the compound is an epoxy, and the men need to exit the dome immediately. He yells at everyone to evacuate. The Americans are very worried that the drum of calk is going to blow up like a bomb. Moments later, it does. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with four Americans in spacesuits on the moon waiting outside of their dome as the Russians conduct a seismic test involving some explosions. Pinov is the Russian on the emergency line, but he does not speak English, so the Americans don't know when it will be safe to enter the dome again. It was hot outside the dome, and the suits' cooling systems could only do so much. Major Winship got tired of waiting and wanted to cool off, so he entered the dome, but as soon as he did so he was thrown off his feet from an explosion. Soon after, some static blocked communications for a minute or two, but then the men had a new problem: the dome was losing pressure, so they were losing air. After their best attempt at patching the hole, they got in touch with the Russians who had not sustained any damage. Major Winship had no patience for General Finogenov, even though the Russian was seemingly embarrassed that there had been a quake caused by his test, as he had promised therew ould not be. Lt. Chandler found the squeeze tubes that they could use to patch the rupture, but they were no longer any good, so Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler headed to Base Gagarin in their land car to ask to borrow calking compound from the Russians.  Major Winship and Capt. Wilkins figured they may as well report back to Earth, but once their communications connect, Major Winship realized he is on emergency air and tries to get help from Capt. Wilkins, but those on Earth heard Winship lose air and gasp. Wilkins caught on just in time, and updated those on Earth as they swaped out their oxygen supplies in their suits. Earth requested a report in three hours, confirming that the dome's leak hadn't been repaired, and Winship was relieved the Soviet didn't have to step in to help with his air issue. When the others returned with the fifty-five gallon drum of calking compound, they marveled at how much the Soviets had on hand, and then moved to make an electric mixer to prepare the compound. They tried to move the drum inside to mix it, but there wasn't room, and they tried to move it back out, so all of the men were sweating again. As they discussed how best to proceed in patching the dome, it occured to Wilkins that it could be a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, and just then they realized that the epoxy had become rock-solid and hot. Wilkins threw out orders to try to protect the men from the impending explosion, but he watched the drum of compound melt, and eventually the air tank started to heat up too. A quick burst of flame flashed inside the dome, leaving the men stranded without air at the end of the story. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Major Winship and his crew stationed at the American moonbase Freedom 19 await a subterranean atomic explosion resulting from a test conducted by their Russian counterparts at Base Gagarin. According to the Russians, the test will help them determine the composition of the moon by analyzing the resultant seismic activity. However, Major Winship suspects the Russians, led by General Finogenov, are conducting the tests in order to purposefully sabotage American efforts to fortify their moon presence. They struggle to communicate with the Russian base as they await word on the status of their test, and when Major Winship goes back inside the dome to call them again, he is suddenly knocked over by movements of the moon's surface, signifying completion of the test. After the quakes settle, the crew discovers a leak in the protective dome, which causes air to slowly seep out. Luckily, they have an emergency air supply to last three weeks, but they lose a significant amount of calking that could be used to repair the leak. When a plastic sheet fails to patch the damage, Lt. Les Chandler searches for squeeze tubes that can ostensibly repair it. However, he discovers that the paste inside requires air in order to harden and some of the tubes have hardened already. Captain Skip Lawler accompanies Lt. Chandler to Base Gagarin in order to ask for calking that might help repair the patch. In their absence, Major Winship bemoans to Captain Larry Wilkins the luxury in which the Russians live on Base Gagarin compared to their discomfort in the cramped quarters of Freedom 19. He continues to muse about his theory that General Finogenov intentionally caused the explosion to harm their base and cause them to vacate the moon. As they await Lawler and Chandler's return, Capt. Wilkins calls Earth on the radio transmitter so that Winship can report the test explosion and the resulting damage. While he talks, he suddenly runs out of his emergency supply of air, and Wilkins refills it for him. Earth promises to restore their air supply in ten days. When Lawler and Chandler return with the calking compound, the crew spends a good amount of time engineering a large, mechanical mixer since the compound comes in a massive, heavy barrel and must be mixed together in order to use it properly. As Captain Wilkins begins mixing the compound, he suddenly realizes that it is a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin. The resin hardens, and the crew rushes out of the dome just before it melts, tips over the barrel, and ignites the air tank next to it, causing a massive explosion. Now the crew is left without any supply of air, and their only hope is an emergency supply still ten days from arriving."

        "Summary_1": "As can be seen from the beginning, Base Gagarin and the small group of Americans have a slightly contentious relationship. Even the title of the story, The Winning of the Moon, emphasizes the undercurrent of war and competition that informs the way they interact with each other. \nThe story begins with potentially purposeful miscommunication between the Russians and the Americans. The Soviet base is running an underground seismic wave test, the likes of which could release after-shocks and tremors. Such a quake could damage the American dome, meager in comparison with Base Gagarin. The Soviets put Pinov on the line, who only speaks Russian. Without the ability to communicate, the Americans were stuck outside on the moon for hours, waiting to see if the seismic eruption could be seen or felt. Feeling like idiots, one goes inside, just as an aftershock causes a leak in their dome. They instantly blame the Russians, especially since the Americans protested such a test. \nThis series of unfortunate events continues as the Americans quickly realize that their supplies are not able to fix the leak. They must ask the Russians for help, even after complaining to their home base about their actions. \nBase Gagarin is huge compared to the American dome. General Finogenov even has a wooden desk in his office, along with other earthly amenities that the Americans have been deprived of. The Russians have been on the moon for six years longer than the Americans, which could explain their extensive supplies. \nThey give the Americans a 55-gallon mixture to fix the leak, however, the language barrier prevents them from realizing what kind of epoxy it is. This miscommunication leads to the barrel exploding and further destroying the American dome. It\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s not smooth sailing on the moon. \n",
        "Summary_2": "When Winship calls the Soviets to discuss the exact timing for the underground explosion, Pinov, the person who answers the call, cannot speak English. This makes Winship frustrated. When Captain Wilkins suggests to Captain Winship that he say the word \u201chelp\u201d into the phone so that the Soviets will know it\u2019s serious, Winship says he would rather die. This suggests that there\u2019s a power dynamic between the two nations, and Winship, as an American, does not want to appear weak in front of the Soviets. Winship wants to keep his American crew safe, but his pride is equally important at this point. As a result of Winship\u2019s refusal to say the word \u201chelp,\u201d he ends up stepping outside of the dome before the explosion occurs. \n\nLater, Winship called General Finogenov, the Soviet leader, to report some damage to their dome. The General responds by explaining that the Soviets have a stronger dome, and Winship accuses Finogenov of deliberately cutting the ties of communication to keep the Americans guessing and jeopardize their safety. Finogenov profusely denies Winship\u2019s claim and offers to help in any way possible. \n\nWinship is highly suspicious of the Soviets, and especially suspicious of Finogenov\u2019s incredible working space in the dome. He has a wooden desk, a chair, and one hundred square feet to move around in. It appears to Winshp that Finogenov cares only about his own comfort and not about the safety of his American counterparts. When Winship has to call the Americans on Earth to let them know about the air leak, he is concerned that the Soviets are listening in on his call. He and his men do not want to wait 10 days for the other Americans to send them supplies to fix the leak, so their only real choice is to rely on the kindness of the Soviets. This makes Winship sick to his stomach, as he loathes asking them for help and potentially looking weak. \n\nIt appears that Winship\u2019s suspicions are merited when the Soviets send over a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix a very small leak in the Americans\u2019 dome, and they do not give the Americans proper instructions for how to prepare and use the chemicals. The crew uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, and the epoxy mixture turns bright red and blows up. \n",
        "Summary_3": "There are seven Soviets and four Americans on the moon in this story, and there is definitely an issue of a balance of power. The Soviets have been there for six years longer than the Americans have, and have way more space set up for their equipment and living. The Americans operate out of one 500 square foot dome, and the Soviets have a 3000 square foot dome and two smaller ones (that are each still larger than the American one). The Americans think they have better space suits, that are at least less bulky, but don't have the amenities like the nice furniture or the fresh plants. Things are very tense over the radio: Major Winship seems constantly angry while communicating with the Soviets, and the Russians act polite and apologetic when things go terribly wrong, even if it's unclear how much happened on purpose. On the day of the seismic test, the one Soviet who does not speak English is the one who is in charge of emergency communication, which Winship thinks was on purpose. The Soviets have a lot more electric power, and say that their experiments are all for purely scientific purposes, even if the Americans think the Soviets are trying to drive them out. The Americans have to rely on the Soviets for emergency supplies; they hope not to have to ask for air, but do retrieve a drum of calking compound to aid in the dome repairs which eventually causes an even larger problem as their air supply is burnt out. ",
        "Summary_4": "Although the two groups both operate bases on the moon, they live very different lives and struggle to effectively communicate with each other. While one large dome and three smaller ones comprise the Soviet Base Gagarin, the American Freedom 19 base is one cramped dome where the four-person crew lives and works.  The seven-person crew at Base Gagarin live in luxury compared to the American crew and have hot tea, better supplies, and more space to live and work. Major Winship expresses consistent frustration with the inability to communicate with Pinov during the atomic test, and he is deeply suspicious about General Finogenov's motives regarding the test in the first place. Winship does not trust when Finogenov insists the tests are being conducted for purely scientific purposes, and the results of the study will be made available in the technical press. For his part, Finogenov is deeply apologetic when the test causes a leak in Freedom 19 and therefore a drop in air pressure, but Winship still doesn't trust him. He believes it is all part of a Soviet plan to sabotage their mission and expel them from the moon. Winship's misgivings appear to have some truth (or else the whole incident reveals the incompetence of the American crew) when the Soviet base supplies the Americans a large batch of what they believe to be a calking compound in order to repair the air leak. The compound turns out to be a highly explosive material that combusts when it makes contact with the American air tank, thus completely depleting its air supply."

The moon itself has a fairly uneven surface, especially after the moonquake rips through its bases. \nMost of the story takes place inside of the American base, a mere 500 square feet. It is cramped inside, filled to the brim with equipment, tools, and supplies necessary for the moon. The American men slept on bunks that rose up from the floor. Cables hung from the ceiling and snaked across the walls, bringing energy into the dome using solar power. The base itself is in the shape of a dome with an airlock leading to the outside. \nThe Russian base, Base Gagarin, is incredibly different. They\u2019ve got three buildings that make up the base, the biggest of which is 3,000 square feet. With luxuries like wooden furniture, fresh lemons from Earth, and nutmeg, the Soviet base has everything the Americans lacked. \n",
        "Summary_2": "\u201cThe Winning of the Moon\u201d takes place on Earth\u2019s moon, where both the Americans and the Soviets have built domes that house crews for years at a time. There is no oxygen on the moon\u2019s surface, so it\u2019s very important that the crew members have strong suits with plenty of emergency air canisters. In this story, the Soviets\u2019 explosion creates a leak in the Americans\u2019 dome, which poses a major problem. The Americans housed in the dome will die if they cannot fix the leak in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThe Americans\u2019 dome is small and cramped. There is a ton of necessary equipment, and not a lot of room to move around for the four crew members. The men sleep in bunk beds. The Soviets\u2019 dome, however, is much nicer and roomier. Their home is called Base Gagarin, and it\u2019s located about 10 miles away from the Americans. It is much sturdier, and as a result, it does not spring a leak after the purposeful detonation is over with. The Soviet General has a real wooden desk in his office and a real wooden chair, and the norm is to use aluminum furniture. The Soviets have lots of space to move around, and they look down upon the Americans for their less luxurious space. \n\n",

These bases are ten miles apart, which is a thirty-minute trip by land car. The dome that the Americans live and work in is very small, only 500 square feet, but the Soviets have one large dome and two smaller ones which gives them much more space. It is hot on the surface of the moon in the space suits, so the Americans have to be inside the dome to be able to cool off. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place at Freedom 19, an American moonbase. An airlock leads into a five hundred square foot dome on the surface of the moon filled with various kinds of equipment, a table, an air tank, and radio transmitter. The dome is powered by solar cells affixed to the roof. The compact living space includes bunks attached to the walls six feet above the floor. Ten miles from Freedom 19 rests Base Gagarin, the Russian moonbase situated at the bottom of a fold in the moon's surface. The Americans travel to and from Base Gagarin in a small land car for supply runs and meetings. Compared to the cozy quarters of the American base, the Russian base is large and comfortable with three domes instead of one. The main dome has more than three thousand square feet and the smaller two are twelve hundred square feet each. Finogenev's office is one-hundred square feet with a wooden desk and chair. Major Winship envies the comfort in which the Russians live on their base and mentions the presence of a samovar, which they use to boil and dispense hot tea. Winship also believes the Russians chose their heavy, wooden furniture to taunt the Americans since they have access to vast amounts of aluminum and choose wood construction instead. "

        "Summary_1": "After the Russians conduct their seismic test, a moonquake erupts and tears a leak in the American dome. This leak is significant because it is the first of a series of slightly cataclysmic events. As well, it highlights the strained and tense relationship between the Russians and the Americans. \nMajor Winship accused the Russians of deliberately injuring their base, further showing how contentious their relationship is. General Finogenov ardently denies this, however, and says that their base had no damage at all. \nAfter trying and failing to fix the leak with their own supplies, two of the Americans are forced to travel to Base Gagarin and borrow their resin. This ends up backfiring, however, as the epoxy quickly heats up and explodes as they mix the two components together. The explosion further damages the dome and takes away the American\u2019s entire air supply. \nAs well, the seismic testing was greatly discouraged and protested by the Americans. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The four man American crew on the moon is warned about the Soviets\u2019 underground atomic device and its planned detonation before the test is completed. The Soviets have planned the explosion in order to learn more about the composition of the moon. The shock waves from the explosion should give them information about the various layers of the moon. The Americans protested the underground explosion because they feared that the device\u2019s detonation would disturb their satellite. Although the Americans call their Soviet counterparts to get information about the exact timing of the explosion, the person who answers the phone cannot speak English, so they are unable to learn the Soviets\u2019 specific plans. Major Winship is outside of the American dome when the device is detonated, which is strictly against protocol. The Americans prove that they were right to fight the Soviets about their plan because the dome they live in gets a leak from the shifting surface of the moon. The Soviet General apologizes for the lack of communication and the damage to the Americans\u2019 dome, but their behavior still reads as suspicious. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Soviet Union had conducted a seismic test on the moon by detonating an underground atomic device, but the Americans had warned the Soviets that they shouldn't go through with the tests because of potential dangers. Even though the Americans asked the Soviets not to run the test, they did anyway, and the resulting tremors ruptured the American dome. Not only was the dome leaking air because of this test, but the Americans had to rely on the Soviets for supplies to try to fix it. This only made matters worse, because the materials the Americans borrowed from the Soviets to repair the dome ended up burning out their entire oxygen supply, leaving them stranded without air at the end of the story. In this way, the seismic test shows both the power the Soviets think they hold over the Americans as well as a chance for the Americans to lose emergency supplies as their situation rapidly falls downhill.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The Russians claim to conduct the seismic test in order to analyze the resultant shock waves to help them better understand the composition of the moon where they and the American have established bases. Although they insist their purpose is purely scientific, Major Winship suspects they intended the test to harm Freedom 19. The test triggers a few moonquakes, which ultimately causes a leak to appear in the dome. The resulting loss in air pressure leads the crew of the Freedom 19 to attempt a variety of methods to patch the leak. However, they have subpar materials and tools to work with compared with the plentiful resource at Base Gagarin. Lawler and Chandler make their way to the Russian base in order to procure calking that may seal the leak. They return with the calking compound which turns out to be a highly combustible material, which explodes and eliminates the rest of their air supply."

Wilkins volunteered wearily.\n  \n \n  It was an awkward operation that took several minutes. Capt. Wilkins\ncursed twice during the operation. \"I'd hate to live in this thing for\nany period.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think these suits are one thing we've got over the Russians,\" Major\nWinship said. \"I don't see how they can manipulate those bulky pieces\nof junk around.\"\n  \n \n  They ate.\n  \n \n  \"Really horrible stuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nutritious.\"\n  \n \n  After the meal, Major Winship said reflectively, \"Now I'd like a cup of\nhot tea. I'm cooled off.\"\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins raised eyebrows. \"What brought this on?\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just thinking.... They really got it made, Larry.

That's living.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been here six years longer, after all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Finogenov had a\n   \n   clay\n   \n  samovar sent up. Lemon and nutmeg, too.

Fifty pounds more or less\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They've got the power-plants for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you think he did that deliberately?\" Major Winship asked. \"I think\nhe's trying to force us off. I think he hoped for the quake. Gagarin's\nbuilt to take it, I'll say that. Looks like it, anyhow. You don't\nsuppose they planned this all along? Even if they didn't, they sure got\nthe jump on us again, didn't they? I told you what he told me?\"\n  \n \n  \"You told me,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n  \n<doc-sep>Comprehension dawned. Capt. Wilkins nodded and started to turn away.\nMajor Winship caught his arm and nodded his head toward the loose jack.\n  \n \n  Oh.\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins nodded and smiled. He reached across and plugged the\nspeaker in again.\n  \n \n  \"... Freedom 19! Hello, Freedom 19! Come in!\"\n  \n \n  \"We're here,\" Major Winship said.\n  \n \n  \"All right? Are you all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're all right. A-Okay.\" Major Winship, mindful of the extent of his\npotential audience, took a deep breath. \"Earlier this morning, the\nSoviet Union fired an underground atomic device for the\n   \n   ostensible\n   \n  purpose of investigating the composition of the lunar mass by means of\nseismic analysis of the resultant shock waves. This was done in spite\nof American warnings that such a disturbance might release accumulated\nstresses in the long undisturbed satellite, and was done in the face of\nvigorous American protests.\"\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins tapped his helmet and gestured for him to swivel around.\nThe turn was uncomfortably tight and complicated by the restraining\ncables. Capt. Wilkins began replacement of the air bottle.\n  \n \n  \"These protests have proved well founded,\" Major Winship continued.\n\"Immediately following the detonation, Freedom 19 was called on to\nwithstand a moderately severe shifting of the Lunar surface. No\npersonnel were injured and there was no equipment damage.\"\n  \n \n  Capt. Wilkins tapped his shoulder to indicate the new air bottle was\nbeing inserted. Another tap indicated it was seated. Major Winship\nflicked the appropriate chest button and nodded in appreciation.\n  \n \n  \"However,\" he continued, \"we did experience a minor leak in the dome,\nwhich is presently being repaired.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Soviet Union,\" came the reply, \"has reported the disturbance and\nhas tendered their official apology. You want it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can wait until later. Send it by mail for all I care. Vacuum has\ndestroyed our organic air reconditioner. We have approximately three\nweeks of emergency air. However, Base Gagarin reports no damage, so\nthat, in the event we exhaust our air, we will be able to obtain the\nnecessary replacement.\"\n  \n \n  The wait of a little better than three seconds for the response gave\nthe conversation a tone of deliberation.\n  \n \n  A new voice came on. \"We tried to contact you earlier, Major. We will\nbe able to deliver replacements in about ten days.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will forward a coded report on the occurrence,\" Major Winship said.\n  \n \n  \"Let us hear from you again in ... about three hours. Is the leak\nrepaired?\"\n  \n \n  \"The leak has not yet been repaired. Over and out.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded to Capt. Wilkins and leaned back.\n  \n \n  Methodically, Capt. Wilkins set about disconnecting the major from the\ntransmitter.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Major Winship when he was once more in communication. \"For\na moment there, I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Capt. Wilkins asked with interest.\n  \n \n  \"I could see myself asking them to ask the Russians to ask Finogenov\nto get on the emergency channel to ask you to charge the air bottle.\nI never felt so ... idiotic is not quite strong enough ... there for a\nminute in my whole life. I didn't know how much emergency air was left,\nand I thought, my God, I'll never live this down. All the hams in the\nworld listening, while I try to explain the situation. I could see the\nnickname being entered in my files: aka. The Airless Idiot. I tell you,\nthat was rough.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler returned with the calking compound. It\noccupied the rear section of the land car. Lt. Chandler sat atop it. It\nwas a fifty-five gallon drum.\n  \n \n  The airlock to Freedom 19 was open. \"What is\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\" asked Major\nWinship, squinting out into the glaring sunlight.\n  \n \n  \"That,\" said Capt. Lawler, \"is the calking compound.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're kidding,\" said Capt. Wilkins.\n  \n \n  \"I am not kidding.\"\n  \n \n  Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler came inside. Capt. Wilkins mounted a bunk.\n  \n \n  \"Why didn't you just borrow a cupful?\" Major Winship said sarcastically.\n  \n \n  \"It's this way,\" Lt. Chandler said. \"They didn't have anything but\n55-gallon drums of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, my,\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"I suppose it's a steel drum. Those\nthings must weigh....\"\n  \n \n  \"Actually, I think you guys have got the general wrong,\" Capt. Lawler\nsaid. \"He was out, himself, to greet us. I think he was really quite\nupset by the quake. Probably because his people had misfigured so bad.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's too damned suspicious,\" Major Winship said. \"You know and I know\nwhy they set that blast off. I tried to tell him. Hell. He looks at me\nlike an emasculated owl and wants to know our ulterior motive in trying\nto prevent a purely scientific experiment, the results of which will be\npublished in the technical press for the good of everybody. I'll bet!\"\n  \n \n  \"About this drum,\" Capt. Wilkins said.\n  \n \n  \"Well, like I said, it's this way,\" Lt. Chandler resumed. \"I told him\nwe needed about a pint. Maybe a quart. But this stuff you have to mix\nup. He only had these drums. There's two parts to it, and you have to\ncombine them in just the right proportion. He told me to take a little\nscale\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"A little scale?\" asked Capt. Wilkins, rolling his eyes at the dome.\n  \n \n  \"That's what I told him. We don't have any little scale.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Captain Lawler, \"and he looked at us with that mute,\nsurprised look, like everybody, everywhere has dozens of little\nscales.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, anyway,\" Lt. Chandler continued, \"he told us just to mix up the\nwhole fifty-five gallon drum. There's a little bucket of stuff that\ngoes in, and it's measured just right. We can throw away what we don't\nneed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Somehow, that sounds like him,\" Major Winship said.\n  \n \n  \"He had five or six of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Jesus!\" said Capt. Wilkins. \"That must be\n   \n   three thousand pounds\n   \n  of\ncalking compound. Those people are insane.\"\n  \n \n  \"The question is,\" Capt. Lawler said, \"'How are we going to mix it?'\nIt's supposed to be mixed thoroughly.\"\n  \n \n  They thought over the problem for a while.\n  \n \n  \"That will be a man-sized job,\" Major Winship said.\n  \n \n  \"Let's see, Charlie.

        "Summary_1": "Major Winship is one of the few Americans who is currently living on base on the surface of the moon. He is in charge as the Commanding Officer of Freedom 19, as he outranks both the Captains and the first Lieutenant. After watching the moonquake shake the surface from inside the base, Major Winship quickly realizes that the quake ripped a hole in the dome itself. He attempts to fix it with a marker, then with a plastic sheet, but both fail. Their caulking compound has hardened and is completely unusable. Winship accuses the Russians of causing the quake and leak on purpose, but the General vehemently denies his claims. They try to call into Earth but realize that without air, there\u2019d be no sound. So, they have to find another way.  \nStuck in his suit until they can restore air to the base, Winship sends Lt. Chandler and Capt. Lawler to ask the Soviets for help. Winship shares a meal with Wilkins, and then the Captain connected to Winship with a series of wires to the radio. This way he\u2019d be able to communicate while in his suit. \nHe suffers a major mistake with the wiring, however, when his air supply is cut off. He motions to Wilkins who saves him, reconnecting the lost cable, and Winship lets those on Earth know what happened. They let him know that they\u2019ve received a formal apology and that they will send a replacement in ten days\u2019 time. \nOnce Chandler and Lawler return, Winship is faced with a new problem: how to mix and activate the 55-gallon fix for the leak. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, and they bring the barrel inside to mix. The barrel becomes red-hot and looks to be on the verge of combustion. The men scramble and get to the airlock. The barrel explodes and the flames use up all the oxygen. Winship is faced with an even greater problem now: how to survive. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Major Winship is the main character in \u201cThe Winning of the Moon\u201d, and he faces external and internal conflicts throughout the story. At the beginning of the story, Winship\u2019s spacesuit malfunctions, and the technology that keeps him cool stops working. He begins sweating profusely, and it deeply annoys him. He wants information about the Soviets\u2019 planned explosion, but he cannot learn the timing of the explosion because the person he speaks to at the Soviet base does not speak English. This further frustrates Winship, and he begins to believe that the Soviets are making the Americans\u2019 lives difficult on purpose. He decides to take a risk and exit the dome even though he can\u2019t be totally sure that the device was already detonated. He goes outside to cool himself off, and within moments he feels the ground quaking. When he discovers a leak in the dome, he tries unsuccessfully to patch it up with plastic sheeting. The last thing he wants to do is ask the Soviets for help, so he becomes even more irritated when he learns that the calk the Americans have on hand is busted and will not work to fix the leak.Two of his team members head to the Soviet base to get supplies to fix the leak, but Winship stays behind with his malfunctioning suit. He decides to call Earth to discuss the Soviets\u2019 actions, and while he is on the phone, he realizes that he is using his emergency air supply. He has to motion silently to his colleague, Wilkins, to help him out so that he can breathe. Winship is very frustrated when Lawler and Chandler return to the American base with a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix the small leak, and he once again questions the Soviets\u2019 actions. He has to quickly exit the dome along with the other crew members before the drum explodes after they attempt to ready the concoction for use with an electric mixer. ",
        "Summary_3": "Major Winship is the commanding officer of the mission Freedom 19, the American base on the moon. He runs communications with the Russians who are also on the moon, and is trying to requet information from Pinov, who does not speak English, at the beginning of the story. He is upset with the Russians and does not like them very much, and he thinks they are deliberately making communication difficult. His reefer isn't working and he's boiling in his suit so he insists on going back into the dome to cool off, when he is knocked over by the quake from a seismic test the Russians are doing. He has a spat on the radio with the Russians and complains about the situation as the Americans try to patch the dome. While Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler head to the base for supplies, he stays behind in the dome, reflecting on how the American space suits are better than those of the Russians, as he yearns to be able to smoke. After the men return with a drum of calking compound, Winship continues discussing his suspicions that the Soviets ran the test to cause damage to the American base on purpose. After they try to mix the drum indoors, he realizes they have to move it back outside, but soon everything goes wrong. The drum heats up, heating up the air tank in turn, and a flame shoots through the dome, burning through the entire American oxygen supply.",
        "Summary_4": "Major Winship is the commander of the four-person crew of the Freedom 19. Suspicious and cynical, Winship envies the luxury in which the crew at Base Gagarin lives. His bitterness manifests in his interactions with everyone from the Russian crew; he grows frustrated and impatient when Pinov cannot speak English. He suspects General Finogenov is lying about the purpose of the atomic test and believes he wants to eliminate the American base from the moon entirely. Winship orders his crew through a series of failed repairs using their inferior resources after the atomic test results in an air leak in the Freedom 19 dome. During his call to Earth to report the explosion damage, he thinks he is dying when his emergency air supply runs out, but Wilkins quickly replaces it. Winship's growing frustration reaches its crescendo when Lawler and Chandler return from their supply run, and the five-person crew struggles to maneuver the large container into the small dome and then further struggle to build a makeshift mixer which with to stir the calking compound.

        "Summary_1": "Mia is taught that those who destroyed Earth were not smart and that they deserve punishment for their actions. According to her, Earth was evacuated because of overpopulation. People had too many children that required more resources than Earth was capable of providing. Consequently, there was a fight over the remaining resources that caused a war. \n\nMia has great-great-grandparents that were among those who anticipated the destruction of Earth and prepared to leave. \n\nIn addition, Mia talks about how humans left Earth. She says there were Great Ships built around 2025. The Great Ships and other things went into the Solar System in 2041. The humans that escaped established 112 colonies in the first 16 years. During this retelling of what she was taught, she emphasizes that horses were important to the success of the new colonies. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Mia knows that there was a evac plan on Earth long ago, the evac plan needed to be implemented and colonies had to be established in a very short amount of time. In 2025, first of the eight Great Ships was finished. Then before 2041, 112 colonies were created. Mia believes that bringing horses to the colonies was an important factor that lead to the success of those colonies. Even those few planets could have had substitutes for horses, they had to be domesticated and trained. \n\nLater we acknowledge that Mia has learned about the Free Birthers in school. They destroyed Earth. Those Free Birthers basically just bred and spread, and the population on earth reached 8 billion. With so many people, resources became limited, which in the end lead to the war that destroyed Earth, and 8 billion people died along with the blow up of the Solar System. Thus, without those Free Birthers, there would never be 8 billion people on Earth, then the evac plan would never take place, and those 8 billion people would not have to die. If his great-great-grandparents did not have the foresight he did, Mia might not even be alive. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mia is taught that, ultimately, Earth\u2019s destruction is attributable to Free Birthers, those who have an unregulated number of children. Because of the resulting overpopulation, the resources of Earth were consumed and contested, resulting in the death of eight billion people and the final war which tore apart the solar system in 2041. The first of the Great Ships, like the one on which Mia lives, was built sixteen years prior, and, in the intervening years, 112 colonies had been established. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Mia was taught, along with all young students, that Earth was destroyed due to an overpopulation problem. \"Free Birthers\" are to blame for the destruction of Earth; these are people that had multiple children, and according to what Mia was taught, used up all the limited resources that Earth had. By a certain point, Earth had become too overcrowded, with over eight billion people as a population. This ultimately led to a final war, and an evacuation."

        "Summary_1": "Mia discusses how she does not like different planets for many reasons, gravity included. In addition, she does not like the idea of animals that can crawl on her or vegetation existing unintentionally. She also does not like the smells of different planets. When Mia sees individuals with more than one child, she becomes nauseous at the sight. To Mia, that seems reckless to have so many children as she is taught that it was the cause of Earth\u2019s destruction. Another occurrence that Mia finds interesting is when she sees an old man during her travels. She is fascinated by his white hair, which she notes that she had never seen in person before. ",
        "Summary_2": "Firstly, the planet Tintera has not been in contact with the Ship for almost 150 years. For the first two days in her Trial she sees nothing except some odd looking animals. To her surprise, they actually taste good, while some other good looking things do not taste so good. She also notices the ugly animals that Horst and his men are herding. Secondly, the town shocks her. Everything there are out of date. The truck she saw is the most advanced machine they have. The newspaper at the rear of the town has \u201cinvasion\u201d printed on them. There are literally no women older than 10 years old, only men, boys and kids. She feels weird. But after she sees the swarming kids, she realizes that those people are Free Birthers. She feels sick by what she sees in this sight since they are the ones that basically destroyed Earth. Moreover, to her surprises, they don\u2019t even seem to remember about the things that they\u2019ve done to Earth at all. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mia harbors a dislike for planets, particularly because she is unaccustomed to certain aspects. Specifically, she feels the attractive force gravity is different from on the ship where she lives. She is unfamiliar with the ubiquitous vegetation and the fauna. Furthermore, Mia mentions that she is not used to having the lights go out, suggesting that the lights on the ship stay on at all times. Most of all, however, she dislikes the smell of planets. Though there is a relatively small space on her ship on the third level which bear semblance to planets, it is different from Tintera in that Mia is able to leave when she feels uncomfortable. \n\tAdditionally, Tintera\u2019s human culture is different from on the ship. Whereas the inhabitants of the ship are bound by a culture which prohibits unregulated reproduction, the people of Tintera are Free Birthers unconcerned with such matters. When Mia discovers this, she feels nauseated and disgusted at their behaviour. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Tintera has many differences from the life on the ship that Mia is used to. Firstly, and as is similar for all planets, it has an unpleasant smell in its atmosphere. The seasons are also different; despite it being December on the ship, it is spring on Tintera. The planet also has animals that Mia is not used to seeing; for example, the strange creatures that she sees being herded by the men on horseback. The biggest difference that Mia notes about Tintera is that here, people have multiple children who roam about freely. This goes against the rules of the Council and frightens Mia. "

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "At fourteen years old, the inhabitants of the Ship are put through a Trial. During the trial, they are dropped off at the nearest colonized planet and then picked up a month later if they manage to survive on the planet. Each of the fourteen-year-olds are dropped off in separate locations on the planet. They are given a pick signal device so the scoutship that escorted them to the planet is able to locate them at the end of their 30-day Trial period. \n\nThe purpose of the trial according to the Chairman of the Council is because a closed society needs a way to ensure the physical and mental of its populations. In addition, it helps to maintain a suitable number of individuals in the population. Those that are unable to survive their Trial are presumed to be not fit for life on the Ship.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "At the age of fourteen, each of the inhabitants of the Ship are supposed to have their Trial. Simply stated, they will be dropped at a colonized planet that is the nearest to them for a month, and for this whole thirty days, the inhabitants will try to keep themselves alive. They can do this on their own, with partners, or join forces. Each of the inhabitants is provided with a sonic pistol, pickup signal, saddle, cinches, food and clothes. One month later, the Ship will come back to get them according to their pickup signal. It is important to note that, while they have all been prepared and trained to survive, some of them are still not able to make it out alive. According to the society, they are incapable of presenting themselves as useful to the Ship if they cannot make it out alive. Mia understands that this whole process is for the good of the society. And since they have all been through this training, everyone on the Ship \u2013 the society \u2013 are able to take care of themselves if they ever have to do so. Moreover, this process prevents the society from decaying, both in the mind and in the body as well as to keep a steady population. ",
        "Summary_3": "At fourteen, the inhabitants of the Ship undergo their Trial, a month-long period in which they must survive on the nearest inhabited planet by themselves. Though Mia Havero, the first-person narrator of the story, expects to return safely to the ship after the duration of her Trial, many do not survive. For her trial, Mia is left on the planet Tintera with her horse, Ninc, food and clothes, and a pickup signal.\n\tThe rationale behind the trial, as Mia presents it, is to screen for those inhabitants of the ship able to take care of themselves. Those who are unable to look after themselves and thereby fail the trial are not sufficiently prepared for life on the Ship. Additionally, Mia\u2019s father, the chairman of the council of the ship, tells her that it is to prevent its population from decaying mentally and physically, as well as to maintain the population. \n",
        "Summary_4": "When children on the ship turn fourteen, they are dropped on a planet that has been colonized. They are left alone for a month to fend for themselves and survive, then are picked up again by the ship. The children are prepared beforehand, and trained in survival and fighting in order to stand a chance at the Trial. However, not everyone makes it. The Ship's reasoning behind this is to ensure that every individual is able to take care of themselves and be properly skilled. Mia's father has also suggested other motives, including maintaining a steady population and keeping it from decreasing its value mentally and physically."

But as she is about to stay at a campsite for the night, she heard Horst and his group of men\u2019s voice. She tries to run, but gets caught by one of Horst\u2019s man. She tries to scream for help, but before she could do so, her mouth gets covered by Horst. Mia still has the gun with her, so she threatens Horst to hand her the pickup signal since this is her only way of getting contact with the Ship when they are to be brought back. After he handed it to her, she asks for the name of the kid in jail. But before she could get an answer, she gets hit and lost her gun. Horst has the pickup signal now. He smashes it until it fells apart. Then after calling him a \u201cbig louse\u201d she is knocked out. ",
        "Summary_3": "Horst is a man whom Mia meets on her third day on Tintera. He wields a gun which he keeps in his saddle boots, and is roughly the age of Mia\u2019s father. Mia describes his face as mean-looking, from which she surmises that he is mean. He and his team of four others are tasked with herding a group of ugly green creatures with squat figures and lanky limbs. \nOn his first encounter with Mia, he mistakes her for a boy and encourages her to join his team on the ride to Forton. However, when she refuses, he reaches for his gun before Mia quickly unholsters her weapon and aims it at him. She holds him and his team at gunpoint, forcing them to disarm, and makes them ride with her for twenty minutes before letting them go. \nLater, Mia is at a camp when she notices the arrival of Horst and his team. One of them recognizes her and signals Horst over. As she fights with this other man, Horst subdues her and threatens to harm her. As the other man beats Mia, Horst intervenes and tells him to stop, asserting his leadership of the group. Mia threatens to report Horst to the courts, which causes him to laugh and point out that she is obviously not from Tintera. As Horst is distracted with one of the other men, Mia pulls her gun on him and asks him a question. As he stalls, another man strikes her, and Horst quickly renders her unconscious. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Horst is one of the riders that Mia encounters at her arrival on Tintera. He is a middle-aged man with a mean and threatening demeanor. Horst has violent intentions with Mia; he initially offers to take her along with the team of men for protection, but upon Mia's refusal, threatens her with his rifle. Mia is able to intimidate him with her own weapons, but later that night the men return by the campfire, where Mia is attacked by Horst and robbed. Mia initially only dislikes Horst, because of his mean aura and the fact that he refers to her as a boy; however, as Horst's violence is demonstrated more throughout the story, she becomes fearful of him, though still determined to stand up to him."

        "Summary_1": "The story starts with four of the species of the spectrum of human development together, talking and explaining about the possibility of mating with different species on the spectrum to Taphetta the Ribboneer. Emmer is an archeologist and he sits on one end of the spectrum. Halden, the biologist is from Earth, he is somewhat towards the middle on the spectrum. Meredith is a linguist, and she is further down the spectrum. And Kelburn, the mathematician, is at the far end of it. They explain to Taphetta about the theory of ability to mate with humans that are on planets that are close to each other. However, due to movement of planets, they are no longer close to each other. But with some accurate calculations, if all the stars were to go back two hundred thousand years, the position of those stars line up in the shape of a horse shoe. And they theorize that their original home lands on where the extension of the two ends of the horse shoe cross over. And the four explorers believe they have a chance of finding their original home. They are explaining this to Taphetta because they need him to be the pilot of this expedition. \n\nAfter Taphetta suggests that he does not like the air in the ship, they realize that some animals hs been eating the plants. With failing attempts to capture them, the biologist suggest that their mental and physical state might have changed due to radiation or atomic engines. Thus they set up a play for the animal to watch so that they will get into the trap. \n\nMeredith and Halden get into a fight because Meredith thinks Halden as primitive, and Halden does not like that. When he realizes that Meredith somehow knows she can\u2019t be fertile with Kelburn, he gets so angry that he hits her nose. Then he come to realize why Meredith will not want to marry him and have children with him, even he would want superior children.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Taphetta discussing with Sam Halden, the leader of the expedition, Sam\u2019s theory on the origins of humans. They talk about different species and their abilities to mate with other species depending on how closely related the species are physical. They attempt to persuade Taphetta to pilot the ship by arguing that their theory is sound in logic and could lead to a great discovery. Taphetta is skeptical of their assertions for the origins of humans. Kelburn continues to explain in an attempt to convince him to navigate their ship.\n\nEventually, Taphetta agrees to navigate their ship as long as they sign his contract. The group does sign his contract as they desperately need his skills to complete their expedition. Halden trusts that his contract will not be deceitful. Once he has agreed, the group discusses Taphetta\u2019s need for better oxygen on the ship. During this discussion, it is brought to Halden\u2019s attention that there is an unknown pest on board the ship, an animal. \n\nEmmer talks to Taphetta about how every human race has achieved space travel at some point in their existence. Taphetta questions what they hope to achieve from their expedition, assuming that there will be money and technology to gain from the mission. Emmer and Halden argue that the examination of their culture and the drive of curiosity are their motivations for the mission. \n\nAt some point, the animals on the ship engage in a fight with a knife. After, Meredith and Halden begin conversing about their potential relationship. Halden leads Meredith to his cabin where he instinctively punches her nose after she has made him upset. They exchange words of admiration and lust for each other. Halden primitively kisses Meredith with passion.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Sam Halden, a biologist from a world where humans have developed to the early-middle section of their evolution, is in conversation with Taphetta, an individual of the non-human species Ribboneers, so named because of the ribbons protruding from his head. Halden explains to Taphetta that there are hundreds of independently-evolved human species on just as many worlds, each at various stages of human development. The crew of Halden\u2019s expedition, humans from the various human-inhabited worlds, represents the range of human development: Emmer is a Neanderthal-type archeologist who represents early humanity, Halden is an early-middle human, Meredith is a linguist from an advanced-middle human society, and Kelburn is a mathematician from the far advanced side of human evolution. \nTaphetta, himself from an advanced civilization, is initially uninterested in Halden\u2019s theories of human evolution. However, as Kelburn elaborates on the adjacency mating principle, an observation supporting the humans\u2019 hypothesis of a common ancestor which distributed humans throughout the galaxy, he becomes interested. Taphetta accepts the humans\u2019 invitation to be their pilot for the expedition, on the condition that they use his contract. \n\tAn engineer from the ship\u2019s hydroponics department, which is responsible for regulation of the ship\u2019s air, reports to Meredith, who is physically attractive and wearing a revealing skirt, that Taphetta is not fond of the air. Halden learns that the air quality in the ship has been suffering due to damage to the plants caused by an animal. Despite the engineer\u2019s efforts, the animal is resistant to pesticides and is intelligent enough to avoid the electric traps. They resolve to bait it into a trap. \n\tHalden approaches the ribboneer to inform him of the infestation. As he considers using the bait, Taphetta asks Emmer about the archeological evidence of their common ancestor on his home planet. The Neanderthal reveals that relics of massive proportions indicate the size of the common ancestor, and that they were likely long-lived and able to travel faster than light. Halden hypothesizes that their ancestor was unable to find a suitable planet, so instead left modified versions of themselves on each planet they visited. Taphetta is further interested by the theory of the common ancestry and finally acquiesces to using a bait to trap the pest. He also reveals that the terms of the contract upon which he insisted prohibits that information discovered during the expedition be withheld to the benefit of any race. \n\tMeredith and Halden are now monitoring the hydroponics room. They control two pest-like puppets which enact a fight scene: the smaller puppet, initially defeated by the larger, finds a knife and is able to slay the larger. The humans hope that the pests will be lured to the knife. Meredith and Halden then retire to his cabin, where she discusses the possible father of her children. Though she loves him, she dismisses the idea of bearing his child, as it will dilute her evolved biology. He strikes her and breaks her nose, but she quickly heals. He kisses her. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Taphetta, a creature of the Ribboneer species, has recently been recruited by a team of humans to aid in navigating a mission to discover the human race's \"big ancestor\": the original source of all humans which are now scattered across the Milky Way. Curious, and slightly skeptical, of the mission, Taphetta interrogates Sam Halden, a biologist, and Kelburn, a mathematician, about their theory of how humans evolved. Through analyzing the galactic routes of the human race and their locations throughout history, the team believes they have pinned the general home of the big ancestor. Taphetta agrees to help in the mission, under the condition that the team agrees to his own proposed contract rather than their own. As Taphetta prepares for navigation, he notes to Firmon, head of hydroponics, that he is bothered by the air quality on the ship. Firmon attempts to improve the air, however is met with an issue; the plants on the ship are being eaten by an unknown animal that hides within its machinery. With options limited to rebuilding the ship or baiting the animals through a risky experiment, Taphetta is again skeptical of the conditions of the ship. He requests that the team answer more questions while he thinks it over, and inquires about the big ancestor and its qualities. Emmer, a Neanderthal archaeologist, recounts his experiences growing up around the ruins of the ancestors; the infrastructure was all that they left behind, with no other scrap of information that would indicate their existence, though it is likely that they left in search of another planet to live on while improving themselves through the alteration of their germ plasm. Taphetta then questions the motives of the mission, to which Emmer and Halden consider the abilities of the big ancestor, and how much of an achievement it would be to gain the knowledge they possessed biologically. Holden asks Taphetta what the difference was between the contract the team proposed and his own; he responds and says that his contract ensured the discoveries made on this mission would not be withheld for humans exclusively. With Taphetta agreeing to baiting the animals, the team uses a realistic puppet that resembles the pests, with a retractable knife that is able to kill them when they get close. After a successful test run, Halden and linguist Meredith, who have an intimate relationship to each other, go back to Halden's cabin, where they discuss the future, including having children. Meredith, who is of a higher race than Halden, admits that her main concern is bearing children that are as superior as possible, which requires a partner of a higher race than her. This angers Halden, resulting in him striking her, yet they both love each other and their passion overweighs their tension."

        "Summary_1": "Taphetta the Ribboneer was on another ship that was passing by the expedition ship.

Prior to the start of the story, the pilot of the humans\u2019 ship falls ill. They hail a ship passing by, partly in an attempt to find a new pilot. Taphetta was on that ship, and the story begins with a conversation between him and the human biologist, Sam Halden. \n\tHalden describes to Taphetta the theory behind the expedition on which the human ship has embarked, concerning an ancestor common to the many planets of humans in the Milky Way galaxy. Though initially uninterested, Taphetta is confronted with evidence for the humans\u2019 theory, and later admits that they make a compelling argument. Taphetta arees to join the crew of the expedition, on the condition that he be hired under an extensive micro-printed contract which stipulates that no discovery in which he takes part should be hidden to the benefit of any race. \nOn the ship, Taphetta suffers from the air quality. Ribboneers breathe through tubes scattered throughout their bodies. Halden discovers that the problem is animals interfering with the growth of plants in the hydroponics sector of the ship, which are responsible for air quality regulation. Halden proposes using bait to trap the pests, to which Taphetta says he needs to think on the issue. As he thinks, Taphetta enquires further about the evidence supporting the humans\u2019 theory, asking about the significance of discovering an answer, and the unequal development of humans across various planets. Aftering demonstrating interest in the answers given by his interlocutor Emmer, an archeologist, he acquiesces to use of bait to deal with the pest problem.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Taphetta is a non-human, of the Ribboneer species. His appearance resembles his name; he has flat limbs and a knotted thin body. Taphetta is also an experienced pilot, as his species specializes in navigation. Taphetta is recruited by the humans to guide their ship for their mission in finding their original ancestor, as their initial pilot became ill. Taphetta is a wary and dubious creature, so he asks several questions before agreeing to help. He also requires that the team agree to his own terms and contract, which demand transparency in their findings and condemn the withholding of information. Taphetta settles into the ship, but is uncomfortable with the cleanliness of the air; the team recognizes how crucial Taphetta's compliance is to their mission and stages an experiment to catch pests that are damaging the ship's plants. Taphetta uses this as another opportunity to ask questions and gauge more information on the mission."

She had something else in mind.\n  \n \n  \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\nhave subhuman monsters.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\nIt had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\nsurface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn?

Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n  \n \n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species.

        "Summary_1": "Meredith is a linguist who sits on the middle towards end of the spectrum; Halden is a biologist that is on the middle towards beginning of the spectrum. Meredith is wearing a short skirt which gets Firmon\u2019s unwanted attention. She is also aware of the fact that she has been called \u201cmistress\u201d by the ship crews. \n\nAfter setting the trap for the plant eating animals, Meredith complements Halden for his primitiveness and calls their love barbaric, but Halden takes it a different way. He is indeed primitive in comparison to Meredith, but he clearly does not like the sound of it. He is of the lower level, she is a step up for him. In strong constrast to Taphetta\u2019s belief of all humans are the same disregarding where they are on the spectrum, Meredith thinks that this spectrum weights more than the amount of love between Meredith and Halden. They seem to have known this all along. Halden never asks Meredith if she wanted to marry him, nor will Meredith say yes to that. Halden doesn\u2019t like to be thought of the lower level human, but to his surprise, Halden later realizes that he also prefers a higher level children. ",
        "Summary_2": "Sam Halden is a biologist from Earth and Meredith is a linguist from a place located on the other side of the middle. They are from two different points on the biological spectrum of human development. Meredith is on a higher point of the scale. They have the potential to be able to successfully produce a child from mating. Halden is from a more primitive version of humans. \n\nPeople have rumored that Meredith is Halden\u2019s mistress. There is a conflict between them as a potential relationship would cause Meredith to be reproducing with a race lesser than her race. She admits that she is in love and is physically attracted to Halden, but she does not want that to convince her to be in a relationship with him. They have tension in the story that creates a fight where Halden instinctively punches Meredith in the nose. Halden recognizes that Meredith is cruel to him and perhaps using him, yet he too loves her. He is tortured by the thought that he is as manipulative as Meredith because he is attracted to the idea of marrying a woman of a higher race as it would reflect him achieving a high goal. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Meredith and Halden are both human crewmembers on an expedition with the intention of exploring the humans\u2019 common ancestor. Though they are of the same species, they are from different planets on each of which humans have evolved independently and at different rates. Halden, a biologist, is on the early-middle side of the evolutionary scale. Meredith, a linguist, though more closely related to Halden than to any of her other crewmates, is from the later-middle side of the evolutionary scale. Despite Meredith\u2019s refusal to bear children with halden, they are of similar enough evolutionary stages that they are compatible. \nAs Meredith and Halden watch the simulated fight between the puppet pests, she comments on Halden\u2019s primitive strategizing, and fetishizes this aspect of Halden. Halden briefly recalls the previous times when she did the same, before they return to his cabin. Halden reflects on Meredith\u2019s physical attractiveness, but concludes that her facial features are plain. She reiterates her desire against bearing children with him, for they would be of a lower evolutionary status than she is. Halden comments that, if she were searching for a mate who would yield offspring of the higher type, then Kelburn, a far-advanced human, would be the best choice. However, Meredith implies that she and Kelburn have previously attempted to mate, but are incompatible with one another. She nuzzles Halden, before he instinctively hits her. She quickly heals her nose, and tells him that she loves him, but will not bear his children if they marry. He kisses her. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Meredith and Halden have a passionate but high-strung relationship. They are both of the general human race; however, Halden is of an inferior species on Earth, while Meredith is slightly more advanced, of the Terran race. Halden and Meredith are in love, but face several complications: their relationship is mainly, at its surface level, physical, as Halden and the team refer to Meredith as his \"mistress\". Additionally, Meredith is preoccupied with the idea of bearing children that are biologically superior; she believes that having children with Halden would be a setback and against her morals. For these reasons, Meredith plans to explore bearing children with humans from other races, which enrages Halden. The tension between them is detrimental to their relationship, as Halden expresses it through violence. However, their love and passion for each other keeps them together in an imperfect situation. "

It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a\nhundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a\nfew of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was\nactually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists\nstretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n  \n \n  \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the\nStone Age aren't related to anything else there.

Man was the most numerous\nthough not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization as\nhigh as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were\nothers\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got\ntogether\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n  \n \n  Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\nvery useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\nhelping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating\nprinciple?\" asked Sam Halden.\n  \n \n  \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\nthat humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\nWe've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence.

When we project back into time those star\nsystems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\npattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n  \n \n  The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color\nchange was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he\nwas interested.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The goal of the expedition is to find their original home. There are many different species on the human development spectrum, and it is assumed that they can only mate with the species that are close to them on the spectrum according to the adjacency mating principle. Following this principle, careful calculations are done on the orbits of those planets. By determining their location in space at different times, the team are able to find a specific time in the whole universe that not only makes the specific pattern of a horse shoe, but also has supporting data backed up this hypothesis. Furthermore, if two imaginary lines extend from the ends of the horse shoe, the two lines will eventually meet and cross over at a specific location in space. The team are able to narrow the crossing point down to a few cubic light-years. According to the team, this space should be the place that their original home is. If they are to find the planet that the hypothetical unknown ancestors belongs to, they will be making cultural discoveries, technological advances, and finding out where they actually come from. ",
        "Summary_2": "The mission of the expedition is to find the origins of the human race. Taphetta refers to this as the big ancestor. The theory is that the human race did not originate on any planets that it currently inhabits. They believe that humans evolved at a different location and then began to settle across a particular section of the Milk Way. Their evidence to support this theory is that there are worlds where humans have been before the Stone Age and are not related to anything in that world. \n\nAnother supporting theory they present is the adjacency mating principle. The principle outlines which humans can mate with each other, theorizing that those which can mate had to have been physically close at one point. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Humans have independently evolved across hundreds of planets across a stretch of the Milky Way galaxy. The patterning of planets in the galaxy on which human species have developed reveals a pattern of stars, which is hypothesized by humans to be the path of their common ancestor. Furthermore, it appears that the path traced by their ancestor attempts to gather a representative sample of planets in the Milky Way. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ancestors\u2019 aim to find an inhabitable planet. Were the pattern extended, the original home of the common ancestors would be found, and to find this common home is the purpose of the expedition. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Across the galaxy, there are hundreds of species of humans; certain species are able to mate with others, despite them living in faraway areas with no possible contact before space travel. To make sense of these circumstances, the mission's team believes that one original ancestor exists from which all humans came from, and were then dispersed throughout the Milky Way. There is also a pattern in the ways human races can interbreed; humans can mate with other humans that were adjacent to each other two hundred thousand years ago, indicating that this historical proximity points to a source of the big ancestor. The mission of this expedition is to travel to that location in search of the big ancestor, hopefully gaining cultural insight into the species as well as their superior biological abilities that make them able to mutate and improve themselves."

        "Summary_1": "The story is set in a space ship of an expedition with the goal of finding human\u2019s original home. The universe has many species of human beings at different development levels, and four of them are on board of the ship. They seem to believe that there is a planet of origin, where they evolved. They assume that later, they were brought from the original planet to the planets they now live on. There was another ship that passed the expedition ship, which allow the explorers to send their pilot home since he is sick. They learn that there is a Ribboneer on that ship. The Ribboneer is a pilot and has been to some expeditions. Thus, the team want to have him on board and be the pilot of their ship. Hence, they start to explain about their theories in trying to find out about human race and their origin. The Ribboneer is interested and decides to join the team. Later, they notice that the plants are being eaten by some animals. Thus they put on a show at the hydroponics to trick the animals. Later, we follow Halden and Meredith to Halden\u2019s cabin where they have an argument over the level of development they have and Halden punches Meredith\u2019s nose. Then, the story ends with the two of them in Halden\u2019s room. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on a ship in space settled in the Milky Way. There is a projector on the spaceship that Kelburn uses to explain their theory of the origins of Man. The ship is quite isolated as it is currently located four months away from the nearest planet. The ship they are on is old, which creates some problems for them when trying to find a pest. The ship had new equipment added to its old frame, this has created hard to reach corners and small crevices that cannot be fixed without a proper rebuilding effort. There is a plant growing area on the ship that does not use soil in its growing. Halden has his own cabin on the ship. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place in a human spaceship, floating in the expanse of space next to another ship. Prior to the start of the story, the human pilot falls ill and is unable to be treated with the resources on their ship. Fortunately, another ship, the one now idling next to the human ship, was passing and has agreed to return the pilot home. Coincidentally, a passenger of the other ship, Taphetta, is a ribbonrer, a species known for their navigational skills, and agrees to pilot the human ship on their expedition. \n\tLater in the story, when Meredith and Halden are monitoring the goings-on in the hydroponics room, they are in a room with a big screen displaying a night-vision feed of the hydroponics room. Meredith and Halden then return to Halden\u2019s room. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on the expedition team's ship, which is in an unknown part of space. The ship is designed for humans, making Taphetta's comfortability a bit more difficult to achieve, as indicated by his dissatisfaction with the air quality. The ship contains tanks of plants that, when running smoothly, produce oxygen to supply the ship. The ship also contains cabins for each team member. Outside the ship, not much is visible that indicates location; the only thing visible out the window is a neighboring ship from which Taphetta was pulled from."

        "Article": " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n  \n \n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n  \n \n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n  \n \n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n  \n \n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n  \n \n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n  \n \n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n  \n \n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n  \n \n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n  \n \n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n  \n \n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n  \n \n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n  \n \n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n  \n \n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "A spaceship named Quest III is moving towards a color-changing star, but this time it is the Sun. The crew is excited, their journey is coming to its end and they are coming home. The captain says they have sighted Earth. Talking burst out happily, the captain's wife is anxious about nothing being the same after nine hundred years on Earth, while it was only ten for the crew in space. The course to Earth is set and the whole crew is filled with anticipation. The captain can't find how to kill time and delves into upsetting thoughts about the failure of the venture. The captain rewatches his record from the beginning of the voyage. It shows his hopes fading with every new planet proving unfit for settlement and the Earth years increasing rapidly and frighteningly. By then, the captain had an idea of going to Omega Centauri without returning to Earth, as this planet was more than forty thousand years away from Earth. The reasoning was that the captain didn't want to bring news of a failure to Earth, but eventually he decided to return no matter what. Back to reality, the captain starts thinking about his awaiting future on Earth, when a jar goes  through the ship. Very soon the captain calms down, considering a meteoroid to be the reason, but a call informs him the ship is attacked by other ships. The captain rushes up joined by his son, the whole crew is panicking. The ship is not harmed though and still landing, as there is no other place for it to go. The attack seems well-planned and the crew broadcasts an audio wave, asking the attackers who they are and introducing themselves. There is no answer and Zost, a crew member, traces no lights or urban features on Earth, even no trees or grass are detected. Suddenly, a strange voice acknowledges that the other two ships were destroyed, and Quest III will be as well if it continues towards Earth. The captain learns out soon that the voice simply tries to frighten them and is not that confident, and is told that Quest I preferred suicide to defeat and went into the Sun. The vision connection happens and the man on the other side avoids the question why, proclaiming that the Quest III's crew must die. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Quest III has spent ten years on a voyage into space in search of a habitable planet for humanity to live on following an overpopulation crisis on Earth. However, because of space travel and how it warps time, the ten years on Quest III have actually been 900 years on Earth, and now, after failing to find said planet, the ship is returning home. The captain of Quest III, Knof Llud, reports to the crew that they have identified Earth, and the crew is excited and emotional about the prospect of going home. Llud's wife, Lesra, expresses fear about what the ship would be returning to on Earth, but Llud reassures her. Llud finds Den, the Navigator, who asks him about the reception they would get when returning to Earth. Llud goes to his cabin, feeling drained from the voyage, and reflects on the past ten years, watching old tapes documenting the trip and its discoveries. He notes another discovery that the ship had made about Omega Centauri, a global cluster that could have been the home of a planet for humanity. However, Llud had to choose between returning to Earth and going to Omega Centauri because of limited fuel on the ship, and he had hesitantly decided to return home. As Quest III approaches Earth, they are attacked by unknown spacecrafts. Fearful, the crew analyzes the spacecrafts, which are surprisingly small. Quest III has a strong armor, but the crafts repeatedly attack the ship, with more and more approaching. The crew notes these as robot crafts, but it is soon discovered that they are tiny spaceships. Since the last 900 years on Earth, humans have gotten smaller, eventually evolving into minuscule beings. One of the small men reveals that Quest I had returned and also been attacked before surrendering and flying into the Sun, and advises that Quest III do the same. Llud asks them why they want to kill Quest III, to which they respond that they \"must die\"",

The space ship that is set to explore the space and find some planet that might be suitable for living, since Earth has reached a dangerously unstable phase. Due to the time axis of a space ship approaching light speed, it has been only ten years for thee passengers aboard on the ship. The story begins with Knof Llud, the captain of Quest III, announcing that they have sighted Earth. Though it just appears as a featureless disk on the telescope, people cheered and cried. Then the captain\u2019s wife, Lesra, seems to be worried about what has happened to Earth during this nine hundred years that they were gone. She worries that they won\u2019t fit in, and everything they once were familiar with are different now. During this few hours before they reach Earth, the captain goes to his private office-cabin and started to view records of their trip. He first views one among the earliest. In the record, he was energetic and, despite a blank visit to Procyon, there was idealism. Then the captain selected a later one where they still have not find any planets. They are starting to believe that the Sun\u2019s world is a rare accident. Finally he takes a record that is only four years old, when they\u2019ve reached the furthest point from Earth, according to the plan. While they could have gone to Omega Centauri, a cluster of stars twenty thousand light years away. They decided to turn back and return to Earth. \n\nSuddenly, as they get close to Earth, they are under attack by a few very small ships. The captain was relieved since those small ships does not carry large enough weapons to damage  Quest III, the crew on board almost do not feel the vicious onslaught being done to their ship. As more and more groups of attackers arrive, while some of the earlier ones go back for refill of ammunition, they start to get worried and believe that this is a planned attack. They start to broadcast questions asking the attacker to identify themselves. Finally, the images of Earth arrive, and to their surprise, it seems as if mold has covered all the cities. Then the attackers\u2019 voice comes back, stating that they know who they are and tells them to stop coming toward Earth, or they will be destroyed like the other Quest ships. ",

The crowd reacts openly with feelings of excitement and joy. His wife, Lesra, expresses her own feelings of nervousness about the unknown that Earth brings. The captain too has his own doubts. \n\nThe ship gets closer to Earth and they are able to experience the Sun. The Navigator, Gwar Den, asks the captain if he has any thoughts about the reception they might receive upon their return. The captain says no one can be sure. Knof goes to his private office cabin to wait until there is more news about their approach to Earth. As he is waiting, he thinks through the 900 Earth years that he has spent on the ship. He listens through recordings of himself when he was much younger and relives the feelings it felt at the time. He thinks about how he had the option to pursue an expedition of the globular cluster of Omega Centauri but instead chose to return to Earth. He cannot think of why he really chose to return to Earth besides the longing and familiarity it had. \n\nDuring the captain\u2019s time of reflection, there is a sudden jolt on the ship. The captain because confused about the potential trouble. He is informed by Den that the ship is being attacked. He orders the alarms to be sound in response. Den details that there are multiple tiny crafts attacking their ship. The attacks were not damaging the ship, but they were dangerous because they were depleting the already very limited fuel supply. \n\nEventually, the attackers make contact with the Quest III.

        "Summary_1": "The captain is very responsible concerning his position and keeps an impassive voice and appearance in relation to all events. To his wife though he shows warmth and care, and expresses confidence in Earth's stability, he calms down his wife. Nevertheless, he also feels uncertain about the reception on Earth. Space is the captain's passion, but Earth is still his home. He is nervous about returning and alone with himself doesn't know how to distract. He becomes nostalgic rewatching the records from the beginning of the voyage and feels empty and old. He used to be full of excitement and energy about the mission, but it failed, and at some point he didn't even want to return with the news of failure after centuries, when everything changed. Nevertheless, the decision was made and there is no other choice now. The trip has changed the captain and now he feels aged and tired. He wants to retire and live with his family on Earth, he becomes nostalgic of its forests and green places, but not sure he wants it either. ",
        "Summary_2": "The captain, Knof Llud, has dedicated ten years to running Quest III and searching for a place for humanity to live. He is a reassuring and comforting presence for the crew, and he comforts his wife about how they will manage returning to Earth. However, Llud internally feels a sense of disappointment and hopelessness when it comes to the failure of his voyage. He is also uncertain about his decision to return to Earth instead of going on to Omega Centauri, and is unsure why he made the decision in the first place. ",

From the records, we learn that the captain was first very excited and energetic to find a planet that is suitable for them. However, as the trip continues, the captain starts to believe that the Sun\u2019s world is somewhat of a rare accident. Then later, when they reach the furthest point of their plan, the captain knows the hope is small. But instead of going to the Omega Centauri where a large cluster of stars exist, the captain decides to turn back. Even though they\u2019ve failed their mission on finding a new planet to settle, the captain knows that he is still a part of Earth, he has to come back. ",
        "Summary_4": "The captain, Knof Llud, has his doubts of returning to Earth. He is nervous about the unknown that might await them. They have been gone from Earth for hundreds of generations and it cannot be predicted what awaits them on their return. He is in general uneasy about what could be waiting for them. The Captain recollects how he was hopeful in the beginning that they would be able to return to Earth and still see those they knew. However, as the voyage continued and they did not find anything hospital, he became more philosophical. "

The purpose was for the ships to find a sun similar to the Sun somewhere in space, and a planet to live on, in case Earth will become unfit. This mission was of extreme importance for the whole of humanity and the crew felt honored and ready to sacrifice all they were leaving on Earth. Nevertheless, they kept hoping to return as fast as possible, but every sun was unfit. The amount of fuel for no more than one thousand Earth years was loaded before departure and the fairest point to reach was chosen. All three ships went different ways, and were cut from any communication.

Thus three space ships were built, which exhausts the economy. Each ship, Quest, will try to find a habitable planet by going into the space from star to star.

Once a habitable planet is found, they will return to Earth, however they never find one and have to return after reaching the furthest point of their plan. ",

Earth had begun overpopulated and humans needed to expand out of their solar system. Ships, along with Quest III, were created to search for other planets in the universe. The ships that were built were extremely costly and laborious. They required a united effort from all on Earth. The effort was energized by the hope that the human race would be able to continue and expand elsewhere in the universe.  There was hope that they would be able to return before a century on Earth, but those dreams were not realized. "

He shrugged the thought aside. If they\nwere, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a\nsuggestion of urgency\u2014there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of\ninformation.\n  \n \n  Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser.\nHe knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time.\nAnd the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  would not complete its orbit of the planet for\ntwo weeks yet.\n  \n \n  Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used\nto wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the\nvicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went\nback inside.\n  \n \n  Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the\ncaptain himself:\n  \n \n  WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR\nSCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN ORDER!\n  \n \n  H.

For some reason, it seemed too trivial for\nserious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only\nto the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment.\nIt was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from\nthe ship on his trip.\n  \n<doc-sep>The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was\nher size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained\nsuch gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand\nfeet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable\nalienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully\nin the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with\nsomething like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff\nwere somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some\nstrange and alien way.\n  \n \n  It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for\ninter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of\nmystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave\nher birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was\nunthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she\nwas drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung\nabout Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away\nagain into the inter-stellar deeps.\n  \n \n  Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps\nyesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip\nthat bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We\nwould never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond\nthe ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know\nwhat killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she\nwas mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ...\nbut of what?\n  \n \n  We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would\nhave meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better\nequipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by\nmen. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank.\nLet the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and\nbrought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things\nfigured.\n  \n \n  The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed\nby the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared\na boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth\nmillions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and\ncrossed to her.\n  \n \n  In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their\nfaces.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit\nher tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives.\nShe's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage\ncompartments that are still unbroken.\"\n  \n \n  She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was\nnothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull\nalone was left.\n  \n \n  He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples\nof her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this\nstuff....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The\ncarcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and\nZaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her\ndown under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check\nthose compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When\nit's done report to me in my quarters.\"\n  \n \n  I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a\nmetallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff\nis worth anything....\"\n  \n \n  The metal was heavy\u2014too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship\nconstruction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that\ndistant world where this metal was made?\n  \n \n  Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal\ntorn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver;\nthose strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were\nthere too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of\nthe metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand.\n   \n   It had a\nyellowish tinge, and it was heavier\n   \n  ....\n  \n \n  Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held\nit grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm.\nSuddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It\nstruck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of\nmetallic lustre.\n  \n \n  For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying\nall the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a\nbalance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It\nwas no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The\nwhorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing\nvibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had\ndrawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal\u2014the\nstuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was\nbuilt\u2014was now....\n  \n \n \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my\ntable-top.\n   \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps,\nfrom some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ...\ndrawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability\nin its new environment. Stability as a terrene element\u2014wonderfully,\nmiraculously gold!\n  \n \n  And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of\nthis metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have\nbeen a wild sound in those moments of discovery....\n  \n",

        "Summary_3": "The Omega Centauri is space clustered with stars in comparison to a few dozen in the Sun\u2019s neighborhood, but it is twenty thousand light years away. While Quest III could get to Omega Centauri with its remaining fuel, it can only be a one-way journey. Moreover, even if it has enough fuel for the round trip, forty thousand years would have passed, there is no point in returning, when it is unclear if human race itself still remains. Most importantly, the crew has been showing signs of homesick, despite the fact that what was known as home is probably gone. From the joy an tears of the passengers once they acknowledge Earth has been sighted, we know \u2013 they are happy and want to return home. Just as Llud stated, he is still a part of Earth. ",
        "Summary_4": "Omega Centauri was a globular cluster that had a hundred thousand stars in a comparatively small volume. There was hope that Omega Centauri of all places would possess the planet necessary for human survival. The issue was that it was twenty thousand light-years away. With the limited fuel reserves that the Quest III ship had left, going to Omega Centauri would be a one-way trip. If the globular cluster proved to be as useless as every other location, the ship and its crew members would have no fuel to go anywhere else. Earth was a safer option because its existence was reality, at least when the ships left 900 Earth years ago. Omega Centauri was very uncertain. "

The stranger is offering the two a lot of money for their circus. Jig does not feel comfortable with the stranger but is willing to set aside his uneasiness because they desperately need the money that the stranger is offering. They begin to listen to what the stranger is offering \u2013 a charter to their circus for money and negotiate details about monetary compensation.

While in the spaceport, Bucky expresses that he wants to go see Gertrude. Jig does not. They go down a dark hallway in search of Gertrude. Jig smells a sour and wild scent emanating in the area. They hear loud screaming and can sense that Gertrude is suffering because she cannot find someone to mate. Jig emphatically tells Gow that it is impossible because a male cansin has never been seen nor proven to exist. \n\nSoon chaos is let loose.

        "Summary_4": "Bucky Shannon and Jig are the heads of Shannon's Imperial Circus, a circus that tours around space. They are sitting in a bar, defeated due to the lack of success in their circus. Bucky and Jig are out of money with their circus in pathetic condition. They are then interrupted by a small man who asks for Bucky, holding a large amount of money. Bucky introduces himself and Jig, and the man introduces himself as Beamish. Beamish has taken an interest in Shannon's Imperial Circus and offers to charter it, proposing that the circus make a tour on the settlements along the Tehara Belt, on Venus. Jig, not wanting to seem too desperate or reveal the state of the circus to Beamish, is hesitant at first, saying they would have to cancel on events. The three are interrupted by Gow, the circus' zoo-keeper, who informs Bucky that Gertrude, a Venusian cansin that is the star of the circus, is not doing well. Beamish is impressed at the presence of a cansin, given there is only one other animal of the species. Jig names a price of one hundred U.C's for Beamish to join the partnership. Though a large amount of money, Jig advises that it is reserved for the men they owe it to. Bucky and Jig return to the circus spaceport, where they meet a group of men and give them money, then proceed to beat the group of men up. Once inside, Bucky convinces Jig to see Gertrude with him, and once they see her, they notice that she is in terrible condition. Gow informs them that Gertrude wants a mate, which is practically impossible because there are only two known cansins. Jig tells Gow to do what he can to help Gertrude, as him and Bucky head to bed. Once they start to rest, they wake in a panic as the Vapor snakes attack them, having escaped in the night. Jig awakes, injured, and Bucky concludes that they have been sabotaged by whoever let the snakes out. They suspect Beamish as the culprit, but sign his contract anyway out of a need for money. They then go on their trip to Venus, stopping at Nahru and meeting with Beamish and the gang. On their way to a bar, they come across Sam Kapper, a hunter who supplies animals to attractions. Kapper is in visible pain. They take him into the bar, asking him what had happened. Kapper eventually tells them that he has found a male cansin, but before he can say where, he dies.

        "Article": " \n  The Blue Behemoth\n  \n \n  By LEIGH BRACKETT\n  \n \n  Shannon's Imperial Circus was a jinxed\n   \n  space-carny leased for a mysterious tour\n   \n  of the inner worlds. It made a one-night\n   \n  pitch on a Venusian swamp-town\u2014to\n   \n  find that death stalked it from the\n   \n  jungle in a tiny ball of flame.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1943.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He\nknocked over the pitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  , but it didn't matter. The pitcher\nwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\nvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\nspring them.\n  \n \n  \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\ndown the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\"\n  \n \n  \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\na curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\nI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\nSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\n  \n \n  \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a\nlot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\nI've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\neleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!\nNothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\n  \n \n  I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\nBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face\nunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\n  \n \n  Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\ngrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\ngirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\nslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\ntoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\n  \n \n  I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\nShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.\n  \n \n  I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\n  \n \n  Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\nShannon?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\npleasantly and said, very gently:\n  \n \n  \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\n  \n \n  I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if\nhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\nsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\n  \n \n  The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\nin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\ngrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\nclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\nwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\n  \n \n  There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\nblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I don't think you understand.\"\n  \n \n  I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\nback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\ngot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\nand let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\n  \n \n  Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\n  \n \n  I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\nIt knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\nquivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\n  \n \n  Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you,\nJig? I'm not going to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\"\n  \n \n  The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm\nShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\nthe table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\n  \n \n  The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\nstayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\nthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\never met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more\nthan you could see through sheet metal.\n  \n \n  I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,\n\"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\nlike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\n  \n \n  The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\nBeamish. I wish to\u2014ah\u2014charter your circus.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n  \n \n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't\nsay anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\npitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  on the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n  \n \n  \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n  \n \n  Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\nindependent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\nthe burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\nstarted to get up. I kicked him under the table.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\n  \n \n  He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\nignored him. He went on, quietly,\n  \n \n  \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\nvaluable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\ntoil and boredom....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"Sure, sure. But what was your idea?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are many towns along the Venusian frontiers where no\nentertainment of the\u2014\n   \n   proper\n   \n  sort has been available. I propose to\nremedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\na tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n  \n \n  Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\nspeak, and I kicked him again.\n  \n \n  \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel\nseveral engagements....\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n  \n \n  \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n  \n \n  The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\nglared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n  \n \n  It was Gow, our zoo-man\u2014a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\ncolony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\nscenery\u2014scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\ncurtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\nthan the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n  \n \n  Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude\nain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to\nfit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome,\nsee? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot\nship'll hold her.\"\n  \n \n  He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\ncleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\nfinished for him.\n  \n \n  \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\nVenusian\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\nBrothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n  \n \n  She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be\na little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\nwouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking\ncircus than even I could stand.\n  \n \n  Beamish looked impressed. \"A\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . Well, well! The mystery\nsurrounding the origin and species of the\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  is a fascinating\nsubject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n  \n \n  We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have\nat least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n  \n \n  It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\nBeamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\nsecond I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\nstomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\nagreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\noff half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n  \n \n  \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\nthe morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n  \n \n  We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\ngrab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n  \n \n  \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\nHere.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We\ncan get lushed enough on this.\"\n  \n \n  Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\nhe said suddenly,\n  \n \n  \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\"\n  \n \n  \"It may be crooked.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I\nyelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\nwhere the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\npoked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\n   \n   thildatum\n   \n  !\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Bucky, the owner, is of a rather idealistic opinion of the circus. He considers it great and he loves the participants as they are loyal and good. Jig is rather realistic, he knows the circus is broken and lousy, with Gertrude, the huge cansin, being the only worthy creature, though even she is old. Jig is also not that fond of many creatures, he sees them as ugly, some scary, some absurd. The state of Gertrude made Bucky cry, and soon he confessed that he actually knows that the circus is not great, but he loves it no matter what. Jig tried to be practical and asked Gow to snap Gertrude out of this state for the good of the circus. Nevertheless, even Jig was touched by the creature's appearance and gaze full of grief, her screams made him tremble. The Nahali woman, claiming to smell death, made Jig feel anxious and scared. Throughout the story Jig keeps feeling uneasy around the creatures and tries to avoid them, limiting the interactions to business. Bucky, at the same time, sympathizes with them and tries to get closer. ",
        "Summary_2": "Bucky and Jig's attitudes towards the cirsus are very different. Jig thinks over the circus as a dump. It is merely a means of staying afloat financially for him. The things of the performers as uncivilised, unintelligent and below him. He looks down upon their superstitions and beliefs. He hates the beasts that are used in the circus, as they somehow make him feel less human. He hates that the circus itself is run down, as they are broke. \nBucky on the other hand loves the circus. He thinks of the performers as family. It is his pride and joy and he is willing to fight anyone who says otherwise, including Jig. He checks up on Gertrude, clearly showing his affection for her. He knows that the circus is run down, but he loves it still. It's like his child. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Jig shouts at Bucky that he knows the circus is in a lousy and mangy state where nothing is working. He is not satisfied with the circus and believes that it \u201cstinks\u201d. Bucky also states that he does not believe the circus is doing well, though he is not happy when Jig agrees with these assertions enthusiastically. Gertrude is a member of their circus and they describe her as temperamental. While they do not believe the circus is doing well, they feel loyal to the members of their circus. Bucky relates to Jig that he is happy they have been loyal to him and he wants to reward them for that. Bucky loves the circus no matter how ugly or no good the members appear or act. ",
        "Summary_4": "Bucky and Jig have a soft spot for their circus, having run it for eleven years. Jig is aware of the state of the circus, with Bucky in slight denial but eventually accepting its condition. What once was the Greatest Show in Space has become a broken, unappealing attraction. However, due to the amount of time that Bucky and Jig have devoted to the circus, it is their only source of purpose and income. Despite the unhopeful state of the circus, they both try to remain optimistic about improving it, leading to their contract with Beamish and their concern over Gertrude. "

From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n  \n \n  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale.

Slowly the flaring snout of his\nweapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig\nsuddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him.

Jig stops Bucky and the three of them begin to discuss business. Jig tries to show off the circus and asks for more money than it\u2019s worth. He is suspicious of the man, but they make a deal.

Jig is really pushing his luck with this offer, ready to haggle, but Beamish agrees on the fee. When Bucky tries to take the money as soon as they get it, Beamish has to take it from him, giving it to the various men waiting outside to be paid.

We didn't\nsay anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\npitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  on the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n  \n \n  \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n  \n \n  Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\nindependent means, gentlemen.

I propose to\nremedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\na tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n  \n \n  Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\nspeak, and I kicked him again.\n  \n \n  \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel\nseveral engagements....\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n  \n \n  \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n  \n \n  The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\nglared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n  \n \n  It was Gow, our zoo-man\u2014a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\ncolony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\nscenery\u2014scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\ncurtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\nthan the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n  \n \n  Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude\nain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to\nfit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome,\nsee? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot\nship'll hold her.\"\n  \n \n  He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\ncleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\nfinished for him.\n  \n \n  \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\nVenusian\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\nBrothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n  \n \n  She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be\na little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\nwouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking\ncircus than even I could stand.\n  \n \n  Beamish looked impressed. \"A\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . Well, well! The mystery\nsurrounding the origin and species of the\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  is a fascinating\nsubject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n  \n \n  We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have\nat least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n  \n \n  It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\nBeamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\nsecond I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\nstomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\nagreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\noff half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n  \n \n  \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\nthe morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n  \n \n  We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\ngrab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n  \n \n  \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\nHere.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We\ncan get lushed enough on this.\"\n  \n \n  Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\nhe said suddenly,\n  \n \n  \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\"\n  \n \n  \"It may be crooked.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I\nyelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\nwhere the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\npoked his head outside. \"Hey, boy! More\n   \n   thildatum\n   \n  !\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines\nof his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\nwith mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n  \n \n  He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it\nand brought it out.\"\n  \n \n  The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\nme,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n  \n \n  \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\ngot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n  \n \n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n  \n \n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n  \n \n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cansin\n   \n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n  \n \n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n  \n \n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n  \n \n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Selak\n   \n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n  \n \n  I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  The Blue Behemoth\n  \n \n  By LEIGH BRACKETT\n  \n \n  Shannon's Imperial Circus was a jinxed\n   \n  space-carny leased for a mysterious tour\n   \n  of the inner worlds. It made a one-night\n   \n  pitch on a Venusian swamp-town\u2014to\n   \n  find that death stalked it from the\n   \n  jungle in a tiny ball of flame.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1943.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Bucky Shannon leaned forward across the little hexagonal table. He\nknocked over the pitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  , but it didn't matter. The pitcher\nwas empty. He jabbed me in the breastbone with his forefinger, not\nvery hard. Not hard enough to jar the ribs clean loose, just enough to\nspring them.\n  \n \n  \"We,\" he said, \"are broke. We are finished, through. Washed up and\ndown the drain.\" He added, as an afterthought, \"Destitute.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at him. I said sourly, \"You're kidding!\"\n  \n \n  \"Kidding.\" Shannon put his elbows on the table and peered at me through\na curtain of very blond hair that was trying hard to be red. \"He says\nI'm kidding! With Shannon's Imperial Circus, the Greatest Show in\nSpace, plastered so thick with attachments....\"\n  \n \n  \"It's no more plastered than you are.\" I was sore because he'd been a\nlot quicker grabbing the pitcher. \"The Greatest Show in Space. Phooey!\nI've wet-nursed Shannon's Imperial Circus around the Triangle for\neleven years, and I know. It's lousy, it's mangy, it's broken-down!\nNothing works, from the ship to the roustabouts. In short, it stinks!\"\n  \n \n  I must have had the pitcher oftener than I thought. Nobody insults\nBuckhalter Shannon's Imperial Circus to Buckhalter Shannon's face\nunless he's tired and wants a long rest in a comfy fracture-frame.\n  \n \n  Shannon got up. He got up slowly. I had plenty of time to see his\ngrey-green eyes get sleepy, and hear the quarter-Earth-blood Martian\ngirl wailing about love over by the battered piano, and watch the\nslanting cat-eyes of the little dark people at the tables swing round\ntoward us, pleased and kind of hungry.\n  \n \n  I had plenty of time to think how I only weigh one-thirty-seven to\nShannon's one-seventy-five, and how I'm not as young as I used to be.\n  \n \n  I said, \"Bucky. Hold on, fella. I....\"\n  \n \n  Somebody said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen. Is one of you Mister Buckhalter\nShannon?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon put his hands down on his belt. He closed his eyes and smiled\npleasantly and said, very gently:\n  \n \n  \"Would you be collecting for the feed bill, or the fuel?\"\n  \n \n  I shot a glance at the newcomer. He'd saved me from a beating, even if\nhe was a lousy bill-collecter; and I felt sorry for him. Bucky Shannon\nsettled his shoulders and hips like a dancer.\n  \n \n  The stranger was a little guy. He even made me look big. He was dressed\nin dark-green synthesilk, very conservative. There was a powdering of\ngrey in his hair and his skin was pink, soft, and shaved painfully\nclean. He had the kind of a face that nice maiden-ladies will trust\nwith their last dime. I looked for his strong-arm squad.\n  \n \n  There didn't seem to be any. The little guy looked at Shannon with pale\nblue eyes like a baby, and his voice was softer than Bucky's.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I don't think you understand.\"\n  \n \n  I felt cold, suddenly, between the shoulders. Somebody scraped a chair\nback. It sounded like he'd ripped the floor open, it was so quiet. I\ngot my brassies on, and my hands were sweating. Bucky Shannon sighed,\nand let his fist start traveling, a long, deceptive arc.\n  \n \n  Then I saw what the little guy was holding in his hand.\n  \n \n  I yelled and knocked the table over into Bucky. It made a lot of noise.\nIt knocked him sideways and down, and the little dark men jumped up,\nquivering and showing their teeth. The Martian girl screamed.\n  \n \n  Bucky heaved the table off his lap and cursed me. \"What's eating you,\nJig? I'm not going to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up,\" I said. \"Look what he's got there. Money!\"\n  \n \n  The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. \"Delighted. I'm\nShannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.\" He looked down at\nthe table. \"I'm sorry about that. Mistaken identity.\"\n  \n \n  The little guy smiled. He did it with his lips. The rest of his face\nstayed placid and babyish, almost transparent. I realized with a start\nthat it wasn't transparent at all. It was the most complete dead-pan I\never met, and you couldn't see into those innocent blue eyes any more\nthan you could see through sheet metal.\n  \n \n  I didn't like him. I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,\n\"Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking\nlike hungry cats at a mouse-hole.\"\n  \n \n  The little guy nodded. \"Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon\nBeamish.

        "Summary_1": "The first encounter between Beamish and the two occurred when Jig and Bucky were at the point of a fight. Beamish prevented them from this unnecessary action, and soon he saved the circus. The circus was broke, the performers were discontent with not getting their bills, the construction was loose, etc. There would be no tour and existence of the circus overall without this encounter. Being able to pay the gang, Jig and Bucky could show up without being afraid or ashamed to show up in their circus and keep doing business. This encounter was also somehow connected with the attempt to kill the two by letting the vapor snakes out. The trip to Venus in the end was also caused by this encounter, as it was the place where Beamish awaited for his partners and the gang. Therefore, he was somehow connected with them meeting Sam, a hunter supplying animals for the circus, and his eventual weird death. Beamish listening to their dialogue and overall investing in a broke circus creates a suspicion of his actions having some hidden reason. Together with the unhappiness of the gang and one creature smelling death, Beamish's unclear intentions seem scheming and threatening, adding to the intrigue of the whole story. ",
        "Summary_2": "The meeting of Jig, Bucky and Beamish is very significant in the story. When we meet Jig and Bucky, they are in deep financial trouble. They have absolutely no money at all. When they are approached by Beamish, Jig can tell that there's something strange about him. He seems to have no emotion at all in his face. Beamish offers to charter out their circus for 100 U.C's. It's unclear where Beamish's money comes from. Because they get the money, the duo are finally able to pay back the men that they have been avoiding for weeks. They take the ship to Venus, where they hope this trip will help them escape financial ruin. Because they are in Venus, they are able to meet Kepper, who tells them about the stolen cansin. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Beamish\u2019s entrance was a welcome interruption to Jig because it distracted and stopped Bucky from hitting him. Beamish is wanting to offer Bucky and Jig money to charter their circus for a tour of different settlements along the Tehara Belt. They would have never gone to Venus if not by the order of Beamish and thus they never would have met up with Sam as they did in the story. It is significant that they meet Beamish because according to the same Beamish is a male cansin and previously Bucky and Jig did not believe they existed anymore. ",
        "Summary_4": "Beamish gives Jig and Bucky a new opportunity for their circus. Before meeting Beamish, they were out of luck, their circus in lousy condition and no money to live off of or improve their attraction. However, when Beamish comes into the picture, they are offered a new chance to showcase their circus. Though the offer is a bit shady and not completely promising, Bucky and Jig prefer it over their current situation. Taking up Beamish's offer leads Bucky and Jig to a new tour on Venus."

        "Article": "\n  Jon\n  followed him through the sundered\nlock of the station. Karyl stopped for a\nmoment to examine the wreckage of the\nlock. It had been punched full of holes as\nif it had been some soft cheese instead of a\nmetal which Earthmen had spent nearly a\ncentury perfecting.\n  \n \n  \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue\nsaid. \"But that metal also is found on\nour world. It's probably the softest and most\nmalleable we have.

We need living room. You have\nstrategically placed planets for our use. We\nwill use them.\"\n  \n \n  Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had\nbeen preaching preparedness as Earth flung\nher ships into the reaches of the solar system,\ntaking the first long step toward the\nconquest of space.\n  \n \n  There are other races somewhere, they\nargued. As strong and smart as man, many\nof them so transcending man in mental and\ninventive power that we must be prepared to\nstrike the minute danger shows.\n  \n \n  Now here was the answer to the scientists'\nwarning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.\n  \n \n  \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue.\n\"I couldn't understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered.\nIt was a welcome surprise. Apparently his\nthoughts had to be directed outward, rather\nthan inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to\nread it.\n  \n \n  He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping\nlock of the invaders' space ship wondering\nhow he could warn Earth. The Space\nPatrol cruiser was due in for refueling at\nhis service station in 21 days. But by that\ntime he probably would be mouldering in\nthe rocky dust of the asteroid.\n  \n \n  It was pitch dark within the ship but the\nSteel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all\nmaneuvering through the maze of corridors.\nJon followed him, attached to one tentacle.\n  \n \n  Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular\nroom, bright with light streaming from\na glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently\nwere near topside of the vessel.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue, more massive than his\nguide and with four more pair of tentacles,\nincluding two short ones that grew from the\ntop of its head, spoke out.\n  \n \n  \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue\nnodded.\n  \n \n  \"You know the penalty?

Nearer and\nnearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrums\nwith booming savagery.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situation\nin which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. He\nlay on the parched, rocky soil of a\u2014a something. A planetoid, perhaps.\nAnd he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all the\nplanets that circle the Sun....\n  \n \n  Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. The\nchase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength,\nborn of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head.\n  \n \n  \"My\u2014my companions?\" he demanded weakly.\n  \n \n  The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massive\nof shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw,\nraven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk,\nloosed a satisfied grunt.\n  \n \n  \"Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!\"\n  \n \n  Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip\u2014but\nhe managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelm\nhim, and confronted the big man boldly.\n  \n \n  \"What,\" he stormed, \"is the meaning of this?\"\n  \n \n  The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then his\nraven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawed\nin boisterous mirth.\n  \n \n  \"Hear that?\" he roared to his companions. \"Quite a guy, ain't he?\n'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?\"\nThen he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement in\nhis eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. His\ntone assumed a biting edge. \"The meanin' is, my bucko,\" he answered\nmirthlessly, \"that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you have\na sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast and\nstraight!\"\n  \n \n  \"Talk?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nice\nhaul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way.\" The burly one\nchuckled coarsely. \"We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped matters\nout by comin' to us.\"\n  \n \n  Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend's\nominous warning. \"\u2014if your message was intercepted, you may have\nplayed into the hands of\u2014\" He said slowly, \"Then you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nLorelei's men?\"\n  \n \n  \"The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron\u2014where did\nit come from?\"\n  \n \n  And it occurred to Warren suddenly that although the big man\n   \n   did\n   \n  hold\nthe whip hand, he was still not in possession of the most important\nsecret of all! While the location of the ekalastron mine remained a\nsecret, a deadlock existed.\n  \n \n  \"And if I won't tell\u2014?\" he countered shrewdly.\n  \n \n  \"Why, then, sailor\u2014\" The pirate leader's hamlike fists tightened, and\na cold light glinted in his eyes\u2014\"why, then I guess maybe I'll have to\nbeat it out o' you!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto.

Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty.

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n  \n \n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n  \n \n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Seymour Pond has just retired from his career as the last astronaut from the Ultrawelfare State at the age of thirty. At his going away party he is given a watch, and academics like Lifting Gubelin and Dr Hans Girarad-Perregaux speak on his behalf. Si has decided to take the money he has saved up from his time working, which most people in the Ultrawelfare state don't, and live a simple comfortable life. He intends to never work again, after his six space flights. The currency used in the state was universal, controlled by a personal credit card. Because most jobs were automated, few people had to work, so most people lived off of a set welfare, and those selected to work were given a little extra compensation. Si was one of these people. Gubelin and Perregaux are both horrified by the fact that Pond has decided to take an early retirement. He was their only pilot for their space program, and if they were to get another, it would take at least a year of training. Without a pilot, they are worried that their funding will be cut, and the space program will be shut down. They scheme together as to how to get Pond back in the space program. They think that the only way to get him back would be to make sure he was left without any money, and therefore would have no choice but to return to his former position. \nSi is planning a big night out. He has always gone and celebrated when there was a cause, and tonight, he was planning to spend at least half of all the money in his account. He gets dressed in his retirement rank suit to go out, checks his balance, and then takes his vacuum tube to New york city. Before he leaves, he books a room at a swanky hotel for the rich and famous, and after a few moments, his car transports him to his room. There is an amazing view of the city, and from his room, gets ready to go to the bar. \nAt the bar he orders a drink, before noticing a beautiful woman beside him. They get to talking and before long, she tells him she recognises him, telling him about how moved she found his whole retirement ceremony. Making it very clear she wasn't happy he was retiring. He asks why she has an interest in space, to which she replies that she always has. He begins to explain the aspects of space flight, when the right side of his mouth begins to tick, and he knocks his drink back. ",
        "Summary_2": "In the Ultrawelfare State, the kind of jobs that one does is decided through a lottery. The lottery is drawn whenever there\u2019s a need for new employees. Those that work will receive some additional Variable Basic shares to be added to their portfolios. And once their portfolios reach a certain level of Variable Basic shares, they can afford to live the life in the way they prefer. The story begins with Seymour Pond, the space pilot that has been on six trips, receiving a gold watch and a banquet from the officials including Academician Lofting Gubelin, an anachronistic man, and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux to persuade him not to retire. Because there is no other space pilot at this time, and it takes a few months, if not a year, and much resources to train a new pilot ready to travel to the moon. But Pond\u2019s mind is set, he\u2019s had enough anxiety over space cafard, and he has quite a large amount of Variable Basic shares to support his living and to show off to the others. \n\nIn the escape room at Gubelin\u2019s Floridian home arguing with Girard-Perregaux, who states that he would do the same in the position that Pond is currently in. Because of the way that employment works in the Ultrawelfare State, Pond doesn\u2019t need to face danger anymore. The law does not even allow him to be selected to work again. Later, they decide to use the sailor way of life method to force Pond back to being a pilot again. \n\nPond is aware of the sailor way of life, and he does not want to spend his money in such a quick rush. After dressing himself in a great retirement-rank suit, he checks his balance and makes sure that he has enough money to spend. He goes to Manhattan and settles in a nicer room of the hotel, where he can see the Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson as well as the city. Then he decides to visit the Kudos Room for a drink where celebrities sometimes go. While he was disappointed to see no celebrities, he gets to talk to a beautiful girl who seems extremely interested in space travelling and admires him a lot. As he was explaining space cafard to the girl, he felt a tic on his mouth, so he quickly finishes his drink. ",
        "Summary_3": "Spacemen on a Spree begins at a banquet celebrating the retirement of Seymour Pond\u2019s, a space pilot. At the retirement banquet, Pond expresses smugness and content as he knows the program will not be viable without him. \n\nAfter the party, Hans and Gubelin discuss the significance of Pond\u2019s retirement. They are upset because the Department of Space Exploration is in jeopardy because they do not have another trained space pilot to replace Pond and it would take a long time to train one. Hans and Gubelin go back and forth discussing how best to convince Pond to return to the space pilot job. \n\nSeymour was grateful for each time he returned from his space runs and was ready to retire at the age of 30, which was allowed by the Ultrawelfare State. Once he is retired, Seymour expresses his desire to throw a big celebration. He intends to use a great deal of his money and wants to do so in a more controlled and lavish manner than he previously has. He dresses in a newly purchased suit and is careful to attach his space pin that clearly identifies his previous occupation. He takes transportation to a Manhattan hotel to execute his plan. He is satisfied with his hotel room and heads to the bar to enjoy some drinks. At the bar he sees a girl that he finds very attractive. The girl, Natalie Paskov, initially responds coldly to his attention but then becomes interested when she sees the space pin on his suit. Natalie then mentions that she recognizes him because she follows space news since it is an interest of hers. She expresses her sadness that he retired. The story ends with him talking about space cafard. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Seymour Pond is retiring from being a space pilot. Gubelin and Perregaux, big figures in space exploration, want to urge the man to stay as space has to be delved further into. The problem is that there are not enough young people willing to venture and explore the space. Pond is the only trained pilot in the world and they need him, while he has just enough fortune to retire with comfort. Without him the whole space exploration department will be terminated, so Gubelin and Perregaux think of means to deprive Seymour of his money and force him to go back to space. Seymour at that time is planning how to spend his money - he wants to spend a huge sum on the best entertainment. So, the ex-Space Pilot heads towards Manhattan in an automatic car. Seymour gets a luxurious room in a hotel and goes to get a drink in an expensive bar there. There he meets a graceful Oriental girl, and he offers her a drink. Soon she recognizes the famous pilot and starts treating him like a celebrity with utmost surprise of the possibility of talking to him. Turns out she is a huge fan of space and Seymour starts telling her things. "

The\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  was a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n  \n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie!\n  \n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n  \n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n  \n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n  \n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us\u2014me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour\u2014I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n  \n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\n   \n   Spacemen's\n   \n  ? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n  \n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n  \n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n  \n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to\n   \n   Guns for Ganymede\n   \n  ?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>II\n  \n \n  Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\nexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\nof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't\nbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his\nname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n  \n \n  When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\nwere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\nthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\nfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\ntaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\nthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\nhad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\ntake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n  \n \n  Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\na bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\ndangers met and passed.\n  \n \n  Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\nhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor\nneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n  \n \n  He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't\nany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the\nreputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\nfellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\nnot. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did\nyou need?\n  \n \n  It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n  \n \n  In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\nin adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\nThey had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\nworking hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\nIt finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\nbut two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\nbecame obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\nthirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\nto have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\nof them ever really becoming efficient.\n  \n \n  The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\nunemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\nunemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\nreasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\nand a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\nwere needed, a draft lottery was held.\n  \n \n  All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\nwere drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\nmight feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\ngranted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\nthey fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\ndividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\nsold for a lump sum on the market.\n  \n \n  Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\nvacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\nof his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\nobviously called for.\n  \n \n  He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd\naccumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\nto blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\nwas burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\nwasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n  \n \n  Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\nfell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\nrate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the\nclassiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\nall the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n  \n \n  Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\ncenturies since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\nthe tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's\nprofits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\nquite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\nmust leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\nusually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\nhurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\ndenied him.\n  \n \n  Si was going to do it differently this time.\n  \n \n  Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\nworks. But nothing but the best.\n  \n<doc-sep>Sitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to\nlet him have it at the first sight of actual violence.\n  \n \n  Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have\nnotified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the\ndeath of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"\n  \n \n  \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He's going to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun\ntrigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it\nsavagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the\nsword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of\nbluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\n  \n \n  Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door\nflew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the\ngreen sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down\nat the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\n  \n \n  \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.\n  \n \n  \"Y-yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint\nbeing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the\nuntimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of\nthe Ghrynian policemen.\n  \n \n  \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver\nof the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several\nminutes ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest\nyou for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than\n$100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the\nUniverse can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  responsible?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to\nthis late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, no, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Ultrawelfare State is a distant future society, based upon the main ideas of communism. Every person in the state is guaranteed shares in the society, which translates to money, food, clothes, housing, medical care and education. The money of the nation is doled out by the economic planning board, who determine how the communal wealth is spent. Everyone is given a universal credit card, which only they can access, and they can check their balances on the teevee phones. The way in which people are selected to work in the state is very interesting. In this society, most jobs are automated, so very few people are unfortunate enough to have to work. People are selected for different jobs based on their physical and mental qualifications. People who don't work have their assigned shares to live off of, and those that are selected to work are given a little extra as compensation. When the society was first formed, they tried to give everyone work, but they realised that it was no good to have people working for two hours, two days a week, so they created the draft lottery. Most people live in small apartments, and the fortunate living Si, are able to afford vacuum tubes, which can take you anywhere in an instant. It is only the swankiest of places that have real people working in them. All payment is automated, and different settings of rooms can be changed in an instant in fancy hotels. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Ultrawelfare State in the early days has attempted to give everyone work by providing  little amount of working hours and working days. It was not practical and people did not know their job well, thus it was not efficient. Hence later, the system is designed so that everyone at Ultrawelfare State finishes their basic education at the age of twenty-five, and they will be a part of the lottery for employment. Once they are drawn to serve in a certain industry, they cannot deny. Those at work, or are just employed will receive additional Variable Basic shares, which can be added to their portfolios, for more money, hence better and more comfortable life style. People that are born in the Ultrawelfare State obtain a number of Basic shares that allow them to enjoy the fundamental womb-to-tomb security, including food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education. \n\nThe Department of Space Exploration at Ultrawelfare State has only one pilot, who has just resigned, and they are close to terminate as their appropriastions for expeditions has been very difficult to obtain. But the officers there believe they are onto some important breakthrough. \n\nUsing vacuum-tube vehicles, one can travel between cities very quickly and it reaches their destination directly. Moreover, one can stay at a hotel room for ten minutes to check if they are satisfactory before confirming their stay by paying with their credit card. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Ultrawelfare State dictates the lives of its citizens. The State guarantees fundamental security through issues of Basic shares that provide enough income to secure food, clothing, medical care, shelter, and education. In the Ultrawelfare State, money is tightly restricted. No one else can use or steal or con a person out of their money. The State also regulates how labor is conducted. It conducts a labor draft that requires people to participate if their name is drawn. Individuals are given extra shares depending on their job assignments. ",
        "Summary_4": "People born in the Ultrawelfare State are issued a minimum number of Basic shares which guarantee right enough income for survival. Then people get basic education and work for the country's labour. A few people were driven to work, others just lived with their Inalienable Basic stocks. There is a department of space exploration in the state and its pilots get more Basic shares and can retire after six flights. The pilots are carefully chosen upon their qualifications as the profession is the most dangerous in the state. The job brings money for life more comfortable than most people in the state have. Nevertheless, young people do not want to venture and become space pilots, they don't have this desire for adventures. People in the state mostly don't contribute to its welfare and aren't needed. All jobs are done by machines, a human bartender, for example, is a sign of luxury. "

        "Article": " \n  SPACEMAN ON A SPREE\n  \n \n  BY MACK REYNOLDS\n  \n \n  Illustrated by Nodel\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of Tomorrow June 1963\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  What's more important\u2014Man's conquest\n   \n  of space, or one spaceman's life?\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n  \n \n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n  \n \n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n  \n<doc-sep>Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\nseemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\nthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\nman.\n  \n \n  He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\nalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\nactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\nthe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one\nneed face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the\nfact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n  \n \n  His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's\nleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the\npoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\ntake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\npilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\nexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\nincreasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in\n   \n   our\n   \n  minds, Hans, we are\nnear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\nspark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\nhold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\nto the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be\nthat the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\non Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\nExploration.\"\n  \n \n  \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n  \n \n  \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\nLooking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\nface took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\njustify the means?\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin blinked at him.\n  \n \n  The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\nfailed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read\nof the sailor and his way of life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\ndo with it?\"\n  \n \n  \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\nthan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\ntendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\nheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\nbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\nsea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\nfor years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talk\nof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\none short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\nheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\nwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\njail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\ncan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd\npersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\nthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n  \n \n  He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\nuniversal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\n\"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\nnobody can, ah,\n   \n   con\n   \n  you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\nour present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n  \n \n  The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\nmethods, my dear chap.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\ntypical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\nAcademician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\nwho still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\nhaving his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\neyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n  \n \n  That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\nGirard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\nGubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\ncourage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\nthe Ultrawelfare State.\n  \n \n  Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\nLofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\nbright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\nthe cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\nmiserably failed.\"\n  \n \n  Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\nIn his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\nPond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\nbeen trained. There aren't two men on North America\u2014there aren't two\nmen in the world!\u2014who better realize the urgency of continuing our\ndelving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\nus would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\nroad to his destiny.\"\n  \n \n  His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\ntraining forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers\nthroughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\nforesee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\nlack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\nadventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\nancestors did?\"\n  \n \n  Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\nand tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\npresent generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's\nway of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with\nthe unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous\npastimes.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap\nrebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\nreality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more\nthan is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\nUltrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\nsecurity by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\nsociety that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\nclothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\nof subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\ninto industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\npopulation is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\ndossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\nyou yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\nthe more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\ntrips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\nlife than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\nvery few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\nHe was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\nof drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\nmade his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\ndrafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\nfree from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\nour pleas for a few more trips?\"\n  \n \n  \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Gubelin and Perregaux know that they must get Pond back into their program, if they are going to save it from their funding being cut.  Perregaux tells Gubelin about a theory, where a sailor, who has been out at sea for many months, will always blow his hard earned money on one night out the minute he's back in town, no matter how much he wanted to save it. This is because of the loneliness of the sailor, and their need to make up for all the experiences that he has missed out on while he was at sea. The sailor will wake up the next morning, having spent all his money, without a cent to his name. Then, he will have to go back out to sea, to make back the money he has lost, so the cycle continues. Perregaux believes that Pond is this sailor, and if only they could set a trap for him, in which it would cause him to lose all his money in one night, he would have to go back to work for them. They plant Natalie Paskov, a beautiful woman at the bar where Pond goes. She interacts with him as if he's famous, stroking his ego. She then goes on to show her disdain for the idea that he has retired, and he orders them drinks. And so the night begins, with Pond starting to get drunk, and lose all his money to Natalie. ",
        "Summary_2": "Gubelin and Perregaux plan to get Pond back in the space program by a method similar to the sailor way of life, but a modern day version. The sailor normally goes on trips for months at the sea, where he dreams of his retirement and such. But once he reaches the port, he goes drinking, which leads to other things such as getting tattooed or even go to jail. Spending all of his money all at once, he has to go back to the sea for another trip. Gubelin and Perregaux have decided to use a similar method on Pond, so that he is forced to go back to the space program. ",
        "Summary_3": "Gubelin and Perregaux are desperate for Seymour not to retire because he is the only one capable of doing his job. Perregaux explains how they have to treat Seymour like a sailor from the past who is talking of retirement. A sailor would speak of retirement but then at a port, get too drunk, have a consequently messy night that ended with him in jail. The previous night would cause the sailor to have to continue to sail instead of retiring. They then suggest that they will have to adapt the pattern with more modern methods and apply them to Seymour. It can be assumed that Natalie, the woman he meets at the hotel bar, was sent by Gubelin and Perregaux to convince him to return to his job. ",
        "Summary_4": "For the two, the matter of bringing Seymour out of his retirement is essential. They have tried speeches about the importance of his missions and promises of enormous fame and wealth, but it didn't work. They are ready to use any means as they need Seymour to save their department. They want to make the ex-pilot lose all his money and need more. In their time it's almost impossible to steal someone's money. SO, the two decide to make him himself spend all his money. "

A. LOMBINO\n  \n \n \n   There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake\n    \n   a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel\n    \n   Walsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major\n    \n   Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories\n   \n  November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\n   \n  U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since\nwe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\n  \n \n  For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.\nHe might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as\nI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At\nleast, that's what he told me.\n  \n \n  I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\nsomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\nSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of\nit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and\nthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get\nby with gravy.\n  \n \n  \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\nhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\n  \n \n  I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on\nthe job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his\nfingers.\n  \n \n  \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then\nadded, \"For a native, that is.\"\n  \n \n  I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the\nway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.\nWhich brought to mind an important point.\n  \n \n  \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I\nthought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\n  \n \n  He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk\nas if he were waiting for me to cut.\n  \n \n  \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so\nhappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just\nwhat's happening on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very\nfar.\n  \n \n  \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If\nanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\n  \n \n  If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give\nthem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called\nit \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at\nleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\n  \n \n  \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never\nbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It\nwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported\nhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium\nthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\nHe still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by\nreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\nany military organization, he outranked me.\n  \n \n  \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n  \n \n  \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\nfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\nlike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\nPersonal habits? Anything?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like\nany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He\ndoes have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  The Code was rigid\u2014no fraternization with the\n   \n  peoples of other planets!

        "Summary_1": "Ponds was a space pilot for the department of space exploration. he had completed six space runs to the Moon, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. He hated every minute of it. Initially, he was drafted into the workforce reserves. He was soon. selected for the job based on his physical attributes and mental qualifications. He had to go through rigorous training once he was selected. This training took several years. After this he was put into the field. He was crammed in a small little space cafard for what seemed like endless amounts of time. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Pond was selected through the employment lottery system where at the age of twenty-five, after he finishes his basic education, he can be drawn to a specific job. He was drawn for space pilot. After his training, out of the twenty-three only him and another person passed the finals. From then on, he has been on six different runs: to the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars. His trips consist of extremely long time alone, long enough to possibly develop space cafard; the available room in the spaceship is super small, enough for getting claustrophobia. ",
        "Summary_3": "Seymour\u2019s retirement is significant because he is the only one capable of doing his job. During his job, he took 6 trips to space; 2 of the trips were to the moon. Each trip involved being in uncomfortable quarters and was dangerous. \n\nHe was selected for the job at 25 from the labor draft after he had finished his basic education schooling. His physical and mental capabilities made him eligible to train for the space pilot position. He trained along with 22 others and only him and one other person passed that level of training. The other person who passed died during a routine Moon run that had a faulty take-off. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Seymour Pond terminated his basic education and had the minimum of Basic shares in his pocket as everyone else. He got chosen for the labor draft - a small percent of people who had to work while others were unemployed and with their minimum fortune to live. Further, his mental and physical state made him eligible for the most dangerous position in the state - a space pilot. He couldn't and didn't want to decline and was put to trainings and then successfully passed the finals with another man. Seymour completed the six flights he was obliged to and retired. The dangerous job gained him extra shares and his fortune was much more than the average, adding to the fame he got. "

        "Summary_1": "Pond seems to be obsessed with money. At his retirement, he is given a gold watch. He thinks to himself how much better it would have been if they had simply given him money instead. He vows to live a simple, comfortable life, keeping an eye on his money so it will last him for the rest of his days. He is very proud of the fact that he can afford a luxury like his vacuum tube. Whenever something goes well in Pond's life, he loves to splurge on a night out. He ends up spending enormous amounts of money on things that he sometimes deems as \"sub-par\" for a man of his status. On this one fateful night, he decides that he deserves the best of everything. He is obsessed with the idea of wealth and fame, and checks himself into the nicest hotel he can think of in New York City, partially because he presumes he might see some celebrities there. He checks the balance on his credit card often, and when he goes down to the hotel bar, he has to restrain himself from checking how much a single drink costs. He looks around for signs of famous people, but is disappointed when he sees none. He gives into the flattery of Natalie when she gushes over him, as if he were famous, believing her obvious depciet, and buying her a drink. Fame and money are everything to Pond. ",

But he keeps on warning himself about not spending too much money so quickly, since he has been doing that multiple times before.

He  doesn't want any more trips even if they bring more wealth, he is good with small auto-apartment with a TV and having some good entertainment.

As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage.

        "Summary_1": "Liam O\u2019Leary is the captain of the guards at the Estates-General Correctional Institution (also known as the Jug). He starts off seeing a prisoner called Sue-Ann Bradley, who is having problems with a block guard named Sandro. She explains to him that Mathias, another prisoner, did not give her proper instructions and called the guards on her after ten minutes. O\u2019Leary gives Sue-Ann a warning, but Sandro informs him that she has already received a similar warning the day before. He changes his mind and sends her to three days in Block O. O\u2019Leary then begins to think about his job and how it is a good civil-service job. He then thinks about the figs (clerks) and how they are still important members of society even if there should not regularly be a cross between the barriers of the two classes. Sue-Ann, on the other hand, is taken to the Block O disciplinary block. The leading citizens, Flock, and Sauer begin shrieking at her as soon as she arrives. The guards exchange some words regarding the new additions to the block, and Sue-Ann walks through the gate to reach her cell. The two of them begin screaming and howling again. The guards are annoyed, and Sue-Ann starts to weep for real. Meanwhile, O\u2019Leary informs Warden Godfrey Schluckebier of the upcoming trouble he senses, but the warden brushes his concerns as nothing dangerous. The warden reminds O\u2019Leary that they each have their jobs to worry about. Suddenly, the warden gets a phone call, and he realizes that the call is made from Cell Block O by Flock. The events preceding this call cut back to Sue-Ann, who is still in her cell when Flock initially screams in agony. The guard issues a ten-minute rest period, and the tangler fields are turned off. While the inmates are getting up, the guard notices that Flock is still doubled over in pain due to his cramps. He unties the prisoner, but he sees a strange smell that is reminiscent of scorched meat. To his surprise, Flock threatens him with a hidden handmade shiv. Sauer and Flock take the guards hostage, and they threaten the warden to send a medic down for first aid for Flock. The warden then requests to speak to the governor, which triggers a huge effect on various events. Jets, rockets, and helicopters are sent to contain the possible breakout. There is also the possibility of riots starting. Everybody is fearful of what will happen once the inmates break out. However, even with this fearful anticipation from the outside world, the breakout does not seem to happen. ",
        "Summary_2": "Liam O'Leary is the captain of the \"Estates-General Correctional Institution\", also known as the \"Jug\". He is at a hearing for the inmate Sue-Ann Bradley, who has broken the rules of her imprisonment by not mopping the floor of her cell, and getting into a fight with another inmate. He sentences her to three days in \"Block O\", the section of the prison for inmates who cause trouble. O\"Leary is annoyed he has to punish the girl, as she seems to him like a decent enough person. It is revealed through by officer Sodaro, that the reason she is in the prison is for conspiracy to violate the Categorised Class laws. These laws were put in place long before, to fine comb different evolutionary traits in humanity, and to section off the people who fit these traits into groups. They all had specific jobs, they could only procreate in their section, and they could not move between \"specialisations\". \nSue-Ann is moved to Block O, or \"Greensleeves' ' where we meet the characters of Sauer and Flock. They are loud, and clearly disturbed. They seem to be permanent inmates of block O. Sue-Ann is let into the block, where Sauer and Glock begin to shout. She starts to weep. \nO'Leary speaks with the warden, he senses trouble coming. The warden tells O'leary that he's too suspicious, and that there's nothing to worry about. Soon, the warden gets a call, a call from Flock. Flock had made a shiv and taken over one of the guards, and grabbed Sauer. \nThe Warden calls the governor and word quickly spreads fast on the outside. A riot ensues in the lower class. The air forces prepare for an assault on the prison, and make their way there. But, when they get there, there is no breakout, not yet. The city of 19 million people waits. They wait for a breakout that never comes. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with the Captain of the guards, Liam O\u2019Leary, wondering how a particular detainee, Sue-Anne Bradley got to the prison. A guard is telling Liam that she has not been following orders so Liam is considering putting Sue-Ann in the disciplinary O-block. Sue claims that the treatment is unfair because she did not understand the orders that she was given. Eventually, Liam decides to send her to Block O for three days. He still wonders how or why she ended up in the institution when she had such a good advantage in life. \n\nLiam then begins to recount that he is proud of his job and is satisfied with being a part of the Civil Service class. He argues that he readily understands his place in society and does not understand why Sue-Ann does not understand her place in society. A prison guard guides Sue-Ann to her cell in the Greensleeves and it appears to the guard that Sue-Ann is crying. However, she is actually trying not to throw up from the sight of seeing Sauer and Flock, two other prisoners. Sauer and Flock are referred to as \u201cwipes\u201d and they both have spent a very long time in prison. They are causing a loud ruckus within the block and Sue-Ann does not understand why they have to scream so much. \n\nLater on, the Warden and O\u2019Leary are having a conversation about O\u2019Leary\u2019s concerns. The warden does not treat them as important and ignores Liam\u2019s claims. The Warden keeps putting blue pills in his coffee and they seem to make him feel better. His phone rings, wish he picks up with annoyance. The phone call causes the Warden to apologize to O\u2019Leary because presumably his concern was appropriate and there is currently a situation at the prison. \n\nThe situation occurs in the O Block area. A guard opens Flock\u2019s cell and goes to check on him because Flock seems to be in immense pain. Flock surprises him and points a shiv at the guard. Flock phones the warden and demands to be sent a medic because he is hurt. The Warden sends out an alert that there is a riot and the news spreads around fast outside of the institution and in the city-state. The outside world is terrified of the impending riot and prepares for its emergence. The outside world prepares by heavily arming the perimeter of the prison with jets, rockets, and helicopters. They wait for the inevitable so long that they have to refuel. The breakout seems to not be happening. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Liam O'Leary is a captain of guards in a correctional institution and he senses trouble. He sympathizes with a young detainee Bradley and wonders what got her mixed up with trouble when she possessed every advantage. She claims to have broken the rules due to a misunderstanding but he still has to punish her as Sodaro, the block guard, justly insists. The captain walks away thinking about specialization and the necessity of knowing one's place and being proud of whatever it is. Bradley is led to the disciplinary block and turns out women are rarely sent there. She falls in the beginning on the tangler field and shakes from disgust at the sight of two prisoner leaders. They yell and make sarcastic jokes and remind Bradley of animals causing her to weep. O'Leary tells the Warden about unnatural events taking place and the smell of trouble. The Warden wants them both to pay attention only to their own area of the job. A sudden call acknowledges the Warden of trouble. During the rest period in Block O Flock attacks the guard with a  hidden shiv causing pain to Flock himself. After holding the guard as a hostage, Flock and Sauer call the Warden and order to call a medic as Flock is hurt badly. The news of the riot spread immediately all around to the city governor, police departments, TVs, millions of people living near the Jug. The whole city is scared and prepares for the hugest breakout from the prison with guns and helicopters but it doesn't seem to come. "

And, what was more important, why she\ncouldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n  \n \n  He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n  \n \n  The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block\nguard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the\n   \n   Civil\nService Guide to Prison Administration\n   \n  : \"Detainees will be permitted\nto speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.\" And O'Leary\nwas a man who lived by the book.\n  \n \n  She burst out: \"I never got a chance!

And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and\ntold them I refused to mop.\"\n  \n \n  The block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk\u2014that's what she was telling you\nto do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Sodaro.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was\nattractive and young\u2014not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off\nto a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the\ndisciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and\nlooked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for\nhim to judge their cases.\n  \n \n  He said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your\ncell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you\nshould have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first\noffense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in\nthe mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The\nblock guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench,\nand she claimed the same business\u2014said she didn't understand when the\nother one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard\nwarned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\"\n  \n \n  Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I\ndon't care. I don't care!\"\n  \n \n  O'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\"\n  \n \n  It was the only thing to do\u2014for her own sake as much as for his. He\nhad managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted\nto say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up\nforever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was\nclearly the next step for her.\n  \n \n  All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet\nto Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here.\nWhat's she in for?\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to\nviolate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her,\nCap'n. She's a figger-lover!\"\n  \n \n  Captain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked\n\"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the\nsmell from his nose.\n  \n \n  What got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty\nbusiness? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the\nyard, wondering about her. She'd had every advantage\u2014decent Civil\nService parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If\nanything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and\nlook what she had made of it.\n  \n \n  The direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no\nexception, but with the difference that his is the one species that\ncreates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment\nthat clans formed, specialization began\u2014the hunters using the weapons\nmade by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the\nceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.\n  \n \n  Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From\nthe born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved\nto the point of smaller contact and less communication between the\nspecializations, until now they could understand each other on only the\nmost basic physical necessities\u2014and not even always then.\n  \n \n  But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree\nof civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation\nof each specialization\u2014social and genetic measures to make them\nbreed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man,\nor at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the\nspecializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer\nor Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized,\nwould be good at no specialization.\n  \n \n  And the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups\nare the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal\nenforcement of a demonstrable fact.\n  \n \n  \"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and\ntouched his cap as O'Leary passed by.\n  \n \n  \"Evening.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>O'Leary choked back his temper. \"Warden, I'm telling you that there's\ntrouble coming up. I smell the signs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last.\n  \n \n  \"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with\nall your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee,\nmade a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not\nnoticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into\nit this time.\n  \n \n  He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you\ntonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the\u2014'\nOh, curse the thing.\"\n  \n \n  His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.\n  \n \n  That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary;\nthey gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What\nthe devil do you want? Don't you know I'm\u2014What? You did\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\nYou're going to WHAT?\"\n  \n \n  He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.\nWhatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like\nclamshells in a steamer.\n  \n \n  \"O'Leary,\" he said faintly, \"my mistake.\"\n  \n \n  And he hung up\u2014more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his\nfingers.\n  \n \n  The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.\n  \n \n  Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it\ndidn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.\nBecause five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the\nhard-timers of the Greensleeves.\n  \n \n  His name was Flock.\n  \n \n  He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,\nthought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the\ncrazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the\nface of an agonized man.\n  \n \n  The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"\n  \n \n  Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did\nhappen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that\nactuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison\nrules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the\nGreensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case\nhad to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.\n  \n \n  \"Rest period\" it was called\u2014in the rule book. The inmates had a less\nlovely term for it.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "\nThe conversation between Liam O'Leary and Warden Godfrey Schluckebier reveals that their society heavily relies on specialization to thrive. It is initially said that the direction of evolution is towards specialization, and this also includes mankind. However, humans can create whatever environment they want to specialize in. The warden tells O'Leary that he should not involve himself in the warden's affairs and that he had his own job to do too. He emphasizes that everybody's jobs are important, but it is even more essential to stick to one's own and not pass on another person's occupation. Although O'Leary is upset at how the warden ignores his warnings, Schluckebier reminds him that 'specialization is the goal for civilization,' which means he does not want to worry about O'Leary's job nor should O'Leary worry about his. This goal also reveals how extreme the belief that a specialized society is one of a higher degree. Letting any specialization mix will only result in half-specialists, who fall in the same category as people who cannot specialize and ultimately serve no purpose to the future of humanity. ",
        "Summary_2": "Their conversation reveals the divides and the prejudices at play in the society in which they live in. O'Leary mentions how he thinks it's not right that men of different sections should be mixing together, not even for playing ball. The Warden seems to take a much kinder approach to this outlook. He thinks that while everyone should just stick to their own job, every job is important, and every person is important. The idea of passing is brought up. It is the idea that someone would eventually overcome their social class based on merit. This idea seems both taboo, and ok, as it is the main reason for sectioning in the first place. ",
        "Summary_3": "From the conversation between O\u2019Leary and Warden Godfrey, Liam is discussing how he is worried because 2 different classes of people were interacting in a recreational manner with each other. This demonstrates that in this particular society, this course of action is not supposed to happen. Thus, it can be deduced that in the society they live in, different classes of people are not to mix. In addition, someone else cannot do another person\u2019s job in this society. The goal of their society is specialization, which means each person has a particular service they specialize in and provide. ",
        "Summary_4": "The society is concerned about improving the civilization. It aims towards total specialization with everyone minding their own business in which they are genuinely good. When the trouble comes indeed, turns out the Warden should have listened to Liam. Therefore, this strict accordance to specialization doesn't always make good and when two specializations interfere it may be too late. It shows how the desire to make a perfect civilization so badly makes it full of stupid flaws."

Gripping it like a Scout-ax,\nshe reached for the light cord with her free hand and tugged at it.\n  \n \n  The room was empty.\n  \n \n  \"Testing,\" the voice repeated.\n  \n \n  \"What you're testing,\" Orison said in a firm voice, \"is my patience.\nWho are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Department of Treasury Monitor J-12,\" the male voice said. \"Do you\nhave anything to report, Miss McCall?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you, Monitor?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"That's classified information,\" the voice said. \"Please speak directly\nto your pillow, Miss McCall.\"\n  \n \n  Orison lay down cautiously. \"All right,\" she whispered to her pillow.\n  \n \n  \"Over here,\" the voice instructed her, coming from the unruffled pillow\nbeside her.\n  \n \n  Orison transferred her head to the pillow to her left. \"A radio?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Of a sort,\" Monitor J-12 agreed. \"We have to maintain communications\nsecurity. Have you anything to report?\"\n  \n \n  \"I got the job,\" Orison said. \"Are you ... in that pillow ... all the\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Only at report times. Shall we\nestablish our rendezvous here at eleven-fifteen, Central Standard Time,\nevery day?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it sound so improper,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"I'm far enough away to do you no harm, Miss McCall,\" the monitor said.\n\"Now, tell me what happened at the bank today.\"\n  \n \n  Orison briefed her pillow on the Earmuffs, on her task of reading to a\nmicrophone, and on the generally mimsy tone of the William Howard Taft\nNational Bank and Trust Company. \"That's about it, so far,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Good report,\" J-12 said from the pillow. \"Sounds like you've dropped\ninto a real snakepit, beautiful.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know ... why do you think I'm beautiful?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"Native optimism,\" the voice said. \"Good night.\" J-12 signed off with\na peculiar electronic pop that puzzled Orison for a moment. Then she\nplaced the sound: J-12 had kissed his microphone.\n  \n \n  Orison flung the shoe and the pillow under her bed, and resolved\nto write Washington for permission to make her future reports by\nregistered mail.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  At ten o'clock the next morning, reading page four of the current\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , Orison was interrupted by the click of a pair\nof leather heels. The gentleman whose heels had just slammed together\nwas bowing. And she saw with some gratification that he was not\nwearing earmuffs. \"My name,\" the stranger said, \"is Dink Gerding. I am\nPresident of this bank, and wish at this time to welcome you to our\nlittle family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said. A handsome man, she mused. Twenty-eight?\nSo tall. Could he ever be interested in a girl just five-foot-three?\nMaybe higher heels?\n  \n \n  \"We're pleased with your work, Miss McCall,\" Dink Gerding said. He took\nthe chair to the right of her desk.\n  \n \n  \"It's nothing,\" Orison said, switching off the microphone.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, Miss McCall. Your duties are most important,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Reading papers and fairy-tales into this microphone is nothing any\nreasonably astute sixth-grader couldn't do as well,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be reading silently before long,\" Mr. Gerding said. He smiled,\nas though this explained everything. \"By the way, your official\ndesignation is Confidential Secretary. It's me whose confidences you're\nto keep secret. If I ever need a letter written, may I stop down here\nand dictate it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please do,\" Orison said. This bank president, for all his grace and\npresence, was obviously as kookie as his bank.\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever worked in a bank before, Miss McCall?\" Mr. Gerding\nasked, as though following her train of thought.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" she said. \"Though I've been associated with a rather large\nfinancial organization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You may find some of our methods a little strange, but you'll get used\nto them,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, I'd be most grateful if you'd dispense\nwith calling me 'sir.' My name is Dink. It is ridiculous, but I'd enjoy\nyour using it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink?\" she asked. \"And I suppose you're to call me Orison?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the drill,\" he said. \"One more question, Orison. Dinner this\nevening?\"\n  \n \n  Direct, she thought. Perhaps that's why he's president of a bank, and\nstill so young. \"We've hardly met,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"But we're on a first-name basis already,\" he pointed out. \"Dance?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd love to,\" Orison said, half expecting an orchestra to march,\nplaying, from the elevator.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll pick you up at seven. Windsor Arms, if I remember your\npersonnel form correctly.\" He stood, lean, all bone and muscle,\nand bowed slightly. West Point? Hardly. His manners were European.\nSandhurst, perhaps, or Saint Cyr. Was she supposed to reply with a\ncurtsy? Orison wondered.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  He was a soldier, or had been: the way, when he turned, his shoulders\nstayed square. The crisp clicking of his steps, a military metronome,\nto the elevator. When the door slicked open Orison, staring after Dink,\nsaw that each of the half-dozen men aboard snapped off their hats (but\nnot their earmuffs) and bowed, the earmuffed operator bowing with them.\nSmall bows, true; just head-and-neck. But not to her. To Dink Gerding.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Sue-Ann Bradley is also known as Detainee No. WFA-656R at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. She is a recent prisoner and has not been in prison for as long as many other inmates. Her parents both work in Civil Service. She has an excellent educational background and basically whatever a girl could want. However, she chooses to abandon all of that when she lets herself get tangled in dirty business that leads to her arrest. The main reason for her arrest is for conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. She is also described to be a figger-lover because of her actions. Sue-Ann comes off as defiant and courageous when she first steps forward to confront Sandro and O\u2019Leary to explain her side regarding the offense that Mathias reports her for doing. Inside Block O, she tries to walk bravely across the tanglefoot electronic fields only to fall on her face. Even though Sue-Ann is grateful to the guard for letting her attend to her affairs, she does make an effort to ignore him proudly. Despite this brave exterior that Sue-Ann exhibits, she does have moments of weakness. She begins to weep sincerely once the howling and screaming get worse. Although she initially refuses to let the guards hear her, she is eventually driven crazy by the senseless yelling and begins to weep freely. ",
        "Summary_2": "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young girl, of quite a high status, the idea of which she tries to reject throughout the story. Her parents are civil service, which, while not the highest status, is respectable. She has tried to violate the categorised class laws, by being in love with a person who is below her own class. She has been put in prison for it. She is clearly not used to the gruff nature of the prison system, and doesn't understand the slang that the other inmates use. She is clearly quite emotional, not calling the Captain ``Sir\" out of anger, retching when she sees Flock and Sauer and weeping eventually in her cell. When she is in Block O, she notes to herself that it is a good thing that Sauer and Flock were still fighting against the system. She clearly values freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom to love whoever, freedom from this sectorial way of life. ",
        "Summary_3": "Sue-Ann Bradley is a detainee at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. Captain O\u2019Leary describes her as a beautiful young girl. She is in the institution because of conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. Her parents are of the Civil Service class and she was given a good education. Sue-Ann does not like to show that she is scared or nervous and it is evident that is very prideful from the way she conducts herself throughout the prison. She is not afraid to defend herself. ",
        "Summary_4": "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young and attractive detainee in a correctional institution. She was brought up in a perfect environment and surprisingly got mixed into violating the Categories Class laws. She insists she made mistakes in the institution due to the lack of knowledge about her duties. She is emotional and appears angry with the unjust accusations and on the verge of hysteria. She tries to behave boldly and be careful, but just the sight of some makes her shake from the desire to retch. She appreciates resentment and anger and possesses these features. She is scared and disgusted with animal-like behavior and screams though. She is strong, nevertheless, and manages to behave decently. She even feels gratitude for the smallest things she gets at Block O. "

I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n  \n \n  \"Who?\" I interrupted.\n  \n \n  \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country.

The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n   \n   Alpha\n   \n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n   \n   Beta\n   \n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n  \n \n  \"When any form of life is exposed to these\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household.

The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System.

My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,\n  \n 'Ah, love, let us be true\n To one another! for the world, which seems\n To lie before us like a land of dreams,\n So various, so beautiful, so new,\n Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,\n Nor certitude\u2014'\"\n  \n  \"Wait a minute,\" he interrupted. \"Who sends you these boxes?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how are the notes signed?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're wonderful notes,\" she said. \"So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd\nimagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but how are they signed?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated. \"Never anything but 'Your Lover.'\"\n  \n \n  \"And so when you first saw me, you thought\u2014\" He began, then stopped\nbecause she was blushing.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been getting them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new\nones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how does this\u2014person get these boxes to you out here?

He could still hear the faint\n   \n   chop-chop\n   \n  of the waves.\n  \n \n  And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape\nglimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to\na sudden focus.

        "Summary_1": "To the outside world, the Jug is a symbol of the lack of organization and control in the specialist society. Unlike normal street brawls or bar-room fights within the individual classes, the civilians see the Jug as where all classes end up together. This fact is extremely dangerous, because it goes against the values and goals of a higher civilization that the specialization society tries so hard to maintain. While most of the bonds that people form with one another are in their specialization classes, people from the Jug do not have to uphold this same obligation. There is also fear that once these criminals break out of the Jug, the neatly organized class order will become disrupted, and a riot larger than any prison can handle will occur amongst the people in the outside world. In the story, many already begin to prepare for the riots that will inevitably happen when the criminals break out of the Jug. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Jug is a symbol of anarchy to the outside world. They are the lowest of the low in society. They scare the outside world so much because they break the rules of the civilisation which has been created. The prisoners all live and work together, despite their status in the outside world. It is a forgeign concept to those on the outside, who are forbidden to mingle with people of different classes. The Jug is also a symbol of how quickly you can get in trouble for trying to break the status quo. It is a symbol that is clearly used to incite fear into anyone who thinks of trying to pass as someone from a higher station to acquire a better job, or for two people of different sections who try to have a relationship together. It is a symbol above all of the consequences of not following the rules. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Jug is where all classes are grouped together. Outside of the Jug, the classes are completely separate and by that, they live in their own neighborhoods and perform separate jobs. The Jug represents a threat to the outside world because it breaks the standards that are followed. The outside world has constructed itself to be fit into neat compartmentations of society that separate individuals into different classes. Those classes do not exist in the Jug and could influence and thus threaten the operations of the outside world if the concept were to spread. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Jug is the corrupt sludge on which the whole city-state is based. All classes are cast together in the Jug. Therefore, a riot there affects every class in the city. All the civilians are filled with horror and seek ways for defense. Lots of rockets and helicopters are immediately sent to the prison after this notice of possible riot as it must be prevented by all means. Aircraftswomen are scared knowing how the wipes are towards their kind and rush for weapons. The anxiety of the governor shows the level of danger as he sends such great forces to the prison. To keep the city-state alive there can be no mixing between classes. The riot would break this essential class division. And as we know from the other parts of the text, specialization was the most important thing for people by then. "

        "Summary_1": "The story opens up on a bank robbery. Three men, wearing identical outfits and masks, walk in and threaten the citizens in the bank, raising a weapon. As the men are taking money from behind the counter, a woman, Miss English, makes a run for the door. She is shot at but missed, caught by one of the men at the door, and another citizen, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call for help. The men flee the bank and hop into a stolen car, just missing the incoming police. As the men get away, the car suddenly malfunctions and crashes into another car, and they are eventually caught by the police. Detective Stevenson discusses the incident with Detective Pauling, and he is perplexed by how the tires of the stolen car seemed to melt instantly, and how the words \"The Scorpion\" were branded into the car. The owner of the stolen car, John Hastings, arrives, and he confirms that the words were not on the car before it was stolen. Two days later, the Daily News receives a crank letter, addressed from \"The Scorpion\" and explaining that he fights crime, threatening criminals. The letter was not published. About a month after the robbery, another incident occurs in Brooklyn, where Jerome Higgins murders his wife and injures his sister after spending days in his bedroom. Police and cameramen arrive at his home, where a standoff occurs for an hour before Higgins suddenly throws his rifle and runs outside, his hands burned severely. Stevenson finds the rifle and sees \"The Scorpion\" burned into the side of it. Stevenson goes to Captain Hanks, questioning the similarities between the two events, and Hanks dismisses his conspiracies. The Daily Mail receives another letter, but still does not publish it. On Halloween, two gangs, the Challengers and the Scarlet Raiders, plan a rumble over territory. Judy Canzanetti is a lookout for the Scarlet Raiders, and she is guarding the street when a group of children approach her. Judy warns them to leave, but one of the children goes around her and runs down the street. Suddenly, the police arrive, and Judy warns the gang, but then sees them jumping around and throwing their weapons and jackets. Again, the words \"The Scorpion\" are found on the jackets of both gangs. Stevenson brings this up to Hanks again, but he denies it and tells him to stop bringing the theory up.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins in a bank. It is under control of three bank robbers, who have taken nine other people in the bank hostage. One man escapes out the door, shouting for help. The robbers quickly run outside to meet their getaway driver, where they speed off. They are followed by police. The getaway car reaches ahead until the car crashes, and the police clap handcuffs on the robbers, taking them to the station. \nBack in the station Detective-Sergeant Stevenson discusses with his colleague what happened. The tires of the getaway car seemed to have melted. The car was normal, apart from the words \"the scorpion\", burned in big black letters on the trunk lid. They meet the owner of the stolen car at the station, who tells them that he never put that sign on the car. That was on Wednesday. On Friday, the Daily News is sent a crank letter from someone signed \"the scorpion\" who tells the paper to warn their readers that \"the scorpion fights crime\" and that criminals are not safe.\nJerome Higgins, a man from Brooklyn goes crazy and kills his wife and injures his sister with a gun. Both neighbours and police surround the house after his sister Mrs.Strober escapes the house. inside, Higgins goes ballistic, shooting at random. That is until Higgins runs out of the house, his hands and shoulder having severe burns. He is taken to get his wounds treated, and then to jail. On the gun, it is burned into the wood \"The Scorpion\". \nThe Sergeant and his Captain discuss these cases. Stevenson thinks that they must be connected, but the Captain tells Stevenson to stop looking into this fantasy, as they have nothing in common, and it's a mere coincidence. The Daily News received another letter of warning that was never published. \nIt is Halloween night. The gangs \"The Challengers\" and \"The Scarlet Raiders\" are getting ready for a fight. The two leaders of the gang have agreed to a knife fight over a schoolyard for territory. Judy Canzanetti is sent out by the Scarlet Raiders as a lookout for any kids or cops going by. She sees a group of kids, who she tries to divert, but when one of them escapes and runs in the direction of the fight, she is caught off guard. That is until she hears sirens, and goes to warn the gang. Before she gets there though, all the members of the two gangs jump around, throwing their weapons on the ground and taking off their jackets. It is explained later on by Steavenson that their weapons all of a sudden became freezing cold, as did their jackets, with \"the scorpion\" burned into the backs of them. The captain once again tells Stevenson to let this \"nonsense\" go, and it's nothing more than a coincidence. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with a bank robbery in late June. There are twelve people in the bank when it is robbed. The three robbers, who look like triplets, all wear the same outfits. One man draws a pistol while the other one takes the guard's pistol, Mr. Anderson. The last one takes a black satchel bag and fills it with money. Then, they join the fourth robber in a stolen car while the police chase them. It seems that they will get away, but the tires melt, which gives the police the opportunity to apprehend them. On Wednesday, Detective-Sergeant Stevenson finds it very strange, but Detective-Sergeant Pauling tells him it is common for plans to have these flaws. Stevenson mentions that the car has 'The Scorpion' burned into it just as the owner arrives. John Hastings says that he reported his car as soon as it was stolen. Stevenson is surprised that he would leave his keys in it, but Hastings says it is usually safe for him because he is a wine and liquor salesman. Hastings is angry at the police for melting his tires, but Stevenson says the police had no part in that. Both of them are confused by the writing on the car since it was not there before. On Friday, the Daily News receives a letter from The Scorpion that warns the readers of the paper because it fights crime. However, the letter is ignored and filed into the wastebasket instead. The second incident happens in early August when a Brooklyn man named Jerome Higgins goes berserk after failing a Civil Service exam for the third time. The crime is in Canarsie, in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. Mrs. Higgins and his sister, Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, try to wake him up; Mister Higgins kills his wife and injures his sister with a hunting rifle. He then goes on a rampage, barricading himself in the house and shooting at anything that moves. Policemen, firemen, neighbors, ambulance attendants, and even two cameramen from the mobile unit are present. After one hour, Higgins plans to shoot at the camera, but he suddenly throws his rifle away. He then complains about his hands, which are severely burned, and Stevenson finds the words 'The Scorpion' present again. Precinct Captain Hanks tells him that his idea of an external force fighting crime out there is silly, while the Daily News receives a second letter from The Scorpion. The third case details a Hallowe'en rumble in a schoolyard. Judy Canzanetti is made to stand chicken, and she tells a group of kids in Hallowe'en masks to stay away from the schoolyard. The kid named Eddie dashes down the street, and the cops soon appear after. Stevenson tries to bring up how strange it is for both gangs to have 'The Scorpion' on their jackets when the conflict was a territorial war. Hanks refutes his points and tells him to stop worrying about any Scorpion nonsense.",
        "Summary_4": "A bank is being robbed by three similar looking men. Picking a moment, one of the hostages, Miss English, rushes out, but she is stopped, while another captive, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call the police. The robbers hit Miss English into unconsciousness and run away. Police cars come and go in the wrong way, but surprisingly manage to capture the robbers after all. The stupid mistake of the robbers seems suspicious as the car's tires melted for no reason and the stolen car was very noticeable with \"The Scorpion\" written in the back. When the car owner comes, he is very angry and upset, and he mentions the inscription wasn't there before the robbery. Soon, a letter from \"The Scorpion\" is received by a newspaper, saying that the sender will keep fighting crime. About one month later, a clerk murders his wife from a rifle after going berserk. This man, Mr. Higgins, barricades himself at home and fires outside in defense, while his sister runs to the police and the neighbors call. After an hour of no success in arresting the man, he runs out himself with his hands being terribly burnt. The same detective who led the first case, Stevenson, comes to the scene, and sees an engraving \"The Scorpion\" on the rifle. Higgins' lawyer claims the inscription was put by his client, while the least denies it, which the lawyer uses to proclaim him insane. Stevenson holds on to someone else making those inscriptions while Captain Hanks denies the version. Stevenson keeps posing questions making the case strange, but Hanks tries to close the case with explaining everything as primitively as possible. Hanks orders Stevenson to forget his ideas of someone pretending to be a superhero and even threatens him reminding about a precedent. Another warning letter to the readers comes from \"The Scorpion\" to the newspaper, but it's not printed again. Another story takes place on Halloween, two gangs meet to fight for a school yard with knifes and chains. A fifteen year old girl Judy stands chicken on the corner during the fight and sees a bunch of kids heading home, she says them to go another way, but one kid sees the rumble and rushes there. Suddenly the cops come and the gangs do not hear Judy's warning, everyone is arrested. \"The Scorpion\" appears on the participants' jackets after the fight. Turns out the fight didn't happen as all the metallic weapons and leather jackets suddenly got extremely cold to hold. Hanks again finds an explanation - the kids threw all of these away not tore arrested. He again tells Stevenson to stop with this nonsense from the superhero books. "

They were using it in\na bank holdup.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then why did they do\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the\ncrudely-lettered words, \"The Scorpion\" burned black into the paint of\nthe trunk lid. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"It wasn't there before\nthe car was stolen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not!\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson frowned. \"Now, why in the world did they do that?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suggest,\" said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, \"you ask them that.\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson shook his head. \"It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking\nabout anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us.\" He looked at the\ntrunk lid again. \"It's the nuttiest thing,\" he said thoughtfully....\n  \n \n  That was on Wednesday.\n  \n \n  The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the\n   \n   Daily News\n   \n  brought a crank\nletter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,\nthe address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a\nnewspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.\n  \n \n  The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:\n  \n \n  Dear Mr. Editor:\n  \n \n  The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion\nfights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging\nScorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It\ndidn't rate a line in the paper.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man\nwent berserk.\n  \n \n  It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica\nBay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,\ncomposed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a\nMotor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.\n  \n \n  Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the\nthird time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,\nbrooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.\n  \n \n  As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to\nawaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he\nreally ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then\nallegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.\n  \n \n  Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma\nStodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the\nhouse at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked\nbedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and\n\"stop acting like a child.\" Neighbors reported to the police that they\nheard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, \"Go away! Can't you let a\nman sleep?\"\n  \n \n  At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,\na two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of\nsimilar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted\nfrom his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being\nannoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells\nat them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the\nhand and shoulder.\n  \n \n  Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming\nout the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,\n\"Murder! Murder!\" At this point, neighbors called the police. One\nneighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television\nstations, thereby earning forty dollars in \"news-tips\" rewards.\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was\nimpatient as well. \"All right, Stevenson,\" he said. \"Make it fast, I've\ngot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing\nof yours again.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid it is, Captain,\" said Stevenson. \"Did you see the morning\npaper?\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?\"\n  \n \n  Captain Hanks sighed. \"Stevenson,\" he said wearily, \"are you going to\ntry to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's\nthe problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'\" Stevenson told\nhim. \"One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the\nChallengers.\"\n  \n \n  \"So they changed their name,\" said Hanks.\n  \n \n  \"Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted\nthat much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever\nseeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"A bunch of juvenile delinquents,\" said Hanks in disgust. \"You take\ntheir word?\"\n  \n \n  \"Captain, did you read the article in the paper?\"\n  \n \n  \"I glanced through it.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started\nfighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once\nall the metal they were carrying\u2014knives and tire chains and coins and\nbelt buckles and everything else\u2014got freezing cold, too cold to touch.\nAnd then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to\npull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later\ncollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been\nbranded 'The Scorpion.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, let\n   \n   me\n   \n  tell\n   \n   you\n   \n  something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard\nthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they\nthrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been\npart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before\nthey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed\nup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it\nbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the\nneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not\nbothering anybody.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what happened. And all this talk about\nfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec\npunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to\nworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid\ngangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or\nyou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.\nNow, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n<doc-sep>You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political\nconnections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As\nCaptain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both\nmore imaginative than most\u2014\"You gotta be able to second-guess the\nsmart boys\"\u2014and to be a complete realist\u2014\"You gotta have both feet\non the ground.\" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was\nbest not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.\n  \n \n  The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.\n\"Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure,\" admitted Stevenson. \"But we've got these two things.\nFirst, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for\nno reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.\nThen, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle\nall of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to\nprove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He says he put that on there himself,\" said the captain.\n  \n \n  Stevenson shook his head. \"His\n   \n   lawyer\n   \n  says he put it on there.\nHiggins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's\ncase. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.\"\n  \n \n  \"He put it on there himself, Stevenson,\" said the captain with weary\npatience. \"What are you trying to prove?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And\nwhat about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were defective,\" said Hanks promptly.\n  \n \n  \"All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the\ntrunk?\"\n  \n \n  \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain. \"Kids put it on before the car\nwas stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?\nWhat do\n   \n   they\n   \n  say?\"\n  \n \n  \"They say they didn't do it,\" said Stevenson. \"And they say they never\nsaw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  The captain shook his head. \"I don't get it,\" he admitted. \"What are\nyou trying to prove?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess,\" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, \"I\nguess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made\nthat rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are\nyou trying to hand me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know,\" insisted Stevenson, \"is what I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"And all\n   \n   I\n   \n  know,\" the captain told him, \"is Higgins put that name on\nhis rifle himself. He says so.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what made it so hot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do\nyou\n   \n   think\n   \n  made it hot?\"\n  \n \n  \"All of a sudden?\"\n  \n \n  \"He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.\"\n  \n \n  \"How come the same name showed up each time, then?\" Stevenson asked\ndesperately.\n  \n \n  \"How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these\nthings happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they\nwrite 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens\nall the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?\"\n  \n \n  \"But there's no explanation\u2014\" started Stevenson.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just\n   \n   gave\n   \n  you the\nexplanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty\nidea\u2014like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there\nwas a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned\nrefrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting\nall upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.\nRemember?\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n \n  \"Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,\" the captain advised him.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson....\n  \n \n  The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a\ncrank letter to the\n   \n   Daily News\n   \n  :\n  \n \n  Dear Mr. Editor,\n  \n \n  You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could\nnot escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is\nsafe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had\nseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the\nsame place, and forgotten.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around\nfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up\ncarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on\nyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a\nJD.\n  \n \n  The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances\non two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and\nthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides\nclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys\nfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that\nhad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and\ndetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.\n  \n \n  The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.\nThe weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no\npistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner\nwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both\nentrances.\n  \n \n  The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate\nclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play\nchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of\nthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might\ncome wandering through.\n  \n \n  Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen\nyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,\ngum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the\nScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to\nher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.\n  \n \n  Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were\ndark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,\nparticularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone\npole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet\nRaider jacket and waited.\n  \n \n  At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The\nrumble had started.\n  \n \n  At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the\nstreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them\ncarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks\non.\n  \n \n  They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey,\nyou kids. Take off.\"\n  \n \n  One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\"\n  \n \n  \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask.\n  \n \n  \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "In all three incidents that take place in the story, the criminals were stopped and caught by the police. They all seemed to be mysteriously burned in one way or another: the tires on the car melted off, Higgins' hands were burned by the rifle, and the jackets and weapons of the gang members seemed to have the same effect. Additionally, all three events were tagged by \"The Scorpion\": the words were branded on the car, the rifle, and the jackets.",
        "Summary_2": "There is a very odd pattern that Stevenson notices in the crimes that makes him suspicious. In all the crimes mentioned in the story, there has been the words \"The Scorpion\" left behind on some piece of evidence relating to the crime by an unknown source. There is also the connection of heat in all three cases. In the bank robbery case, the tires melt without explanation, and \"the scorpion\" is burned onto the outside of the car. \nIn the murder case, the gun which Mr Higgins holds burns his hands and his shoulder, and the words are left burned into the wooden part of the gun. \nIn the incident involving the two gangs, their weapons and jackets become increasingly cold, up to the point where they can no longer touch them. The words \"the scorpion\" and imprinted on the back of their jackets. ",
        "Summary_3": "Stevenson notices that shortly after all of the criminals are arrested, the mark of \u2018The Scorpion\u2019 is left behind. In the bank robbery, the writing is burned into the lid of the car. In the Brooklyn rampage incident, it is burned onto the wood stock of Mister Higgin\u2019s hunting rifle. In the schoolyard incident, the word is written on the back of all the jackets of the two gangs. These patterns make him suspicious because although there is no evidence of any external interference, the word appears whenever the criminals\u2019 plans have been thwarted and the police have arrived. The words also do not seem to be written by the criminals themselves either. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Each crime is very different - a bank robbery, a domestic murder and a kids gangs fight. Nevertheless, they bare linked with an inscription \"The Scorpion\" appearing on some attributes and weird things preventing the crimes. First, well-organized robbers make a stupid mistake of picking a noticeable car and their tires burn for no cause, then a rifle gets hot all of a sudden and burns the hands holding it. In the end, weapons and jackets become impossible to hold as they are extremely cold. Thus, the thee crimes are stopped. And the same inscription is told by everyone not to have been there before. "

        "Article": "On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures.

Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When his\nship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been\nstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\nInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how\nwe operate?\"\n  \n \n  He told her the tales he'd heard.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n",

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between Stevenson and Hanks in \"Call Him Nemesis\"?",
        "Article": "Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was\nimpatient as well. \"All right, Stevenson,\" he said. \"Make it fast, I've\ngot a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing\nof yours again.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid it is, Captain,\" said Stevenson. \"Did you see the morning\npaper?\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?\"\n  \n \n  Captain Hanks sighed. \"Stevenson,\" he said wearily, \"are you going to\ntry to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's\nthe problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'\" Stevenson told\nhim. \"One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the\nChallengers.\"\n  \n \n  \"So they changed their name,\" said Hanks.\n  \n \n  \"Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted\nthat much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever\nseeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"A bunch of juvenile delinquents,\" said Hanks in disgust. \"You take\ntheir word?\"\n  \n \n  \"Captain, did you read the article in the paper?\"\n  \n \n  \"I glanced through it.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started\nfighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once\nall the metal they were carrying\u2014knives and tire chains and coins and\nbelt buckles and everything else\u2014got freezing cold, too cold to touch.\nAnd then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to\npull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later\ncollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been\nbranded 'The Scorpion.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, let\n   \n   me\n   \n  tell\n   \n   you\n   \n  something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard\nthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they\nthrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been\npart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before\nthey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed\nup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it\nbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the\nneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not\nbothering anybody.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what happened. And all this talk about\nfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec\npunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to\nworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid\ngangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or\nyou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.\nNow, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n<doc-sep>You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political\nconnections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As\nCaptain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both\nmore imaginative than most\u2014\"You gotta be able to second-guess the\nsmart boys\"\u2014and to be a complete realist\u2014\"You gotta have both feet\non the ground.\" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was\nbest not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.\n  \n \n  The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.\n\"Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure,\" admitted Stevenson. \"But we've got these two things.\nFirst, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for\nno reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.\nThen, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle\nall of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to\nprove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He says he put that on there himself,\" said the captain.\n  \n \n  Stevenson shook his head. \"His\n   \n   lawyer\n   \n  says he put it on there.\nHiggins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's\ncase. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.\"\n  \n \n  \"He put it on there himself, Stevenson,\" said the captain with weary\npatience. \"What are you trying to prove?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And\nwhat about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were defective,\" said Hanks promptly.\n  \n \n  \"All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the\ntrunk?\"\n  \n \n  \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain. \"Kids put it on before the car\nwas stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?\nWhat do\n   \n   they\n   \n  say?\"\n  \n \n  \"They say they didn't do it,\" said Stevenson. \"And they say they never\nsaw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  The captain shook his head. \"I don't get it,\" he admitted. \"What are\nyou trying to prove?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess,\" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, \"I\nguess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made\nthat rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are\nyou trying to hand me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know,\" insisted Stevenson, \"is what I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"And all\n   \n   I\n   \n  know,\" the captain told him, \"is Higgins put that name on\nhis rifle himself. He says so.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what made it so hot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do\nyou\n   \n   think\n   \n  made it hot?\"\n  \n \n  \"All of a sudden?\"\n  \n \n  \"He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.\"\n  \n \n  \"How come the same name showed up each time, then?\" Stevenson asked\ndesperately.\n  \n \n  \"How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these\nthings happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they\nwrite 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens\nall the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?\"\n  \n \n  \"But there's no explanation\u2014\" started Stevenson.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just\n   \n   gave\n   \n  you the\nexplanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty\nidea\u2014like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there\nwas a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned\nrefrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting\nall upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.\nRemember?\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n \n  \"Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,\" the captain advised him.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson....\n  \n \n  The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a\ncrank letter to the\n   \n   Daily News\n   \n  :\n  \n \n  Dear Mr. Editor,\n  \n \n  You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could\nnot escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is\nsafe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had\nseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the\nsame place, and forgotten.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around\nfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up\ncarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on\nyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a\nJD.\n  \n \n  The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances\non two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and\nthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides\nclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys\nfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that\nhad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and\ndetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.\n  \n \n  The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.\nThe weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no\npistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner\nwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both\nentrances.\n  \n \n  The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate\nclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play\nchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of\nthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might\ncome wandering through.\n  \n \n  Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen\nyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,\ngum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the\nScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to\nher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.\n  \n \n  Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were\ndark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,\nparticularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone\npole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet\nRaider jacket and waited.\n  \n \n  At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The\nrumble had started.\n  \n \n  At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the\nstreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them\ncarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks\non.\n  \n \n  They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey,\nyou kids. Take off.\"\n  \n \n  One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\"\n  \n \n  \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask.\n  \n \n  \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>On the way around, Stevenson said, \"I believe you reported the car\nstolen almost immediately after it happened.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" said Hastings. \"I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm\na wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car\nwas gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"You left the keys in it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, why not?\" demanded Hastings belligerently. \"If I'm making just\na quick stop\u2014I never spend more than five minutes with any one\ncustomer\u2014I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"The car was stolen,\" Stevenson reminded him.\n  \n \n  Hastings grumbled and glared. \"It's always been perfectly safe up till\nnow.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. In here.\"\n  \n \n  Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. \"It's ruined!\"\nhe cried. \"What did you do to the tires?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.\"\n  \n \n  Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. \"Look at that!\nThere's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What\ndid you use, incendiary bullets?\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson shook his head. \"No, sir. When that happened they were two\nblocks away from the nearest policeman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hmph.\" Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,\n\"What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of\n   \n   kids\n   \n  had stolen the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a bunch of kids,\" Stevenson told him. \"It was four\nprofessional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in\na bank holdup.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then why did they do\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the\ncrudely-lettered words, \"The Scorpion\" burned black into the paint of\nthe trunk lid. \"I really don't know,\" he said. \"It wasn't there before\nthe car was stolen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not!\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson frowned. \"Now, why in the world did they do that?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suggest,\" said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, \"you ask them that.\"\n  \n \n  Stevenson shook his head. \"It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking\nabout anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us.\" He looked at the\ntrunk lid again. \"It's the nuttiest thing,\" he said thoughtfully....\n  \n \n  That was on Wednesday.\n  \n \n  The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the\n   \n   Daily News\n   \n  brought a crank\nletter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,\nthe address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a\nnewspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.\n  \n \n  The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:\n  \n \n  Dear Mr. Editor:\n  \n \n  The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion\nfights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging\nScorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It\ndidn't rate a line in the paper.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man\nwent berserk.\n  \n \n  It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica\nBay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,\ncomposed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a\nMotor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.\n  \n \n  Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the\nthird time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,\nbrooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.\n  \n \n  As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to\nawaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he\nreally ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then\nallegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.\n  \n \n  Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma\nStodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the\nhouse at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked\nbedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and\n\"stop acting like a child.\" Neighbors reported to the police that they\nheard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, \"Go away! Can't you let a\nman sleep?\"\n  \n \n  At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,\na two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of\nsimilar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted\nfrom his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being\nannoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells\nat them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the\nhand and shoulder.\n  \n \n  Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming\nout the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,\n\"Murder! Murder!\" At this point, neighbors called the police. One\nneighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television\nstations, thereby earning forty dollars in \"news-tips\" rewards.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Stevenson and Hanks have a tense relationship. Though they are both in high positions at the police precinct, Hanks is the Captain, Stevenson's superior. This power dynamic is evident throughout the story, particularly when Stevenson tries to bring up his theories and suspicions about The Scorpion. Instead of hearing him out, Hanks refuses to listen, becoming increasingly frustrated and calling Stevenson's thoughts childlike nonsense. Despite this, Stevenson is still determined to get his idea through to Hanks.",

        "Summary_3": "Hanks is the Precinct Captain, while Stevenson works under him as a Detective-Sergeant. Hanks and Stevenson share a good working relationship; however, Hank gets annoyed whenever Stevenson brings up his theories about \u201cThe Scorpion\u201d and thinks of them as nonsense. He refutes every point realistically, saying that Higgins burned the words onto the rifle himself. When Stevenson brings up the earlier robbery incident, Hanks refuses to accept those observations and says Stevenson\u2019s points are similar to that of a comic book. During the schoolyard incident, Hank is extremely annoyed at Stevenson trying to connect more points to \u2018The Scorpion\u2019 and tells him that the children just had a silly brawl. He also warns Stevenson to stop thinking about these foolish ideas and return to doing his job in the precinct. \n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Stevenson and Hanks are both important people in the police with years of experience. They have completely different views on the described crimes. Stevenson wants to check every possibility, something doesn't adds up for him and he wants to keep investigating. He is determined to find out the truth and he is passionate about it, he is also emotional in proving his point and thinks a lot about the cases. Hanks simply wants to close the cases as fast as possible and Stevenson's guesses irritate him. He is not interested in other possibilities and has rather realistic explanations. He uses his position and authority to threaten Stevenson into shutting up and stopping irritated Hanks."

And they just got going when all at once\nall the metal they were carrying\u2014knives and tire chains and coins and\nbelt buckles and everything else\u2014got freezing cold, too cold to touch.\nAnd then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to\npull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later\ncollected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been\nbranded 'The Scorpion.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, let\n   \n   me\n   \n  tell\n   \n   you\n   \n  something,\" said Hanks severely. \"They heard\nthe police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they\nthrew their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been\npart of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before\nthey could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed\nup a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it\nbut weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the\nneighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not\nbothering anybody.\n   \n   That's\n   \n  what happened. And all this talk about\nfreezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec\npunk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to\nworrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid\ngangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or\nyou're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.\nNow, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room. The\ncurtain rose.\n  \n<doc-sep>Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready\nfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the\ndarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over\nthat curving surface for identifying features.\n  \n \n  While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly\nseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage\nkick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an\nunexpected voice.\n  \n \n  \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think\nyou are?\"\n  \n \n  Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to\nfumble for it. \"Who do you think\n   \n   you\n   \n  are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls\n   \n   are\n   \n  there in this raiding\nparty?\"\n  \n \n  His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!\n  \n \n  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused\nsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever\n   \n   that\n   \n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n  \n \n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n   \n   I\n   \n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n  \n \n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n  \n \n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n  \n \n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n  \n \n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself....\n  \n",

Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches?\nOur reputations don't go outside our own fields,\" Mitchell said. \"But\nnow Macklin\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein\nin the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word\n\"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether\nhis Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been\nable to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but\nlooked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The\ngovernment took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the\nIdeal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.\n  \n \n  For the past seven years Macklin\u2014who\n   \n   was\n   \n  the Advanced Studies\nDepartment of Firestone University\u2014had been involved in devising a\nfaster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the\nnearer stars.

It was\nknown that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of\nthe headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several\nweeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen\naround the campus.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the\nlaboratory in the biology building.

He\nlooked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell\nsuspected that that was his intention.\n  \n \n  He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. \"Good of you to ask me over,\nSteven.\"\n  \n \n  Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. \"How have you been,\nHarold?\"\n  \n \n  Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. \"Fine, thank you,\ndoctor.\"\n  \n \n  Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. \"Now\nwhat's this about you wanting my help on something?

        "Summary_1": "Ferris and Mitchell discuss the struggles they are experiencing with their research. They are eager to test their new research and want the test subject to be Elliot Macklin, a well-known and attractive scientist with a reputation akin to Albert Einstein. Macklin experiences migraines and the two believe that their injection shot could cure them. The two want Macklin to participate because it could ensure that their research will have strong financial support.\n\nMacklin soon enters their laboratory and begins to ask about what they\u2019re looking to do with their research. Ferris and Mitchell discuss their theory with Macklin and how their supposed cure works. They mention to Macklin, to his dismay, that it has only been tested on animals. Macklin is skeptical and considers the injection too risky and initially does not agree to take the treatment. \n\nMacklin begins to start experiencing a migraine. As he suffers through a migraine, Ferris and Mitchell use the opportunity to try again to convince him to participate in the research. They further emphasize the very minimal potential risk. Macklin finally agrees to take the injection due to the immense pain he is experiencing. \n\nLater on, Mitchell is upset with Ferris for sharing their unverified results with the press. Ferris exclaims to Mitchell that the experiment with Macklin was a success and that he should not be concerned. The phone rings and Ferris answers it but quickly passes it to Mitchell. Macklin\u2019s wife is on the phone accusing them of giving her husband heroin as Macklin appears to be in a trance. The doctors are concerned by the news and decide to check on the test animals. They do not find anything of concern with the test animals and go to Macklin\u2019s house. Ferris does not seem worried to Mitchell as they wait to be let into the house. When they enter the house, an army Colonel meets them and expresses his unhappiness with their actions. \n\nAs the group heads into the living room, they greet an army physician that tells them that medically there is nothing wrong with Macklin\u2019s health the only difference is that Macklin is no longer a mathematical genius. The three go into the hallway and discuss how the experiment most likely went wrong. The Colonel becomes upset because Macklin was very important to many missions because of his invaluable research. Mitchell suddenly exclaims that he thinks that Macklin can be cured. \n\nHowever, Macklin overhears the possibility of a cure and protests receiving the treatment. The Colonel is upset at Macklin\u2019s reaction and tries to convince Macklin\u2019s wife to force him to be cured. Macklin\u2019s wife does not wish to go against her husband\u2019s wishes. They leave the house without convincing Macklin or his wife. Later on, Mitchell wakes up and calls Macklin. Mitchell attempts to get Macklin to trust him and goes about luring Macklin back to the laboratory by saying that he can help with the new types of worries that Macklin experiences. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Ferris are preparing to test out their new medical breakthrough on world renowned scientist, Dr. Macklin. Their new injection that they have discovered will potentially cure Macklin of his incessant migraines, which plague the genius' daily life. Macklin is famed for being at the forefront of the research team that is almost finished developing a faster than light drive, to help the US army reach Pluto. The only thing in the way of the completion of this project could be Macklin's headaches. Mitchell and Ferris ask Macklin if he would like to be the trial patient for their new antidote, which they only have funding to test out on one person. The antidote consists of a virus that is injected into a specific spot in the brain, blocking off oxygen from entering, curing the patient of any headaches. After walking Macklin through the science behind it and Macklin signing some waivers, they deliver the treatment to him. \nThe next day, Ferris gives the story of their success with the Doctor to the newspapers, that is until they get a call form Macklin's wife. She tells him that her husband seems to be high on a form of heroin. To this the two scientists protest, but then go to check on their previous animal test subjects to see their state. All the animals tested appear fine, yet subdued. They decide to go and check up on Macklin. \nThey arrive at his house to meet a colonel at the door, who invites them into the living room, where Macklin is sitting. He has just been evaluated by the doctor, and it turns out that the vaccine has reduced his brain capacity, to the point where he is now a \"moron\". The oxygen that the brain has been denied has made Macklin stupid, almost childlike. The two scientists propose they can fix this quite easily, and they just need to reverse the treatment they gave him, which would return him to his original state. Both Macklin and his wife refuse this. Macklin wants to live a life without pain, and the thoughts about the universe that would keep him up worrying, late at night. His wife tells the men that she doesn't want to go against her husband's wishes, and if the US government wants to take the pair to court over it, so that Macklin might regain full consciousness and continue with his work on the Pluto project, the court would side in her and her husband's favour. \nThe men leave, defeated. That is until Mitchell wakes up in the middle of the night, and calls Macklin, convincing him that it's in his best interest to come to his lab, so that he might make him better. The colonel has given his wife a sedative, so she won't wake up. Macklin leaves to unknowingly go to have his treatment reversed. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with Steven Mitchell and Harold Ferris arguing over the candidate that they should test their discovery on. While Ferris suggests Mitchell to be the candidate, Mitchell points out that it wouldn\u2019t be ethical. He suggests that Elliot Macklin, the late Albert Einstein, has more reputation and his migraine is well known. He is the perfect candidate they have. After a knock on the door, Mitchell and Ferris invite Macklin inside. They introduce the injection and claim that his headache can be cured forever with this one simple injection. Macklin notices that they have not yet tested this on a human being, but they assert that it worked fine on rats and chimps. They explain their situation to Macklin, which is a lack of time and money. They have the resources to cure one person. However, Macklin is still suspicious of the injection. Mitchell and Ferris assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low enough blood pressure to stop the heart. Along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject. \n\nMacklin\u2019s wife calls and blames them for giving her husband heroin. Being confused, Mitchell and Ferris look at the test animals and realize that the ones with injections are much more calmer and have less energy. They go to see Macklin. Macklin has become the healthiest, happiest person, but he also becomes a moron, namely not very intelligent. After Mitchell explains that he has the antitoxin to fix him, Carson demands them to give it to Macklin. However, Macklin refuses. He used to be worried all the time, but now he is peaceful. Since he is legally responsible, he can definitely refuse the antitoxin. Thus, they go to Mrs. Macklin, hoping that she will be able to persuade Macklin to take the antitoxin. She also refuses. Later, Mitchell calls Macklin pointing out that he is still doing a lot of thinking. Mitchell tells him that he can get rid of them if he wants. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ferris and Mitchell are two biologists that are in the process of developing a cure to the common headache. They want to test their cure on Elliot Macklin, a well-known genius mathematician who suffered from a stroke and is victim to periodic migraines. Macklin arrives, and the two inform him of their plan. They want to create a cure to the headache using an injection of a virus that attacks pituitrin, which causes migraines. They have had no confirmation of success of their cure on humans, only animals, so there is uncertainty with their experiment. Macklin initially tells them that there is too much of a risk, and that too many people rely on him for him to take the risk. However, after some consideration, Macklin agrees to take the injection. Later on, Mitchell scolds Ferris after learning that he had released the story to the press, despite the results not being confirmed yet. They then receive a call from Macklin's wife, hsyterically accusing them of giving Macklin narcotics and claiming that he has been put under a trance. Ferris and Mitchell visit Macklin, where they meet a team of Army doctors and officials, and find Macklin to be in a mellow, relaxed state. The army doctor claims that Macklin is happy and healthy, but that the injection has caused him to become dumber due to a miscalculation. Ferris and Mitchell suggest fixing the issue by wiping out the virus, but Macklin refuses, not wanting to return to his previous state. They ask Mrs. Macklin, who wants to support her husband's best interests. The two suspect that she is jealous of Macklin's genius and wants to keep him subdued in his current condition. One night, Mitchell wakes and calls Macklin, asking him to come to his lab to fix him. "

He was the man people thought of when the word\n\"mathematician\" or even \"scientist\" was mentioned. No one knew whether\nhis Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been\nable to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but\nlooked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The\ngovernment took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the\nIdeal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.\n  \n \n  For the past seven years Macklin\u2014who\n   \n   was\n   \n  the Advanced Studies\nDepartment of Firestone University\u2014had been involved in devising a\nfaster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the\nnearer stars.

It was\nknown that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of\nthe headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several\nweeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen\naround the campus.\n  \n<doc-sep>I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't\nsay anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh\npitcher of\n   \n   thil\n   \n  on the table. Then I cleared my throat.\n  \n \n  \"What exactly did you have in mind, Mr. Beamish?\"\n  \n \n  Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. \"I have\nindependent means, gentlemen. It has always been my desire to lighten\nthe burden of life for those less fortunate....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got red around the ears. \"Just a minute,\" he murmured, and\nstarted to get up. I kicked him under the table.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.\"\n  \n \n  He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish\nignored him. He went on, quietly,\n  \n \n  \"I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most\nvaluable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of\ntoil and boredom....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"Sure, sure.

I propose to\nremedy that. I propose to charter your circus, Mister Shannon, to make\na tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt.\"\n  \n \n  Bucky had relaxed. His grey-green eyes began to gleam. He started to\nspeak, and I kicked him again.\n  \n \n  \"That would be expensive, Mister Beamish,\" I said. \"We'd have to cancel\nseveral engagements....\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me. I was lying, and he knew it. But he said,\n  \n \n  \"I quite understand that. I would be prepared....\"\n  \n \n  The curtains were yanked back suddenly. Beamish shut up. Bucky and I\nglared at the head and shoulders poking in between the drapes.\n  \n \n  It was Gow, our zoo-man\u2014a big, ugly son-of-a-gun from a Terran\ncolony on Mercury. I was there once. Gow looks a lot like the\nscenery\u2014scowling, unapproachable, and tough. His hands, holding the\ncurtains apart, had thick black hair on them and were not much larger\nthan the hams of a Venusian swamp-rhino.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Boss, Gertrude's actin' up again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude be blowed,\" growled Bucky. \"Can't you see I'm busy?\"\n  \n \n  Gow's black eyes were unpleasant. \"I'm tellin' you, Boss, Gertrude\nain't happy. She ain't had the right food. If something....\"\n  \n \n  I said, \"That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to\nfit me for a coffin. \"Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome,\nsee? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot\nship'll hold her.\"\n  \n \n  He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned. Beamish\ncleared his throat and said, rather stiffly,\n  \n \n  \"Gertrude?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. She's kind of temperamental.\" Bucky took a quick drink. I\nfinished for him.\n  \n \n  \"She's the star attraction of our show, Mr. Beamish. A real blue-swamp\nVenusian\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt\nBrothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.\"\n  \n \n  She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be\na little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she\nwouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking\ncircus than even I could stand.\n  \n \n  Beamish looked impressed. \"A\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  . Well, well! The mystery\nsurrounding the origin and species of the\n   \n   cansin\n   \n  is a fascinating\nsubject. The extreme rarity of the animal....\"\n  \n \n  We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, \"We'd have to have\nat least a hundred U.C.'s.\"\n  \n \n  It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker.\nBeamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a\nsecond I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my\nstomach jumped like it was shot. Beamish smiled sweetly.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not much of a bargainer. One hundred Universal Credits will be\nagreeable to me.\" He dragged out a roll as big as my two fists, peeled\noff half a dozen credit slips, and laid them on the table.\n  \n \n  \"By way of a retainer, gentleman. My attorney and I will call on you in\nthe morning with a contract and itinerary. Good night.\"\n  \n \n  We said good night, trying not to drool. Beamish went away. Bucky made\ngrab for the money, but I beat him to it.\n  \n \n  \"Scram,\" I said. \"There are guys waiting for this. Big guys with clubs.\nHere.\" I gave him a small-denomination slip I'd been holding out. \"We\ncan get lushed enough on this.\"\n  \n \n  Shannon has a good vocabulary. He used it. When he got his breath back\nhe said suddenly,\n  \n \n  \"Beamish is pulling some kind of a game.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\"\n  \n \n  \"It may be crooked.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. And he may be screwball and on the level. For Pete's sake!\" I\nyelled. \"You want to sit here till we all dry up and blow away?\"\n  \n \n  Shannon looked at me, kind of funny. He looked at the bulge in my tunic\nwhere the roll was. He raked back his thick light hair.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I hope there'll be enough left to bribe the jury.\" He\npoked his head outside. \"Hey, boy!

Once\nhe's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and\nFerris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin\nto sanity.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner,\" she said.\n  \n \n  The colonel looked smug. \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is\ninvolved.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too.

Mitchell led\nhim back into the hall.\n  \n \n  \"I'm no psychiatrist,\" Mitchell said, \"but I think she wants Macklin\nstupid. Prefers it that way. She's always dominated his personal life,\nand now she can dominate him completely.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is she? A monster?\" the Army officer muttered.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Mitchell said. \"She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous\nof her husband's genius.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" Carson said. \"I don't know.

He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.\n  \n \n  After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.\n  \n \n  \"Hello?\" Elliot Macklin said.\n  \n \n  Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the\nphone instead of his wife.\n  \n \n  \"Can you speak freely, doctor?\" Mitchell asked.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" the mathematician said. \"I can talk fine.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean, are you alone?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she's asleep. That Army\ndoctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn't let him give\nme anything, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good boy,\" the biologist said. \"Listen, doctor\u2014Elliot\u2014El, old son.\nI'm not against you like all the others. I don't want to make you go\nback to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me,\ndon't you?\"\n  \n \n  There was a slight hesitation.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Macklin said, \"if you say so. Why shouldn't I believe you?\"\n  \n \n  \"But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second if\nI could have some reason for not telling you the truth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" Macklin said humbly.\n  \n \n  \"You've found yourself worrying\u2014thinking\u2014about a lot of other\nproblems since we left you, haven't you? Maybe not the same kind of\nscientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn't used to\nhave time to think about.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now, you know it's so. But how would you like to get rid of those\nworries just as you got rid of the others?\" Mitchell asked.\n  \n \n  \"I guess I'd like that,\" the mathematician replied.\n  \n \n  \"Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it's at, don't\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I\u2014yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won't try to put me\nback where I was instead of helping me more?\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so. But I don't guess I can come anyway. The Army is\nwatching me pretty close.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's alright,\" Mitchell said quickly. \"You can bring along Colonel\nCarson.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he won't like you fixing me up more.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he can't stop me!

Biology isn't my field, you know.\"\n  \n \n  Mitchell moved around the desk casually. \"Actually, Doctor, we haven't\nthe right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be an\nelement of risk.\"\n  \n \n  The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. \"Now you\nhave me intrigued. What is it all about?\"\n  \n \n  \"Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches,\" Mitchell said.\n  \n \n  Macklin nodded. \"That's right, Steven. Migraine.\"\n  \n \n  \"That must be terrible,\" Ferris said. \"All your fine reputation and\nlavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearing\nagony begins, can it?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Harold, it isn't,\" Macklin admitted. \"What does your project have\nto do with my headaches?\"\n  \n \n  \"Doctor,\" Mitchell said, \"what would you say the most common complaint\nof man is?\"\n  \n \n  \"I would have said the common cold,\" Macklin replied, \"but I suppose\nfrom what you have said you mean headaches.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Macklin overhears the possibility of receiving a cure to return him back to his previous state before the injection, he protests that he does not want to receive a cure. He does not want to reverse the injection because he remembers how awful the migraines were and refuses to return back to his original state where he has to experience them. He recollects how he was always worrying back then. He is perfectly content with living in a peaceful existence as he has all the money he could want and an attractive wife. \n\nThe Colonel is shocked at Macklin\u2019s revelation and is upset when he realizes he cannot force Macklin to be cured. The Colonel, Ferris, and Mitchell go to Macklin\u2019s wife to try to convince her to get him to be cured. The Colonel is desperate as he wants to use Macklin\u2019s intelligence since it is such a great advantage for the country. \n\nMacklin\u2019s wife supports her husband\u2019s decision because she recognizes the pain and suffering Macklin has experienced. She is glad that he can be peaceful and happy, even if he is childish. \n\nFerris seems unphased and is overall happy to celebrate that the injection did work to cure headaches. Mitchell still wants to attempt to convince Macklin to take the cure. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Each character in the story reacts differently to Macklin's choice to go through with Ferris and Mitchell's cure for migraines. Macklin himself is thrilled with the outcome. He is happy he no longer has the worries of his day to day life that he used to have. Now he can just lead a happy, healthy life with his wife. His wife feels the same way, but for more complicated reasons. She is addicted to controlling her husband, and she sees this as an opportunity to do this completely now, as he has the wits of a child. The colonel is enraged by the fact that the virus has turned Macklin's brain to mush. Macklin is the US government's biggest asset, and he fears what they will do if Macklin doesn't go back to the way he was. Mitchell is remorseful for what the virus has done to Macklin, and goes about finding a way to convince Macklin to reverse the effects. Ferris, while completely on board with the idea of returning Macklin to normal, is happy that the experiment was not a complete failure. ",
        "Summary_3": "Macklin first reacted with a surprise. He take the pipe out from his mouth and is quite delight that he can stop taking the gynergen. However, after hearing that it has not been tested on humans, he believes that there are too much risk involved and refuses to take the injection. After they assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low blood pressure to the point that the heart stops and along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject, immediately. Later Mrs. Macklin calls and blames them for giving his husband heroin, and orders them to make him better. But later, she does not want to go against Macklin\u2019s wish of staying in the current state. Carson has always wanted Macklin to become normal again since the Army still need his intelligence. However, there is nothing he can do since Macklin is still in a legally responsible state.  ",
        "Summary_4": "Macklin is initially hesitant about receiving the cure, but eventually agrees to it out of desperation for his migraines to end. However, the rest of the people around him are not as receptive, especially once the side effects settle in causing Macklin to become less intelligent. Macklin's wife is in distress, convinced that Ferris and Mitchell have given him narcotics. The Army officers and doctors do not approve of the injection either, holding the two scientists responsible for any potential harm done to Macklin and demanding that they reverse it immediately. However, Macklin does not mind the effects of the cure, and prefers it to his old experiences. "

His suit of\nhound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his\njacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious\nbank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really\nswing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you\ncome on real cool in the secretary-bit.\"\n  \n \n  \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from\nstaring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair of\nfurry green earmuffs. It was not cold.\n  \n \n  Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color\nbread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Beg pardon?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and\ndown on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.\n  \n \n  \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said.\n  \n \n  \"You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n\"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week.

I wanna tell\nyou, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around\nthis tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of\nelevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\nto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\nthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\nMr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n\"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\nand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron\nCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,\nnow that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n  \n \n  The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\nhold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\na microphone.

Okay?\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a\nsecretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me\nwith the Bank's operation?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that\nthere paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to\nask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,\ncoffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like.

        "Summary_1": "Orison McCall is applying for a job at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. She is a government spy who has been selected from the Treasury Department to work at the bank. The man who she meets for the job is Mr. Wanji, the First Vice President. He dresses strangely compared to the regular banker. Mr. Wanji also speaks to Orison in strange slang and leaves her with the job of reading newspapers into a microphone. She takes her lunch break at noon, eats a tuna salad on whole-wheat, and returns to reading at her desk until five. Orison gets the job and notes that the bank is very bizarre. All of the workers wear earmuffs, and her only task is to read into a microphone. After her dinner, she goes home and waits to receive a call from Washington. At eleven-thirty, she receives a call from Monitor J-12 from the Department of Treasury. He asks Orison for a report but flirts with her slightly by calling her beautiful and kissing the microphone. The next morning, the bank President Dink Gerding personally welcomes her. She notes that he is as crazy as the rest of the bank, and he asks her out for dinner even though they have just met. Once Orison begins reading a copy of yesterday\u2019s Congressional Record, Auga Vingt silently comes and introduces herself. She threatens Orison to stay away from Dink, to which Orison agrees and tells her to leave. Then, Kraft Gerding introduces himself to her, and she threatens to quit because of how crazy this bank is. Orison then receives a call from Wanji, and he tells her to tell Dink that escudo green is pale. Although she is banned from taking the elevator to the upper floor, she takes the stairs to the seventh floor instead and is greeted by the sight of millions of spiders in pink liquid. Kraft threatens to toss her into the tank, but then Dink comes and rescues her. He crashes his fist into Kraft\u2019s jaw, and the perpetrators leave him and Orison alone. He explains to her that the creatures are Microfabridae and are more closely related to shellfish than spiders. She holds one, and Dink says that the company is raising them in secret because it does not have a patent. He lets her listen to the hymn of the Microfabridae and feed the tiny creatures. Orison swears that she can see Benjamin Franklin winking at her, but she believes it is nonsense. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Orison is having an interview for the position of secretary in Taft Bank with its vice-president Mr. Wanji. The least is talking slang and wears furry earmuffs and a scarlet vest, not reminding a banker at all. Orison's job is to read into a microphone whatever she is given. After the first day, the new employee is feeling very confused with her tasks, her boss, everyone in the office wearing earmuffs and forbidden upper floors. Turns out she is to spy for Washington in this bank and she writes down her observations. Orison gets a food and a drink and heads home, waiting for a call from Washington. As she doesn't get it, she goes to bed and suddenly hears a voice.   They establish an every day time for the talks and Orison tell everything she saw. The person on the other end, J-12, flirts with her and hangs up. Next morning in the office orison meets the bank president, a handsome young man Dink Gerding. He praises her efforts and asks on a dinner that night. Later, an extravagant woman, Auga, comes in. She shortly warns orison against touching 'her' Dink, following it by serious threats. Right after Kraft Gerding, Dink's elder brother, comes to welcome Orison. He warns her against mixing work and pleasure as well, which makes Orison ask him to leave. Soon she gets a call from Mr. Wangi speaking a strange language. She decides to go up via stairway. On the seventh floor she finds a huge room full of tanks and sees green liquid with pink bubbles inside. The bubbles turn out to be millions of spiders and Orison screams rushing back. There she is captured by Kraft and two earmuffs, who ask about the reasons for her entering the room. Suddenly, Dink enters and frees her, he beats his brother, who knelt to Dink's rank, and everyone leaves except Orison and Dink. The least shows her Microfabridae and gives one to hold, explaining he is no spider, after Orison describes her intrusion as an act of curiosity. Dink embraces Orison and they listen for the singing of little creatures for a while, then they feed them and leave. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story talks about a spy named Miss Orison McCall, and her weird investigation object, the Taft Bank. In the beginning Orison tries to get a job in this bank. She is interviewed by the bank\u2019s vice president, Mr. Wanji, who acts like a racetrack tout. Though Orison\u2019s new job has a higher salary than the previous one, her job is very simple. She only has to read newspapers and fairy-tales to a microphone every day. After finishing a day of work at the Taft Bank, Orison reports what she saw to Washington. Since there has not been any calls, she decides to go to sleep. However, as she lies down, a radio in her pillow talks to her. She is surprised, but agrees to report to the pillow at 11:15 every day from then on. Easy work and high salary, suspicious earmuffs for some of the workers, restricted floors, they all make the bank seems oddly strange. The next day, Orison meets Mr. Dink Gerding who seems to have an interest in Orison and asks her out for dinner. Orison agrees. However, both Mr. Kraft, the elder brother of Dink, and Auga Vingt, who thinks that Dink is hers, warned Orison to keep a distance from Dink.\n\nLater, Mr. Wanji calls Orison and wants her to bring a message to Dink. This gives Orison a vague excuse to explore the higher floors. Through a stairway, Orison goes to the 6th floor, but the door is locked. The door to the 7th floor is not. She pushes through the door and enters. She first thinks that she sees Benjamin Franklin. She got so scared that she screams. Then, mistakenly thinks that the Microfabridae are spiders, which Orison was afraid of, she screams again. Then, the appearance of Kraft and two other men with earmuffs make Orison unable to leave. Kraft threatens Orison. Luckily, Dink appears and saves her from the situation. Orison learns about Microfabridae, which are useful for a secret developing commercial process. Whereas, they are secretly fed by the bank because of the problem of patent.",

He takes her inside the elevator of the building, where he tells her she is not to go past the fifth floor of the building. He takes her to her office on the fifth floor where she will be working. He tells her that her job is to read the paper, as well as different books into a microphone. It is then revealed that the real reason for Orizon's application for this position was to spy on the bank for the government. Mr. Wanji leaves her. Orizon reads into the microphone all morning, then breaks for lunch. She sees more men with earmuffs on the elevator, coming down from the upper floors. She comes back after lunch, and then heads home. \nOrizon arrives home in her apartment, where she waits for Washington to call her, asking for an initial report. At eleven thirty, she decides to go to bed, after having not received any call. Just then, an invisible voice breaks out in the room. It is coming from her pillow, a speaker hiding in it. It belongs to Monitor J-12 from the agency, asking her if she has anything to report. She briefs him on her findings from the day. The next day, Orizon is back in her office, where she meets the president of the bank, Dink Gerding. He tells her she is to be his confidential secretary. He asks her out to dinner and dancing, which she accepts. He leaves, getting in the elevator. Orizon is visited by Kraft Gerding, Dink's older brother, who also warns her not to get involved with Dink. \nOrizon continues to read, when half an hour later, she gets a call from Mr. Wanji. He tells her to pass on a message to Mr. Dink Gerding. She decides to use the excuse of passing on this message to Dink as a reason to explore the upper floors. She opens the door to an expansive room, flooded with light. There are steel tanks all around, filled with green fluid with tiny pink bubbles. She then realises that the pink bubbles are spiders. She screams, and backs into the arms of Kraft. His two men take her by the wrists. He threatens to throw her into the spider tanks if she doesn't tell him what she's doing there. She tells him she has a message for Dink. Dink enters the room, and the two men, including Dink's brother, drop to the floor. Dink goes to her, soothing her, then punches Kraft. He orders the three men to leave. He tells her that the spiders are not spiders at all. They are tiny frustrations called Microfabridae, who eat stone and metal. He tells her he can't explain what they do, as it's confidential. They listen as the tiny creatures sing. "

        "Summary_1": "The location is primarily set at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. Orison\u2019s office is on the fifth floor, and it is a tiny space just large enough to hold a single desk and two chairs. There is also a telephone, a microphone, and a double-decked basket. The basket is an \u201cIn\u201d and \u201cOut\u201d basket for the papers she will read. There is also an elevator, and there are always operators in earmuffs present. Although she is not allowed onto the upper floors by elevator, the building has a staircase that leads up to the upper levels. The sixth floor is locked, but the seventh floor has a glass door that is painted black and a cellar-dark landing. Inside, there is a mass of fluorescent lamps on the ceiling and boarded shut windows. One hundred and eighty steel tanks line the floor. The tanks are half-full with greenish fluid and laced together by angel-hair, delicate white lattices sparkling with pink. \n\nFrom the outside of the building, there is a stand-up counter down the street to eat. There is also a restaurant near Orison\u2019s apartment called the Windsor Arms, where she grabs a meal and a single Martini. Her apartment is described as having a place to shower in and a bed. There is also a pillow, and it is where Monitor J-12 communicates with her. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story starts in a cabinet in Taft Bank with Mr. Wanji, a weirdly dressed up for a banker man, talking to a new employee. Then the two move to the elevators with an operator wearing earmuffs similar to the ones Mr. Wanji has. They enter a tiny office with a single desk, a telephone and a microphone - Orison's new workplace. Later, she goes outside for lunch, meeting a couple more people with earmuffs on. her way from the office. She has lunch in a stand-up place down the street and returns to her tiny office. In the end of the day Orison heads home and stops in a restaurant for food and a drink. After she returns to her apartment waiting for a call from Washington. Home she hears a voice from an unknown monitor in her pillow. Next morning she comes to her office again and has a couple visitors. When they enter the elevator they all keep bowing making the atmosphere rather continental. She goes up through the stairway and enters a huge room on the seventh floor. There are a plenty of tanks and she sees green liquid with pink bubbles in one. The bubbles turn out to be spiders.",
        "Summary_3": "The story focuses on a strange bank which has a total of 14 floors including the basement. Apparently, people without earmuffs can only go to ground floor to fifth floor. Some people who have high ranks, like the President Mr. Dink Gerding and his elder brother Mr. Kraft Gerding can go to the higher floors. Also, this building has an elevator and a stairway. Different operators with earmuffs will be on duty in the elevator. The sixth floor cannot be visited by the stairway since it is locked, but the seventh floor can. On the seventh floor, the bank hides the Microfabridae for a developing commercial process. ",

        "Article": "Orison extended her hand as into a furnace. Dink brushed the\nMicrofabridus from his palm to hers. It felt crisp and hard, like\na legged grain of sand. Dink took a magnifier from his pocket and\nunfolded it, to hold it over Orison's palm.\n  \n \n  \"He's like a baby crawdad,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"A sort of crustacean,\" Dink agreed. \"We use them in a commercial\nprocess we're developing. That's why we keep this floor closed off and\nsecret. We don't have a patent on the use of Microfabridae, you see.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do they do?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  \"That's still a secret,\" Dink said, smiling. \"I can't tell even you\nthat, not yet, even though you're my most confidential secretary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he doing now?\" Orison asked, watching the Microfabridus,\nperched up on the rear four of his six microscopic legs, scratching\nagainst her high-school class-ring with his tiny chelae.\n  \n \n  \"They like gold,\" Dink explained, peering across her shoulder,\ncomfortably close. \"They're attracted to it by a chemical tropism, as\nchildren are attracted to candy. Toss him back into his tank, Orison.\nWe'd better get you down where you belong.\"\n  \n \n  Orison brushed the midget crustacean off her finger into the nearest\ntank, where he joined the busy boil of his fellows. She felt her ring.\nIt was pitted where the Microfabridus had been nibbling. \"Strange,\nusing crawdads in a bank,\" she said. She stood silent for a moment. \"I\nthought I heard music,\" she said. \"I heard it when I came in. Something\nlike the sighing of wind in winter trees.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the hymn of the Microfabridae,\" Dink said. \"They all sing\ntogether while they work, a chorus of some twenty million voices.\" He\ntook her arm. \"If you listen very carefully, you'll find the song these\nlittle workers sing the most beautiful music in the world.\"\n  \n \n  Orison closed her eyes, leaning back into Dink's arms, listening to\nthe music that seemed on the outermost edge of her hearing. Wildness,\nstorm and danger were its theme, counterpointed by promises of peace\nand harbor. She heard the wash of giant waves in the song, the crash\nof breakers against granite, cold and insatiable. And behind this, the\nquiet of sheltered tide-pools, the soft lub of sea-arms landlocked.\n\"It's an ancient song,\" Dink said. \"The Microfabridae have been\nsinging it for a million years.\" He released her, and opened a\nwood-covered wooden box. He scooped up a cupful of the sand inside.\n\"Hold out your hands,\" he told Orison. He filled them with the sand.\n\"Throw our singers some supper for their song,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Orison went with her cupped hands to the nearest tank and sprinkled the\nmineral fishfood around inside it. The Microfabridae leaped from the\nliquid like miniature porpoises, seizing the grains of sand in mid-air.\n\"They're so very strange,\" Orison said. At the bottom of the tank she\nthought she saw Ben Franklin again, winking at her through the bubbling\nlife. Nonsense, she thought, brushing her hands.\n  \n<doc-sep>Penobscot, Maine\n   \n  July 20\n  \n \n  Dear Joe:\n  \n \n  Now you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned it\nin any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across\nto this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a\nquart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel\nwonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.\n  \n \n  There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this\nbody and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now\nI can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today\noutlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must\nfinally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experiments\nyet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of\nthe inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss his\nvibrations.\n  \n \n  I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a\nblonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was\nattracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is\nperfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.\n  \n \n  I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember\ndistinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I\nhad dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.\nWe went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you\nbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the\nmoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.\n  \n \n  Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve\nends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these\nimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the\nadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the\nentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.\n  \n \n  I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the\ntingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself\nquickly.\n  \n \n  Now in all the motion pictures\u2014true representations of life and love\nin this world\u2014the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl\nand tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.\nThis pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,\nwanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would\nhave a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?\n  \n \n  I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.\nWell, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I\nhad not found love.\n  \n \n  I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell\nasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin\nand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.\n  \n \n  I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don't\nI wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?\nI'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is a\ngin mixture.\n  \n \n  I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'll\ntake him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting up\nan atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do\nis activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.\n  \n \n  Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be.

How else, though, could the behavior\nof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she\nthought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks\nand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she\nfinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits\nupper floors.\n  \n \n  Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the\nsudden buzz of her telephone.

What was the curious language\nMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by\ntonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle\nit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,\nshe had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could\nonly fire her.\n  \n \n  Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would\nbe here in a moment with something new to read.

No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her\noff the upstairs floors.\n  \n \n  But the building had a stairway.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to\nseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and\nthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There\nwas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the\nfringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\n  \n \n  She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\n  \n \n  Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room\nextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,\nits ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were\ngalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.\nOrison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred\nand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by\nstrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with\npink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half\nfull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment\nOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the\nliquid. Then she screamed.\n  \n \n \n \n  The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from\nthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions\nupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,\nleaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison\nput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the\nstairway door.\n  \n \n  Into a pair of arms.\n  \n \n  \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said.\nOrison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have\nher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder\nGerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he\nsaid. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless.

The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\nto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\nthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\nMr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n\"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\nand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron\nCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,\nnow that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n  \n \n  The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\nhold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\na microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\n\"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n  \n \n  \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\n\"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you\nget done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to\nread.

Never cared for cats.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Orison McCall,\" she said, and tried to smile back without showing\nteeth.\n  \n \n  \"Delighted,\" the visitor said, handing over an undelighted palm. \"I'm\nAuga Vingt. Auga, to my friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"Won't you sit down, Miss Vingt?\"\n  \n \n  \"So kind of you, darling,\" Auga Vingt said, \"but I shan't have time to\nvisit. I just wanted to stop and welcome you as a Taft Bank co-worker.\nOne for all, all for one. Yea, Team. You know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Orison said.\n  \n \n  \"Common courtesy,\" Miss Vingt explained. \"Also, darling, I'd like to\ndraw your attention to one little point. Dink Gerding\u2014you know, the\nshoulders and muscles and crewcut? Well, he's posted property. Should\nyou throw your starveling charms at my Dink, you'd only get your little\neyes scratched out. Word to the wise,\n   \n   n'est-ce pas\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry you have to leave so suddenly,\" Orison said, rolling her\n   \n   Wall\nStreet Journal\n   \n  into a club and standing. \"Darling.\"\n  \n \n  \"So remember, Tiny, Dink Gerding is mine. You're all alone up here.\nYou could get broken nails, fall down the elevator shaft, all sorts of\nannoyance. Understand me, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"You make it very clear,\" Orison said. \"Now you'd best hurry back to\nyour stanchion, Bossy, before the hay's all gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Isn't it lovely, the way you and I reached an understanding right\noff?\" Auga asked. \"Well, ta-ta.\" She turned and walked to the elevator,\ndisplaying, Orison thought, a disgraceful amount of ungirdled rhumba\nmotion.\n  \n \n  The elevator stopped to pick up the odious Auga. A passenger, male,\nstepped off. \"Good morning, Mr. Gerding,\" Miss Vingt said, bowing.\n  \n \n  \"Carry on, Colonel,\" the stranger replied. As the elevator door closed,\nhe stepped up to Orison's desk. \"Good morning. Miss McCall,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What is this?\" Orison demanded. \"Visiting-day at the zoo?\" She paused\nand shook her head. \"Excuse me, sir,\" she said. \"It's just that ...\nVingt thing....\"\n  \n \n  \"Auga is rather intense,\" the new Mr. Gerding said.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, intense,\" Orison said. \"Like a kidney-stone.\"\n  \n \n  \"I stopped by to welcome you to the William Howard Taft National Bank\nand Trust Company family, Miss McCall,\" he said. \"I'm Kraft Gerding,\nDink's elder brother. I understand you've met Dink already.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. The hair of this new Mr. Gerding was cropped\neven closer than Dink's. His mustache was gray-tipped, like a patch\nof frosted furze; and his eyes, like Dink's, were cobalt blue. The\nhead, Orison mused, would look quite at home in one of Kaiser Bill's\nspike-topped\n   \n   Pickelhauben\n   \n  ; but the ears were in evidence, and seemed\nnormal. Mr. Kraft Gerding bowed\u2014what continental manners these bankers\nhad!\u2014and Orison half expected him to free her hand from the rolled-up\npaper she still clutched and plant a kiss on it.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Dink Gerding is the eccentric president of the bank. He is a tall, handsome man, and Orison assumes that he is around twenty-eight the first time she meets him. He has an older brother named Kraft, but he is higher in power than his brother. When Dink first meets Orison, he is courteous and personally welcomes her to the office. However, he is also rather confident. Dink casually asks her out for dinner despite never meeting her before, and he even offers to dance. However, it is noted that Dink has some form of military experience as a soldier. His shoulders are square, and the crisp clicking of his steps is similar to a military metronome. Nevertheless, Dink is protective of Orison; this is especially shown during the confrontation with his brother. He is also gentle to her around the Microfabridae and is extremely happy when she takes an interest in holding one. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Dink Gerding is the president of Taft Bank. He is a tall handsome man, he is young and full of grace. He is confident and direct as he almost immediately asks Orison on a date, being very convincing. He has muscles and European manners. He also has some connection to military, probably a former soldier. He doesn't look like a bank president, he is respected by everyone and his appearance impresses Orison deeply. Dink is also the highest in rank, which is why everyone bows to him - they have some sort of hierarchy. Even his elder brother kneels to him and has to obey. Dink is rather mild, he saves Orison from his brother and tells as much as he could about the secret Microfabridae. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mr. Dink Gerding is the President of the bank, who has the highest rank. He does not wear earmuffs. To Orison\u2019s mind, he is a handsome, tall, good-mannered and straightforward man. When Orison first meets him, Dink acts like a solider, such as his crisp clicking steps. Also, he does not hide his interest on Orison. Though they just meet and introduced themselves to each other, Dink directly asks Orison out for a dinner together.",
        "Summary_4": "Dink Gerding is the president of the bank where Orizon is spying on. He is a handsome, gentlemanly fellow, who walks with a very purposeful stride, his leather heels clicking as he walks. He bows at Orizon when they first meet, showing his old fashioned manners, something Orizon thinks he must've picked up in Europe, or perhaps more likely, the military. He looks to be around twenty eight, and very tall. Orizon notices how \"kooky\" he is due to his demeanour. He asks her to call him Dink instead of \"Sir\", unusual for a boss who has never met his employee. He then shows his forwardness by asking her out immediately. Later, when Orzion is being threatened by Kraft, Dink comes to her rescue. He holds Orizon, punching Kraft in the face, showing his chivalry. He is understanding when Orizon explains why she is on the upper floors, and shows his kindness when he helps her get over her fear of the Microfabridae. "

His suit of\nhound's-tooth checks, the scarlet vest peeping above the vee of his\njacket, were enough to assure Orison that the Taft Bank was a curious\nbank indeed. \"I gotta say, chick, these references of yours really\nswing,\" said the Vice-President, Mr. Wanji. \"Your last boss says you\ncome on real cool in the secretary-bit.\"\n  \n \n  \"He was a very kind employer,\" Orison said. She tried to keep from\nstaring at the most remarkable item of Mr. Wanji's costume, a pair of\nfurry green earmuffs. It was not cold.\n  \n \n  Mr. Wanji returned to Orison her letters of reference. \"What color\nbread you got eyes for taking down, baby?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Beg pardon?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kinda salary you bucking for?\" he translated, bouncing up and\ndown on the toes of his rough-leather desert boots.\n  \n \n  \"I was making one-twenty a week in my last position,\" Miss McCall said.\n  \n \n  \"You're worth more'n that, just to jazz up the decor,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n\"What you say we pass you a cee-and-a-half a week. Okay?\" He caught\nOrison's look of bewilderment. \"One each, a Franklin and a Grant,\" he\nexplained further. She still looked blank. \"Sister, you gonna work\nin a bank, you gotta know who's picture's on the paper. That's a\nhunnerd-fifty a week, doll.\"\n  \n \n  \"That will be most satisfactory, Mr. Wanji,\" Orison said. It was indeed.\n  \n \n  \"Crazy!\" Mr. Wanji grabbed Orison's right hand and shook it with\nathletic vigor. \"You just now joined up with our herd. I wanna tell\nyou, chick, it's none too soon we got some decent scenery around\nthis tomb, girlwise.\" He took her arm and led her toward the bank of\nelevators. The uniformed operator nodded to Mr. Wanji, bowed slightly\nto Orison. He, too, she observed, wore earmuffs. His were more formal\nthan Mr. Wanji's, being midnight blue in color. \"Lift us to five, Mac,\"\nMr. Wanji said. As the elevator door shut he explained to Orison,\n\"You can make the Taft Bank scene anywhere between the street floor\nand floor five. Basement and everything higher'n fifth floor is Iron\nCurtain Country far's you're concerned. Dig, baby?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. She was wondering if she'd be issued earmuffs,\nnow that she'd become an employee of this most peculiar bank.\n  \n \n  The elevator opened on five to a tiny office, just large enough to\nhold a single desk and two chairs. On the desk were a telephone and\na microphone. Beside them was a double-decked \"In\" and \"Out\" basket.\n\"Here's where you'll do your nine-to-five, honey,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n  \n \n  \"What will I be doing, Mr. Wanji?\" Orison asked.\n  \n \n  The Vice-President pointed to the newspaper folded in the \"In\" basket.\n\"Flip on the microphone and read the paper to it,\" he said. \"When you\nget done reading the paper, someone will run you up something new to\nread. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems a rather peculiar job,\" Orison said. \"After all, I'm a\nsecretary. Is reading the newspaper aloud supposed to familiarize me\nwith the Bank's operation?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bug me, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said. \"All you gotta do is read that\nthere paper into this here microphone. Can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. \"While you're here, Mr. Wanji, I'd like to\nask you about my withholding tax, social security, credit union,\ncoffee-breaks, union membership, lunch hour and the like. Shall we take\ncare of these details now? Or would you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You just take care of that chicken-flickin' kinda stuff any way seems\nbest to you, kid,\" Mr. Wanji said.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Orison said. This laissez-faire policy of Taft Bank's\nmight explain why she'd been selected from the Treasury Department's\nsecretarial pool to apply for work here, she thought. Orison McCall,\ngirl Government spy. She picked up the newspaper from the \"In\" basket,\nunfolded it to discover the day's\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  , and began at\nthe top of column one to read it aloud. Wanji stood before the desk,\nnodding his head as he listened. \"You blowing real good, kid,\" he said.\n\"The boss is gonna dig you the most.\"\n  \n \n  Orison nodded. Holding her newspaper and her microphone, she read the\none into the other. Mr. Wanji flicked his fingers in a good-by, then\ntook off upstairs in the elevator.\n  \n<doc-sep>As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came\nup out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and\ncoat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were\nthere, hurrying home to dinner.\n  \n \n  \"Good night,\" the guard said, locking the door after him.\n  \n \n  \"Good night,\" Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street\ntoward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the\nvault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there\nwas room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.\n  \n \n  At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The\nstreet was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around\u2014and froze.\n  \n \n  From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large\nand shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind.\n  \n \n  What the hell was it?\n  \n \n  Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and\nhungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner\ntable. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous\nand ugly. The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew\nhim on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made\nhim uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened\u2014and fascinated.\n  \n \n  And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.\n  \n<doc-sep>Instead, Kraft Gerding smiled a smile as frosty as his mustache and\nsaid, \"I understand that my younger brother has been talking with you,\nMiss McCall. Quite proper, I know. But I must warn you against mixing\nbusiness with pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Orison jumped up, tossing the paper into her wastebasket. \"I quit!\" she\nshouted. \"You can take this crazy bank ... into bankruptcy, for all I\ncare. I'm not going to perch up here, target for every uncaged idiot in\nfinance, and listen to another word.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dearest lady, my humblest pardon,\" Kraft Gerding said, bowing again,\na bit lower. \"Your work is splendid; your presence is Taft Bank's most\ncharming asset; my only wish is to serve and protect you. To this end,\ndear lady, I feel it my duty to warn you against my brother. A word to\nthe wise....\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   N'est-ce pas?\n   \n  \" Orison said. \"Well, Buster, here's a word to the\nfoolish. Get lost.\"\n  \n \n  Kraft Gerding bowed and flashed his gelid smile. \"Until we meet again?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll hold my breath,\" Orison promised. \"The elevator is just behind\nyou. Push a button, will you? And\n   \n   bon voyage\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  Kraft Gerding called the elevator, marched aboard, favored Orison with\na cold, quick bow, then disappeared into the mysterious heights above\nfifth floor.\n  \n \n  First the unspeakable Auga Vingt, then the obnoxious Kraft Gerding.\nSurely, Orison thought, recovering the\n   \n   Wall Street Journal\n   \n  from her\nwastebasket and smoothing it, no one would convert a major Midwestern\nbank into a lunatic asylum. How else, though, could the behavior\nof the Earmuffs be explained? Could madmen run a bank? Why not, she\nthought. History is rich in examples of madmen running nations, banks\nand all. She began again to read the paper into the microphone. If she\nfinished early enough, she might get a chance to prowl those Off-Limits\nupper floors.\n  \n \n  Half an hour further into the paper, Orison jumped, startled by the\nsudden buzz of her telephone. She picked it up. \"\n   \n   Wanji e-Kal, Datto.\nDink ger-Dink d'summa.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Orison scribbled down this intelligence in bemused Gregg before\nreplying, \"I'm a local girl. Try me in English.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh. Hi, Miss McCall,\" the voice said. \"Guess I goofed. I'm in kinda\nclutch. This is Wanji. I got a kite for Mr. Dink Gerding. If you see\nhim, tell him the escudo green is pale. Got that, doll?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Mr. Wanji. I'll tell Mr. Gerding.\" Orison clicked the phone down.\nWhat now, Mata Hari? she asked herself. What was the curious language\nMr. Wanji had used? She'd have to report the message to Washington by\ntonight's pillow, and let the polyglots of Treasury Intelligence puzzle\nit out. Meanwhile, she thought, scooting her chair back from her desk,\nshe had a vague excuse to prowl the upper floors. The Earmuffs could\nonly fire her.\n  \n \n  Orison folded the paper and put it in the \"Out\" basket. Someone would\nbe here in a moment with something new to read. She'd best get going.\nThe elevator? No. The operators had surely been instructed to keep her\noff the upstairs floors.\n  \n \n  But the building had a stairway.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  The door on the sixth floor was locked. Orison went on up the stairs to\nseven. The glass of the door there was painted black on the inside, and\nthe landing was cellar-dark. Orison closed her eyes for a moment. There\nwas a curious sound. The buzzing of a million bees, barely within the\nfringes of her hearing. Somehow, a very pleasant sound.\n  \n \n  She opened her eyes and tried the knob. The door opened.\n  \n \n  Orison was blinded by the lights, brilliant as noonday sun. The room\nextended through the entire seventh floor, its windows boarded shut,\nits ceiling a mass of fluorescent lamps. Set about the floor were\ngalvanized steel tanks, rectangular and a little bigger than bathtubs.\nOrison counted the rows of tanks. Twelve rows, nine tiers. One hundred\nand eight tanks. She walked closer. The tubs were laced together by\nstrands of angel-hair, delicate white lattices scintillating with\npink. She walked to the nearest of the tubs and looked in. It was half\nfull of a greenish fluid, seething with tiny pink bubbles. For a moment\nOrison thought she saw Benjamin Franklin winking up at her from the\nliquid. Then she screamed.\n  \n \n \n \n  The pink bubbles, the tiny flesh-colored flecks glinting light from\nthe spun-sugar bridges between the tanks, were spiders. Millions\nupon millions of spiders, each the size of a mustard-seed; crawling,\nleaping, swinging, spinning webs, seething in the hundred tanks. Orison\nput her hands over her ears and screamed again, backing toward the\nstairway door.\n  \n \n  Into a pair of arms.\n  \n \n  \"I had hoped you'd be happy here, Miss McCall,\" Kraft Gerding said.\nOrison struggled to release herself. She broke free only to have\nher wrists seized by two Earmuffs that had appeared with the elder\nGerding. \"It seems that our Pandora doesn't care for spiders,\" he\nsaid. \"Really, Miss McCall, our little pets are quite harmless. Were\nwe to toss you into one of these tanks....\" Orison struggled against\nher two\n   \n   sumo\n   \n  -sized captors, whose combined weights exceeded hers by\nsome quarter-ton, without doing more than lifting her feet from the\nfloor. \"... your flesh would be unharmed, though they spun and darted\nall around you. Our Microfabridae are petrovorous, Miss McCall. Of\ncourse, once they discovered your teeth, and through them a skeleton of\ncalcium, a delicacy they find most toothsome, you'd be filleted within\nminutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Elder Compassion wouldn't like your harming the girl, Sire,\" one of\nthe earmuffed\n   \n   sumo\n   \n  -wrestlers protested.\n  \n \n  \"Elder Compassion has no rank,\" Kraft Gerding said. \"Miss McCall, you\nmust tell me what you were doing here, or I'll toss you to the spiders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dink ... Dink!\" Orison shouted.\n  \n \n  \"My beloved younger brother is otherwise engaged than in the rescue of\ndamsels in distress,\" Kraft said. \"Someone, after all, has to mind the\nbank.\"\n  \n \n  \"I came to bring a message to Dink,\" Orison said. \"Let me go, you\nacromegalic apes!\"\n  \n \n  \"The message?\" Kraft Gerding demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Something about escudo green. Put me down!\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Wanji is the Vice-President of the bank and the first person Orison meets. His fashion choice is not the same as a public picture banker. When she first applies for her job, he wears a hound\u2019s-tooth check suit and a scarlet vest. He also wears a pair of furry green earmuffs even though it is not cold. To top off his outfit, he matches it with a pair of rough-leather desert boots. Orison does not know his ethnicity, but she guesses if he is Oriental based on his name. He speaks strangely too, and Orison finds herself unable to understand him unless he says in plain English. It is a very casual form of speech with lots of slang mixed in. Later, when he calls Orison, he speaks in a completely different language. Mr. Wanji is loud and carefree, as he did not hesitate to give Orison more money than supposedly her last job paid. When she asks him about tax numbers and social security information, he waves it off as if it is nothing. He is very carefree, too, sending Orison to deliver a message to Dink when she is supposed not ever be allowed to the upper floors. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Wanji is the vice-president of Taft Bank. He is dressed up in a weird way, nothing like a banker - scarlet vest, hound's-tooth suit, furry green earmuffs. He talks in some sort of a jargon and doesn't want to bother himself with additional tasks, he is rather relaxed. He talks some strange unknown language with other workers. Dink considers him careless. He seems not strict and indifferent, his talk is emotional and contented, overall he seems funny. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mr. Wanji is the First Vice-President of the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. He is also the one who interviews Miss Orison McCall and gives her the job of reading newspapers and story books. He is an energetic man who talks like a racetrack tout. Also, Mr. Wanji does not like to deal with small details, so he gives Orison much freedom to decide things like lunch union, withholding tax, and social security. He is careless as well. He called Orison by mistake, so he directly let Orison to tell Dink a message. But he does not tell her where to find Dink, which gave Orison a vague excuse to explore the upper floors that she is restricted to enter.",
        "Summary_4": "Mr. Wanji is the Vice President of William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. He is very unusual in the way he dresses. The way he speaks is even more peculiar, it being something like English, but not quite, almost like he speaks in code. He calls Orizon ``baby\", noting how attractive she is, obviously showing his built in misogyny through his objectification of a female employee. He then later calls Orizon, once again speaking in even stranger code, asking her to relay a message to Dink. He is a very mysterious and zany character. \n"

        "Summary_1": "With pressure coming from Fred, who elected him into this investigation, Tremaine first goes to the police station to meet his friend who works here so that he can get familiar with the town and learn about unusual activities and strange events if there are any. Jess, the police officer, is surprised to see Tremaine coming back to this town. Tremaine asks Jess if he has any idea of a transmitter in this area, however, Jess does not seem really interested in the transmitters as he think drawing is a beer advertisement. Afterwards, Jess tells Tremaine about the old man Bram who seems to have lived in this town forever. He is the mystery man of the town. As a foreigner who no one knows much about, he seems strange. Knowing that Bram has lived on the same property since as long as anyone could remember, he goes to the Municipal Office of Records to check the last time that there was a change of hands on Bram\u2019s property.  \n\nThen Tremaine goes to the Elsby Public Library, checking for the newspapers around the time when Bram bought the property. On his way back to the hotel that he is staying at, he notices Grammond\u2019s men. But Tremaine has told Grammond to keep his men away from this town for now. Apparently, Grammond didn\u2019t listen, Tremaine is afraid that with the police searching around the town, the person they are looking for will sense that something is off, and will hide before they are able to find him/her.\n\nDesiring to learn more about this old man, Jess has also mentioned to Tremaine that Linda Carroll had been with Bram for a while when Carroll was in her twenties, which is a few decades ago. So then Tremaine goes to Carroll\u2019s house hoping to learn more about the mysterious man Bram. Then after he left Carroll\u2019s house, he goes to Bram\u2019s house together with Jess. Shots were fired, the house is empty, but Bram is not there. They go straight to Hull Gaskin to ask questions since he did set fire on Bram\u2019s place before. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Tremaine, a former hyperwave lab worker, dials Washington from a hotel room in his old hometown. On the other end Fred, an appointive official, is impatiently waiting for Tremaine to catch the transmitter who intervened with their Top Secret project. Jimmy Tremaine visits an old acquaintance Jess in a local police department, the former shares details of his secret mission and asks whether Jess has any idea who can be the transmitter. Jess says everyone around is bad with technologies, but Mr. Bram is a mystery man, so it could be him. The man is a foreigner but he has been living in the town for so long that no one knows when and where he came from. Not long ago his house was set on fire by a bunch of kids, nothing serious. Jess tells a story about the past: a local beauty by then, Miss Carol, wanted nothing to do with locals and set her trap for Mr. Bram. They left a party together and the next morning she was back alone. Her reputation was destroyed, she never married and now works as a teacher. Tremaine heads towards the Elsby Town Hall, he learns that Bram bought his property in 1901. Then in the local public library he finds an article concerning this purchase, then he sees an article of July 7, 1900 regarding a severe thunderstorm. Near the hotel he notices a car and heads after the police to ask Grammond, the chief, to keep the police away from the hotel so as not to scare off the intermitter. Grammond is offended by being kept ignorant. Further, Jimmy heads to Miss Carol's and asks questions about Mr. Bram, she can't answer them for sure and a tear drops from her eye. Soon, she decides to tell about the night at Bram's place back in the years : he told he fought evil every night, went downstairs for the whole night and left her alone. Then he gave her a locket and said to press in a particular way if he is ever needed. Miss Carol considered him crazy and never met me again. She says Bram fears thunder and gives Jimmy the locket. Jess picks Jimmy up to look for Bram who hasn't shown up recently. The two enter the deserted house with Tremaine's gun, they see blood in the kitchen making up a trail. They go back to talk to Hull, a boy who set Bram's house on fire recently. Turns out he considered Bram a spy as he is a foreigner and a communist, and the boy heard the boys were looking for spies. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Jimmy Tremaine works for the government, conducting a secret operation about implementing hyperwaves in the military. An interfering transmission had recently been detected tampering with the hyperwaves, and when tracked down, the source seems to come from Elsby, Tremaine's hometown. Fred, Tremaine's superior, orders Tremaine to figure out where the transmission is coming from before he interferes his own way. Tremaine visits Elsby's police station, where he meets Jess. Tremaine tells Jess about the transmission and asks if he has any ideas or leads on the situation. Jess is stumped, but notes that Mr. Bram is an odd character at Elsby, who has been there for an unusually long amount of time. Curious about Mr. Bram, Tremaine goes to the Office of Record, where he bribes the man at the counter to tell him the year that Mr. Bram purchased his home, which is revealed to be 1901. The clerk also tells Tremaine that no one has seen Bram between sundown and sunup. Tremaine then visits the library, where he finds an article about Bram purchasing the house, as well as an account of a thunderstorm that occurred there a year before the purchase. On his way back from the library, Tremaine sees a police car speeding off, and he follows. He gets in contact with the State Police Chief, who does not approve of being left out of Tremaine's investigation. Tremaine speaks to Miss Carroll, known to have had a history with Bram. She tells Tremaine about her encounter with Bram and how he kept her in a cave under his house for the night, and she never spoke to him again. She also tells Tremaine that Bram is afraid of thunder. As Tremaine walks back to his room, Jess finds him and asks how the investigation is going, and Tremaine replies that he is stumped. Jess suggests that they visit Bram's house together, and the two enter and see an empty gun shell. They find blood in the kitchen. Jess and Tremaine then visit a police station where they find Hull Gaskin, who admits to shooting Bram after some cops prompted him to help catch spies. ",
        "Summary_4": "Tremaine calls Fred from his hotel room and gives him an update on his progress. Fred expresses his frustration with the progress and complains that General Margrave has been breathing down his neck about the case. Tremaine tells Fred to be confident in him and Fred ends by yelling that he wants the transmitter and for someone to pay. Tremaine eventually leaves his hotel room and heads towards the local police station. At the station, Tremaine greets Jess once he enters the building. The two go to have a private conversation where Tremaine tries to get Jess\u2019s help with a case. Jess tells Tremaine what he knows about Bram from what he\u2019s heard and what he\u2019s seen. It is clear that Bram lives a very private life. \n\nOnce his conversation with Jess finishes, Tremaine goes to the Municipal office of Records at the town hall. He has to bribe a reluctant man in the office to let him look for the information that he needs. He is able to find out information about Bram\u2019s property and then leaves to go to the library to gather more information. At the library, Tremaine looks through old newspapers. He learns from one newspaper about a severe thunderstorm that affected the Bram property.  \n\nBack at his hotel room, Tremaine has a tense phone call with Fred. When it ends, he pours himself a glass of scotch. After finishing his drink, he goes to Miss Carroll\u2019s nearby house Tremaine asks her about Bram. She is unable to give him many details about Bram. However, Miss Carroll does willingly detail her personal relationship with Bram. Carroll mentions that Bram gave her a locket and to use it to contact him if she ever needed his help. Tremaine asks for the locket and she hands it over to him. She mentions that she remembers how Bram was afraid of thunder. With all the information that he could gather from Miss Carroll, Tremaine leaves her house.\n\nUpon leaving Miss Carroll\u2019s house, Jess pulls up to Tremaine on the street in his car and they decide to go check on Bram as he hasn\u2019t been seen in a while. The two get out of their car once they reach the property and inspect the outside of the house. They become alert by the suspicious state of the house, especially because of the empty shotgun shell that they find, so they retrieve a gun from the car for their safety. They start hearing strange noises once they enter the house, causing them both to become uneasy. Inside the kitchen, they spot a suspicious trail of blood and hear another strange sound. They decide to go to the police station to ask Hull Gaskin \u2013 one of the teens arrested for setting fire to Bram\u2019s property- some questions. Hull says that he was approached by cops asking him to help them find spies. He says he told them about Bram because he\u2019s a foreigner.  \n"

An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught\nhis eye:\n  \n \n  A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much\nalarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and\nthunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine\nwoods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of\ntimber and threatened the house before burning itself out along\nthe river.\n  \n \n  The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.\nYou'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in\nwindows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a\ncold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n  \n \n  A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint\nsqueal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward\nof the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped\nshort, stared after the car.\n  \n \n  \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.\nTremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked\nopen the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed\nnorth after the police car.\n  \n",

The clerk at the Municipal Office of Record is confident that Bram has never been seen between sundown and sunup. He also tells Tremaine that the property that Bram currently lives on was purchased by him in 1901. Tremaine learns from the newspapers that the same property was accidentally caught on fire from a thunderstorm about a year before the transaction was made between Bram and J. P. Spivey. Interestingly, from Jess, Tremaine also learns that Hull and his friends started a fire on Bram\u2019s place some time ago. \n\nTremaine acknowledged the relationship between the young Bram and young Linda Carroll. Carroll explains to Tremaine how he told her that there is a cave beneath his house. And every night he has to fight evil beings that are right below his house. He went downstairs for the night and by the time he came up, it was dawn. Later, he handed her a locket which allows her to ask him to come simply by pressing it in a certain way. Moreover, Carroll tells Tremaine that he is afraid of thunder. Furthermore, after Bram has gone missing, Tremaine learns from Hull that Bram is a Commie. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Bram is a foreigner which is rare in the town. He came such a long time ago that no one knows when and where from. From the record, Tremaine finds out Bram bought his house soon after his arrival in the year 1901, so he should be in his nineties now. A year before the purchase a severe thunderstorm took place. Bram is never seen at night. He is a mystic figure and there are legends about his house. He courted Miss Carol, who is an unmarried old lady. He told her he fought evil every night in his house downstairs. She also says he is afraid of thunder. He gave her a locket to touch in a particular way to call him and she considers him crazy. Local boys consider him a spy and a communist. Now he disappeared. ",
        "Summary_3": "Bram remains a mystery is Elsby, but Tremaine has gathered some information about him. Jess tells him that Bram has been at Elsby for a long time, and has outlived some residents abnormally. The clerk at the Record Office helps Tremaine gather more information about Bram's house, and tells Tremaine that Bram has never been spotted overnight. Miss Carroll tells Tremaine about her encounter with Bram, and also tells him that he is afraid of thunder.",
        "Summary_4": "Tremaine gathers different information from different people throughout the story. From Jess, Tremaine gathers information about Bram\u2019s routines. According to Jess, Bram comes into town about once a week to buy his groceries, specifically on Wednesdays. It\u2019s not known where Bram is from but it is assumed that he is a foreigner. Jess tells Tremaine that recently some delinquent kids set Bram\u2019s place on fire and Bram has not been seen since the incident. \n\nFrom the worker at the Municipal Office of Record, he finds out when Bram bought his property. The clerk continues to tell him some rumors about Bram, such as Bram\u2019s place supposedly being haunted and having money buried on the property. \n\nAt the library, Tremaine is able to learn more information about Bram from old newspapers. He learns who originally owned the property and how Bram was a newcomer to the area. \n"

        "Query": "What was the nature of Bram and Carroll's relationship in THE LONG REMEMBERED THUNDER?",
        "Article": "Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country?

Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,\nfrowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n\neight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties\u2014and that made\nher an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting\nher cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six\nfoot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair\u2014and a stranger to\nboot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local\nbucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny\nabout any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But\nthis was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down\nthere; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,\npractically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy\nshay. And the next day, she was home again\u2014alone. That finished off\nher reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was\nten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was\nalready old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram\nin front of her.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears\nand eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.\nMeantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of\ndetector you were going to set up?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up\nin my room over at the hotel.\"\n  \n \n  \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n  \n \n  \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely\nrepeating logarithmic sequence, based on\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me\nknow if you want anything. And by the way\u2014\" he winked broadly\u2014\"I\nalways did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front\nteeth.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town\nHall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow\nautumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the\nsteps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,\na hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said\n\"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n  \n \n  A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at\nTremaine.\n  \n \n  \"We're closed,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the\nBram property changed hands last.\"\n  \n \n  The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?\nHe dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n  \n \n  The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to\nsell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n  \n \n  The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping\nto save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.\nA folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward\nit. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n  \n \n  \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n  \n \n  It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where\na two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a\nline written in faded ink:\n  \n \n  \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&V consid. NW Quarter\nSection 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 & cet.)\"\n  \n \n  \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n  \n \n  \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the\nnineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to\nthe door.\n  \n \n  \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of\ntrouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No trouble.\"\n  \n \n  The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"\nhe said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be\ndern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess you're right.\"\n  \n \n  The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about\nold Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and\nlights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.\n\"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014uh\u2014paying anything for information?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n  \n \n  The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway\u2014I can swear to this.\nNobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "From Jess, Tremaine learns that the school teacher, Linda Carroll had a relationship with Bram while they were young. Carroll\u2019s family is quite wealthy and she was very beautiful. People in the town was not really up to her standards. Bram is a foreigner and does not really like social events. However, apparently, Carroll went off together with Bram one day afternoon with almost the whole town there. Then the next day Bram was not by her side, she came back by herself. This made her reputation really bad and she could not even be hired as a teacher for 10 years afterwards. From Carroll, Tremaine learns another story. She seems to not know Bram well. She confirms that she and Bram was in a relationship. And after Bram invited her to his place one day, he explains that he has to fight evil beings below his house every night. After they arrived at his house, she was left in the carriage for the whole night while he was below the house until dawn. Thus she decided to not talk to him when him came to see her in the carriage again. He gave her a locket where a pattern of tapping would allow him to get to her if she ever needs him. Interestingly, she also tells Tremaine that Bram is afraid of the thunder.",
        "Summary_2": "Back in the years, when Carol was in her twenties and Bram a couple years older, he courted her. She was the prettiest young lady in town, unmarried as all locals were too good for her. She was determined to get this foreigner and even made a plan. He was a handsome young man, not a social type of a person, but he was somehow dragged to a shiny. He left together with Carol in the evening, took her to his house and scared her on the way. He talked about fighting evil every night and some other crazy things and disappeared downstairs. She waited outside the whole night and was scared of his madness, she had no intention of listening to him. He gave her a locket which would summon him if used in the right way. They never met again. The memories are still painful for Carol, her reputation was destroyed and she stayed unmarried. ",
        "Summary_3": "In the past, Bram and Carroll had pursued a romantic relationship. He had courted her and taken her to his house, where he scared her by telling her that he fights with evil beings in his house and then locking her beneath the kitchen. The next morning, Bram gave Carroll a locket to keep. Carroll refused to speak to Bram again, telling him that he needed to seek a doctor. The two had not spoken since, but it is revealed that Carroll kept the locket Bram had given her since. ",
        "Summary_4": "Jess tells Tremaine how something romantic happened between Carroll and Bram. However, from his knowledge, it did not end well and Carroll\u2019s reputation was ruined from the events. \n\nFrom Miss Carroll\u2019s own words, she says that her experience with Bram was a bad one. He took her out on a date but began to act strange and talking as if he was crazy. He disappeared, running down a set of stays. Meanwhile, she stayed alone in the car all night.

        "Article": "Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street\nand turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY\nMUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a\nheavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind\nan ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the\nopposite corner of his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of\nauthority.\n  \n \n  Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,\nthough.\"\n  \n \n  The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He\ncame to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy?

Between us, there's more.\"\n  \n \n  Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n  \n \n  \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered\nthe discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the\nhigh-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission\nproduced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He\npassed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric\ncircles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n  \n \n  \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these\npoints of intersection.

He took out a heavy key, swung\nthe cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong\nwith burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that\nout, Hull?\"\n  \n \n  \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we\nheard....\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you hear?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who says so?\"\n  \n \n  The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to\nthe corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all\nnight.\"\n  \n \n  \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot.

He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all\nover again.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in\nthe drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around\nwith me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the\nprescription counter and look nervous.

        "Query": "What is the location of the events in THE LONG REMEMBERED THUNDER?",
        "Article": "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n  \n \n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n  \n \n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n  \n<doc-sep>The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight\n   \n   short\n   \n  days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his\nmother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed\nrapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\n  \n \n  Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence\nwas a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age\nan inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\n  \n \n  Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his\nfather now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\n  \n \n  This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every\nsecond of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\n  \n \n \n   Because in a few hours they'd be dead.\n   \n \n \n  This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal\nstate hadn't he dreamed of\n   \n   long\n   \n  lives, valleys not of blasted stone\nbut green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then\nthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long\nlife? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and\ndepressing in eight short, vanishing days?\n  \n \n  How had his people gotten into such a condition?\n  \n \n  As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n  \n \n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n  \n \n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n  \n \n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n  \n \n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n  \n \n  His mind flexed.\n  \n \n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n  \n \n  The cliff groaned.\n  \n \n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n  \n \n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n  \n \n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n  \n \n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n  \n \n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n  \n \n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n  \n \n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n  \n \n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n  \n \n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n  \n \n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n  \n \n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n  \n \n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n  \n \n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n  \n \n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n  \n \n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n  \n \n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n  \n \n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n  \n \n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n  \n \n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n  \n \n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n  \n \n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability.\n  \n",

        "Article": "Unwillingly, Joe agreed. While Genius retreated to a safe distance,\nthey entered the ship and blasted off. Within a few minutes the\nautomatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of the\nasteroid belt.\n  \n \n  \"I got kind of dizzy,\" Joe said, \"there were so many deals back and\nforth. How much did we make on the sucker?\"\n  \n \n  \"A goodly amount, I wager,\" Harvey responded. He took out a pencil and\npaper. \"Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199.

We were,\nafter all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more\nI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty\nredsents on the swindler.

So, after\nall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\"\n  \n \n  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on\nMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Goldbricks!\n   \n  \" Harvey said succinctly.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered.

I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n  \n<doc-sep>When we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\nboots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\nwould have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\nhigh boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n  \n \n  Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\nenjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\npleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\nsee three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\nhis head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\nThen he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\nimpenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\nto another village.\n  \n \n  Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\nhuts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n  \n \n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n  \n \n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n  \n \n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n  \n \n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n  \n \n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n  \n \n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n  \n \n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n  \n \n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n  \n \n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n  \n \n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n  \n \n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Major Polk is given orders by his Boss, Colonel Walsh, to go to Venus in search of a man named Joe. Mars is in open revolt against the Colonel and the system that he runs, and Walsh tells Polk that there is a man on Venus who will be able to solve the problem of the revolt, as he spent time on Mars, and knows the natives. The Major and the Colonel hate each other, and it's clear from the get-go that the Colonel is setting the Major up for a trap. He tells Polk that the man's name is Joe, and that he has an affinity for Terran cigarettes. The Major travels to Venus to find this man, and complete the mission. When he arrives though, it becomes clear to him soon that every native Venusian is named Joe, and they all love cigarettes. Polk calls the Major from the office on Venus, asking for extra information, but the Colonel gives none. He has screwed him. The Major decides to look for this man regardless, as returning to Earth without having completed the mission could mean a demotion or a loss of job. He hires a guide to take him through the jungle terrain of Venus, obviously named Joe. As they spend weeks traveling through the jungle together they quickly become friends. They stop at various villages together, where they meet the locals, they chat on their walks and the Major tells Joe all about his past. After a few weeks, they arrive at a village, where a starship and the Colonel are waiting for them. He has a gun pointer and Polk, informing him he plans on killing him, because Polk ratted on Walsh when they were in the academy together about dozing off while he was on watch over a tank filled with uranium. Just before he goes to shoot the Major, he starts insulting the locals of Mars, and then natives in general. Joe becomes visibly upset. The story ends, and it's presumed that Joe will save the Major. ",
        "Summary_2": "Colonel Walsh has appointed Major Polk for a mission on Venus. The two hate each other strongly due to a history at the Academy and Walsh's totalitarian nature towards natives on Mars. The Colonel tells Major Polk that he is to find a specific Venusian native named Joe, who is experienced in trading and loves cigarettes. Major Polk arrives on Mars and immediately meets a Venusian named Joe, but he soon realizes that it is not the man in question. The Major goes into the Officer's Club, where the Venusian bartender is also named Joe. Perplexed, the Major realizes that every native on Venus is named Joe. He meets with Captain Bransten, who tells him that since becoming in contact with Terran men, the Venusians had picked up their mannerisms and behaviors, including their love for cigarettes. Major Polk realizes that the Colonel has sent him on a goose chase, in impossible search of a man. Major Polk calls the Colonel, who smugly assures him that he can find the man in the jungle. The Major decides to play along with Walsh's trick and find a man for the mission. He meets a Venusian tour guide to take him through the jungle, who he gradually befriends as they visit several villages. With still no luck finding the right Joe, Major Polk soon encounters Walsh aboard his ship flying above him. Walsh tells Polk that he will kill him, recalling the time Polk reported him at the Academy. He then expresses his frustration with dealing with the natives on Mars.",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with the Major being told by Colonel Walsh that he is going to be sent to find a man on Venus. The Colonel says that the man is a Venusian native that holds very valuable information about Mars. He says the man is named Joe and that he likes cigarettes. The Major tries to gather more information but the Colonel only gives him vague answers with a grin on his face. So, with his orders, the Major heads to Venus. When he steps off the ship, he is greeted by a man named Joe. He is shocked because he initially believes it could be the Joe he needs. However, he soon realizes that it is not the correct Joe and asks to be directed to the Officer\u2019s Club. Once he gets inside and goes to the bar, the bartender introduces himself as Joe. \n\nThe Major realizes that Walsh played a trick on him. He\u2019s upset at Walsh for sending him on a petty, retaliatory trip. Frustrated, he heads to the Captain\u2019s shack, where he asks why everyone is named Joe. The Captain chuckles in response and replies that it\u2019s an unoriginal culture. Joe grows angry upon learning this. He\u2019s taken to his sleeping quarters after the meeting. He calls the Colonel and asks for more information on the Joe he\u2019s meant to find. The Colonel finds amusement knowing that Polk has realized his predicament. All the Colonel offers up to the Major is that Joe is somewhere in the jungle. In response, he asks for a guide to take him. As he\u2019s waiting, he thinks of the Colonel\u2019s intentions and how he should respond. The Major decides to go along with the trip and do his best. Once he meets his guide, they head off through the jungle. \n\nHis guide takes him through the jungle, proving to be helpful and useful. They find themselves going from village to village with days turning into weeks spent in the jungle searching for a specific Joe. Joe smiles at some of the Major\u2019s complaints of the tedious nature of the journey in an unusual way during their journey. They eventually reach another village and Joe smiles very wide when he delivers the news to Major Polk. The Major notices that there are no natives in the new village. He sees the Colonel standing near a ship with a stun gun pointed at him. It also seems like Joe knew that the Colonel would be there. Walsh tells the Major that he is going to kill him. As they tensely converse with each other, Joe chuckles and is excited with glee during the conversation. However, when Mars is mentioned, Joe stops being excited and a frown starts to form on his face. Walsh begins to shout hateful words about natives when he realizes that Joe is a native. Joe changes his attitude and looks at the Colonel in confusion. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts with Colonel Walsh assigning Major Polk the job of finding a man named Joe on Venus to help them with the revolt on Mars. Despite the fact that he has never been to Venus and Venus is not even in their jurisdiction, Colonel Walsh calls it a simple assignment and asks the Major to travel to Venus. After arriving on Venus, he immediately encounters a boy called Joe. However, this Joe is not the person that he is looking for. Before reporting to Captain Bransten, the Major decides to stop for a drink. He asks Joe to take him there. Somehow, this Joe realizes that the Major is new to this place after he tips him. After arriving at the bar, he meets two more Joes talking to each other, calling each other Joe. Neither is the one that the Major needs to find. Later, he learns from the Captain that the name Joe is just a culture here on Venus, and the natives all like cigarettes. This makes the Major furious since those are two of the few characteristics provided by Colonel Walsh. After chow, the Major calls Walsh, who is on Earth. After getting the information that this Joe is in the jungle, he asks a Joe to find him a guide for going into the jungle. Then, Major begins to realize that maybe Colonel Walsh didn\u2019t want him back since he is the next in line for command. He decides to be more careful. Following the guide, the Major walks from village to village, searching the natives for that particular Joe. The Major and the guide get close and become friend. However, the next village they visit does not have any natives, only Colonel Walsh. And Colonel is there to kill the Major."

        "Query": "What caused the animosity between the Colonel and the Major in A PLANET NAMED JOE?",
        "Article": "Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\nto greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n  \n \n  \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n  \n \n  He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n  \n \n  And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\nthe sun like a great silver bullet.\n  \n \n  \"What...?\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n  \n \n  The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\nthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\nstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look\ncheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n  \n \n  \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\njoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n  \n \n  Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\nhappiness.\n  \n \n  \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\nwas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n  \n \n  I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel,\n   \n   Major\n   \n  .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\nfinality.\n  \n \n  I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd\nbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\npointing the stun gun at my middle.\n  \n \n  \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\nhave.\"\n  \n \n  Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\nsmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\ngoing to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\nit'll rain tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\nthis. Another of those funny Terran games.\n  \n \n  \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\nshould thank you, really.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\nwhen you decided to cork off.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n  \n \n  \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\nnudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\nsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n  \n \n  Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\naudible.

And I meant it.\n  \n \n  \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\nunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\ngame, the fun?\n  \n \n  \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\nnever any trouble before you took command.\"\n  \n \n  \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n  \n \n  Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\nsay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\nOr maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n  \n \n  \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n  \n \n  \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\nsavages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\nThe perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face.

Perhaps there was method in Colonel\n    \n   Walsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major\n    \n   Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories\n   \n  November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\n   \n  U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since\nwe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\n  \n \n  For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.\nHe might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as\nI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At\nleast, that's what he told me.\n  \n \n  I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\nsomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\nSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of\nit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and\nthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get\nby with gravy.\n  \n \n  \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\nhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\n  \n \n  I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on\nthe job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his\nfingers.\n  \n \n  \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then\nadded, \"For a native, that is.\"\n  \n \n  I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the\nway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.\nWhich brought to mind an important point.\n  \n \n  \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I\nthought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\n  \n \n  He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk\nas if he were waiting for me to cut.\n  \n \n  \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so\nhappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just\nwhat's happening on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very\nfar.\n  \n \n  \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If\nanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\n  \n \n  If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give\nthem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called\nit \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at\nleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\n  \n \n  \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never\nbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It\nwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported\nhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium\nthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\nHe still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by\nreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\nany military organization, he outranked me.\n  \n \n  \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n  \n \n  \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\nfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\nlike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\nPersonal habits? Anything?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like\nany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He\ndoes have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people.

        "Summary_1": "The Colonel and the Major seemed as if they were acquaintances before they first fell out. The Colonel had called the Major, by his first name, Fred. Now, he only calls him Major, as a mark of disrespect, since the colonel somehow outranks him. The Colonel also demands that Polk use his proper title, as a way of putting him down. They initially fell out because one night, while the Colonel was supposed to be on boiled watch, guarding the uranium in a tank beneath the barracks, he fell asleep on duty. The entire barracks could've been blown up. The Major had to report him to their superiors. This meant that the colonel's career took a big hit, and he had to fight his way back into the ranks. He felt as if the Major betrayed him, and ratted him out. Now, the Colonel is in charge of Mars, where he has caused a revolt based on his shocking treatment of the natives. His prejudice towards the native people of Venus and Mars is another reason the Major hates him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Colonel and the Major attended the Academy together, and the two have despised each other since. At the Academy, Major Polk had reported the Colonel for falling asleep on duty, risking severe damage. Major Polk also holds reservations about the Colonel because of Walsh's treatment of natives, specifically on Mars after conquering the planet. He understands why there is a revolt against Walsh on Mars, given the way he degrades its natives. Colonel Walsh still holds reservations towards Major Polk since he reported him.",
        "Summary_3": "Colonel Walsh and Major Polk have hated each other ever since they both went through the Academy at the same time. The Major does not like Walsh\u2019s attitude towards natives, especially how he treats them. From this, it is able to be discerned that Walsh has a very unfavorable attitude towards natives and regularly insults or hurts them. He also does not believe that the Colonel is understanding the severity of the current military situation. The Major also believes that Walsh does a bad job of managing the planet. The hatred that the Colonel has towards the Major is because the Major reported him for sleeping on the job while they were both at the Academy. The Major defends his reporting of the Colonel by arguing that the Colonel was supposed to be watching a uranium supply that was very dangerous and could have killed many people. \n\nThe Colonel appears to be threatened by the Major because he would be next in line of command if the Colonel is ousted from his position. The Colonel acknowledges that he is possibly failing at his job with the Mars issue and does not want to be demoted and for Major Polk to take over his job. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Major and Colonel were in the same Academy. But one time, the Colonel fell asleep on Boiler Watch. There was a pile of uranium that could\u2019ve blown up the whole Academy. When the Major caught this he reported him. But apparently, the Colonel still thinks that it is the Major\u2019s fault for reporting him. The Major also dislikes the way that the Colonel treats the natives. He calls them savages. The Colonel sends the Major to Venus and tells him a non-description of a man that he needs to find. This annoys the Major. He gets angry especially when he finds out that the description is completely useless since every man here names Joe and likes cigarette. The Colonel actually sends the Major here to kill him. "

He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered.

Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe.

The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\nwould have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\nhigh boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n  \n \n  Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\nenjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\npleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\nsee three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\nhis head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\nThen he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\nimpenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\nto another village.\n  \n \n  Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\nhuts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n  \n \n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n  \n \n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n  \n \n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n  \n \n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n  \n \n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n  \n \n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n  \n \n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n  \n \n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n  \n \n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n  \n \n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n  \n \n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining.\n  \n",

There are plants everywhere, of all sizes and varieties, some with strange and wonderful flowers. There is a station for Space II, which includes The Officers Club: a small shack which functions as a bar, and The Captain's Shack. The world is covered in thick jungle, which is impossible to orient unless you're a local. The floor of the jungle is filled with sharp undergrowth that would shred your feet. In the jungle are little hidden pathways that lead to small villages, where native Venusians live. \n",

Major Polk describes the planet as very hot with a strange smell, with unfamiliar plants. The natives on Venus are tall, blue, human looking figures. Major Polk first visits the Officer's Club, a tiny hut. Later in the story, Major Polk is guided through the jungles of Venus by Joe, which are described as impenetrable and humid.",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins on Earth. Major Polk is at the Patrol Station in Area Two on Earth to meet with the Colonel. Major Polk is assigned to find a man on Venus by the Colonel. So, he heads to Venus. The Major describes the planet as incredibly hot and uncomfortable. It also has a smell that isn\u2019t easily discernible. There are large and small plants with unusual flowers dotted all over the place. The first place that the Major goes to on Venus is the Officer\u2019s Club, a hut with window shields meant to protect from the heat. Nevertheless, the place was still very hot inside. Inside there were some seating, basic bar games, and the bar where a Venusian bartender stood. Once he leaves the bar, he heads to the Captain\u2019s shack to find more information on the situation. Eventually leaving the Captain\u2019s shack, he goes to his sleeping quarters. After finding a guide, the Major and his guide head off into the jungle in search of a Joe. They go through a thick jungle, encountering different villages along the way. The jungle is so thick that occasionally, the guide has to use a knife to cut through the brush. After weeks, they make it to one particular village where the Major spots a ship that catches the rays of the sun. The Colonel is standing near the ship with a gun pointed at Major Polk. ",
        "Summary_4": "The main setting of the story is on Venus, where the temperature is very hot and has a strange smell. The whole planet is filled with plants, big and small, blooming and bare. There is a heavily overgrown path that leads to the Officer\u2019s Club. The bar has pastel hut and window shields for protection against the sun. The bar has some chairs and tables, a dart game, and a bar. Captain Bransten\u2019s office has a desk and there is a button on the desk that would call for a Venusian. There is also a screen for calling Earth. The Major\u2019s quarter also has a buzzer near his bed. The jungle is filled with plants, and sometimes even fogs. The villages have natives and huts that they live in. Later in the village where there is no natives, there is only a ship that has the crest of Space II. "

Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n  \n \n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n  \n \n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n  \n \n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n  \n \n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n  \n \n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n  \n \n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n  \n \n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n  \n \n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n  \n \n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n  \n \n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n  \n \n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining.\n  \n<doc-sep>  A PLANET NAMED JOE\n  \n \n  By S. A. LOMBINO\n  \n \n \n   There were more Joes on Venus than you could shake\n    \n   a ray-gun at. Perhaps there was method in Colonel\n    \n   Walsh's madness\u2014murder-madness\u2014when he ordered Major\n    \n   Polk to scan the planet for a guy named Joe.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories\n   \n  November 1952. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the\n   \n  U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Colonel Walsh had a great sense of humor. I hated his guts ever since\nwe went through the Academy together, but he had a great sense of humor.\n  \n \n  For example, he could have chosen a Second Looie for the job on Venus.\nHe might even have picked a Captain. But he liked me about as much as\nI liked him, and so he decided the job was just right for a Major. At\nleast, that's what he told me.\n  \n \n  I stood at attention before his desk in the Patrol Station. We were\nsomewhere in Area Two on Earth, takeoff point for any operations in\nSpace II. The duty was fine, and I liked it a lot. Come to think of\nit, the most I ever did was inspect a few defective tubes every now and\nthen. The rest was gravy, and Colonel Walsh wasn't going to let me get\nby with gravy.\n  \n \n  \"It will be a simple assignment, Major,\" he said to me, peering over\nhis fingers. He held them up in front of him like a cathedral.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It will involve finding one man, a Venusian native.\"\n  \n \n  I wanted to say, \"Then why the hell don't you send a green kid on\nthe job? Why me?\" Instead, I nodded and watched him playing with his\nfingers.\n  \n \n  \"The man is a trader of sorts. Rather intelligent.\" He paused, then\nadded, \"For a native, that is.\"\n  \n \n  I had never liked Walsh's attitude toward natives. I hadn't liked the\nway he'd treated the natives on Mars ever since he'd taken over there.\nWhich brought to mind an important point.\n  \n \n  \"I always figured Venus was under the jurisdiction of Space III, sir. I\nthought our activities were confined to Mars.\"\n  \n \n  He folded his fingers like a deck of cards and dropped them on his desk\nas if he were waiting for me to cut.\n  \n \n  \"Mmmm,\" he said, \"yes, that's true. But this is a special job. It so\nhappens this Venusian is the one man who can help us understand just\nwhat's happening on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  I tried to picture a Venusian understanding Mars and I didn't get very\nfar.\n  \n \n  \"He's had many dealings with the natives there,\" Walsh explained. \"If\nanyone can tell us the reasons for the revolt, he can.\"\n  \n \n  If Walsh really wanted to know the reasons for the revolt, I could give\nthem to him in one word: Walsh. I had to laugh at the way he called\nit \"revolt.\" It had been going on for six months now and we'd lost at\nleast a thousand men from Space II. Revolt.\n  \n \n  \"And this man is on Venus now?\" I asked for confirmation. I'd never\nbeen to Venus, being in Space II ever since I'd left the Moon run. It\nwas just like Walsh to ship me off to a strange place.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Major,\" he said. \"This man is on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  At the Academy he had called me Fred. That was before I'd reported\nhim for sleeping on Boiler Watch. He'd goofed off on a pile of uranium\nthat could've, and almost did, blow the barracks sky-high that night.\nHe still thought it was my fault, as if I'd done the wrong thing by\nreporting him. And now, through the fouled-up machinery that exists in\nany military organization, he outranked me.\n  \n \n  \"And the man's name, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Joe.\" A tight smile played on his face.\n  \n \n  \"Joe what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just Joe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walsh said. \"A native, you know. They rarely go in for more than\nfirst names. But then, it should be simple to find a man with a name\nlike Joe. Among the natives, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"A relatively simple assignment,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell me anything else about this man? Physical appearance?\nPersonal habits? Anything?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh seemed to consider this for a moment. \"Well, physically he's like\nany of the other Venusians, so I can't give you much help there. He\ndoes have a peculiar habit, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  I sighed. \"Well, it's not very much to go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll find him,\" Walsh said, grinning. \"I'm sure of it.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\nto greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n  \n \n  \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n  \n \n  He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n  \n \n  And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\nthe sun like a great silver bullet.\n  \n \n  \"What...?\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n  \n \n  The ship looked vaguely familiar. I noticed the crest of Space II near\nthe nose, and a lot of things became clear then. I also saw Walsh\nstanding near one of the huts, a stun gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Major,\" he called, almost cheerfully. The gun didn't look\ncheerful, though. It was pointed at my head.\n  \n \n  \"Fancy meeting you here, Colonel,\" I said, trying to match his\njoviality. Somehow it didn't quite come off.\n  \n \n  Joe was walking beside me, waving at the colonel, beaming all over with\nhappiness.\n  \n \n  \"I see you found your man,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I turned rapidly. Joe nodded and kept grinning, a grin that told me he\nwas getting a big kick out of all this. Like a kid playing a game.\n  \n \n  I faced Walsh again. \"Okay, what's it all about, pal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" Walsh corrected me. \"You mustn't forget to say Colonel,\n   \n   Major\n   \n  .\" He emphasized my rank, and he said it with a sort of ruthless\nfinality.\n  \n \n  I waited. I could see he was just busting to tell me how clever he'd\nbeen. Besides, there wasn't much I could do but wait. Not with Walsh\npointing the stun gun at my middle.\n  \n \n  \"We've come a long way since the Academy, haven't we, Major?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you mean in miles,\" I said, looking around at the plants, \"we sure\nhave.\"\n  \n \n  Walsh grinned a little. \"Always the wit,\" he said drily. And then the\nsmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\ngoing to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\nit'll rain tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\nthis. Another of those funny Terran games.\n  \n \n  \"You gave me a powerful handicap to overcome,\" Walsh said. \"I suppose I\nshould thank you, really.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're welcome,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't easy living down the disgrace you caused me.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was your own damn fault,\" I said. \"You knew what you were doing\nwhen you decided to cork off.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, Joe chuckled a little, enjoying the game immensely.\n  \n \n  \"You didn't have to report me,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  \"No? Maybe I should have forgotten all about it? Maybe I should have\nnudged you and served you orange juice? So you could do it again\nsometime and maybe blow up the whole damn Academy!\"\n  \n \n  Walsh was silent for a long time. When he spoke his voice was barely\naudible. The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\nlittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\nunimportant drama.\n  \n \n  I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n  \n \n  \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n  \n \n  \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\nunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\ngame, the fun?\n  \n \n  \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\nnever any trouble before you took command.\"\n  \n \n  \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n  \n \n  Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\nsay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\nOr maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n  \n \n  \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n  \n \n  \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\nsavages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\nThe perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the\ncolonel in puzzlement.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The relationship between the two characters starts off as one of business. Polk hires Joe to show him through the jungle. Joe is described as the best that there is, as he has lived there all his life. The two set off immediately for the jungle. As they journey through the forest, they begin to talk. Polk finds that he really enjoys the company of the Venusian. He likes that Joe always seems to be happy, and knows just what to say to cheer Polk up. He admires that he's so friendly to the locals, and immediately chats and laughs with them. Polk soon begins speaking freely to Joe, telling him about his past, as Joe would listen with the sympathetic ear. They found that they hsa a lot in common. This is why it was shocking to discover that Joe was in fact working for the Colonel the whole time, leading Polk right to him, and right to his death. ",
        "Summary_2": "The relationship between Major Polk and Joe initially starts out as strictly professional, with Joe guiding him through the jungle. As the trip progresses the two become companions, speaking to each other casually. Major Polk notes the passion Joe has for the jungle and how much he enjoys the trip, and says that Joe provides a refreshing and uplifting presence throughout the trip. The two eventually begin telling each other about their own lives, sharing stories and becoming friends.",
        "Summary_3": "At the beginning of their time together, Joe the guide seems to be very helpful to Polk. He recommends the supplies the Major would need to have a more comfortable journey in the jungle and they prove to be very useful during their adventure. During their time together, the Major observes that Joe seems to really enjoy his job. Days into their journey, the Major is feeling very dejected by not making any progress while Joe seems to be very content. It appears Joe is always in a good mood and is not influenced by the Major\u2019s emotionally discontent. The Major notes that the relationship started off as an employer and employee constrained type but it soon became very friendly and developed to where they were sharing stories with each other. The Major increasingly talks freely with his guide. \n\nWhile the relationship appeared to be very friendly during the journey in the jungle, it appears that Major Polk should have not trusted the guide. The guide appears to have already known that the Colonel would be in a clearing waiting with a stun gun for Polk as he laughs during the beginning of their encounter. It becomes clearer that Joe planned this with the Colonel, and thus betraying the friendly relationship he made with Polk. However, Joe\u2019s attitude begins to change as he responds with a confused look towards the Colonel\u2019s remarks about natives and Mars. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Major Polk has a formal relationship with his guide in the beginning. He would pay the guide, Joe, cigarettes and he would simply follow Joe as he finds his way through the jungle. Later, they started to talk more freely as the journey progresses. It was much less formal but more casual as the time went by. The Major starts to talk about Earth, the Academy, the Moon run, etc. And Joe is a great listener. Thus, they become friends. "

        "Query": "How did the Major discover that all the natives on the planet named Joe and why do they have a fondness for cigarettes in the story \"A Planet Named Joe\"?",
        "Article": "Captain Bransten was a mousey, unimpressive sort of man. He was wearing\na tropical tunic, but he still resembled a wilted lily more than he did\nan officer.\n  \n \n  \"Have a seat, Major,\" he offered. He reached for a cigarette box on the\ndesk and extended it to me. He coughed in embarrassment when he saw it\nwas empty. Quickly, he pressed a button on his desk and the door popped\nopen. A tall, blue Venusian stepped lithely into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" the Venusian asked.\n  \n \n  \"We're out of cigarettes, Joe,\" the Captain said. \"Will you get us\nsome, please?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure thing,\" the Venusian answered. He smiled broadly and closed the\ndoor behind him.\n  \n \n \n   Another Joe\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   Another damned Joe.\n   \n \n \n  \"They steal them,\" Captain Bransten said abruptly.\n  \n \n  \"Steal what?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Cigarettes. I sometimes think the cigarette is one of the few things\nthey like about Terran culture.\"\n  \n \n  So Walsh had taken care of that angle too.\n   \n   He does have a peculiar\nhabit, though. He has an affinity for Terran cigarettes.\n   \n  Cigarettes\nwas the tip I should have given; not solars.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I said, \"suppose we start at the beginning.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten opened his eyes wide. \"Sir?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"What's with all this Joe business? It may be a very original name but\nI think its popularity here is a little outstanding.\"\n  \n \n  Captain Bransten began to chuckle softly. I personally didn't think it\nwas so funny. I tossed him my withering Superior Officer's gaze and\nwaited for his explanation.\n  \n \n  \"I hadn't realized this was your first time on Venus,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Is there a local hero named Joe?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, no, nothing like that,\" he assured me. \"It's a simple culture, you\nknow. Not nearly as developed as Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see that,\" I said bitingly.\n  \n \n  \"And the natives are only now becoming acquainted with Terran culture.\nLots of enlisted men, you know.\"\n  \n \n  I began to get the idea. And I began to appreciate Walsh's doubtful\nancestry more keenly.\n  \n \n  \"It's impossible to tell exactly where it all started, of course,\"\nBransten was saying.\n  \n \n  I was beginning to get angry. Very angry. I was thinking of Walsh\nsitting back in a nice cozy foam chair back on Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Get to the point, Captain!\" I barked.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, sir,\" Bransten said, turning pale. I could see that the Captain\nwasn't used to entertaining Majors. \"The enlisted men. You know how\nthey are. They'll ask a native to do something and they'll call him\nJoe. 'Hey, Joe, give me a hand with this.' Or 'Listen, Joe, how'd you\nlike to earn some cigarettes?' Do you follow?\"\n  \n \n  \"I follow, all right,\" I said bitterly.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Bransten went on, \"that sort of thing mushrooms. The natives\nare a simple, almost childish people. It appealed to them\u2014the Joe\nbusiness, I mean. Now they're all Joe. They like it. That and the\ncigarettes.\"\n  \n \n  He cleared his throat and looked at me apologetically as if he were\npersonally responsible for Venusian culture. In fact, he looked as if\nhe were responsible for having put Venus in the heavens in the first\nplace.\n  \n \n  \"Do you understand, Major? Just a case of extended idiom, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  Just a case of extended\n   \n   idiot\n   \n  , I thought. An idiot on a wild goose\nchase a hell of a long way from home.\n  \n \n  \"I understand perfectly,\" I snapped. \"Where are my quarters?\"\n  \n \n  Bransten asked a Venusian named Joe to show me my quarters, reminding\nme that chow was at thirteen hundred. As I was leaving, the first\nVenusian came back with the cigarettes Bransten had ordered.\n  \n \n  I could tell by the look on his face that he probably had half a carton\nstuffed into his pockets. I shrugged and went to change into a tropical\ntunic.\n  \n \n  I called Earth right after chow. The Captain assured me that this sort\nof thing was definitely against regulations, but he submitted when I\ntwinkled my little gold leaf under his nose.\n  \n \n  Walsh's face appeared on the screen. He was smiling, looking like a fat\npussy cat.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Major?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"This man Joe,\" I said. \"Can you give me any more on him?\"\n  \n \n  Walsh's grin grew wider. \"Why, Major,\" he said, \"you're not having any\ndifficulties, are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" I snapped back. \"I just thought I'd be able to find him\na lot sooner if....\"\n  \n \n  \"Take your time, Major,\" Walsh beamed. \"There's no rush at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure you can do the job,\" Walsh cut in. \"I wouldn't have sent you\notherwise.\"\n  \n \n  Hell, I was through kidding around. \"Look....\"\n  \n \n  \"He's somewhere in the jungle, you know,\" Walsh said.\n  \n \n  I wanted to ram my fist into the screen, right smack up against those\nbig white teeth. Instead, I cut off the transmission and watched the\nsurprised look on his face as his screen went blank millions of miles\naway.\n  \n \n  He blinked at the screen, trying to realize I'd deliberately hung up on\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Polk!\" he shouted, \"can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled, saw the twisted hatred on his features, and then the screen\non my end went blank, too.\n  \n \n \n   He's somewhere in the jungle, you know.\n   \n \n \n  I thanked Captain Bransten for his hospitality and went back to my\nquarters.\n  \n \n  As I saw it, there were two courses for me to follow.\n  \n \n  One: I could say the hell with Walsh and Venus. That would mean hopping\nthe next ship back to Earth.\n  \n \n  It would also mean disobeying the direct order of a superior officer.\nIt might mean demotion, and it might mean getting bounced out of the\nService altogether.\n  \n \n  Two: I could assume there really was a guy name Joe somewhere in that\njungle, a Joe separate and apart from the other Joes on this planet, a\ntrader Joe who knew the Martians well. I could always admit failure, of\ncourse, and return empty handed. Mission not accomplished. Or, I might\nreally find a guy who was trader Joe.\n  \n \n  I made my decision quickly. I wanted to stay in the Service, and\nbesides Walsh may have been on the level for the first time in his\nlife. Maybe there was a Joe here who could help us on Mars. If there\nwas I'd try to find him. It was still a hell of a trick though.\n  \n \n  I cursed Walsh again and pushed the buzzer near my bed.\n  \n \n  A tall Venusian stepped into the room.\n  \n \n  \"Joe?\" I asked, just to be sure.\n  \n \n  \"Who else, boss?\" he answered.\n  \n \n  \"I'm trying to locate someone,\" I said. \"I'll need a guide to take me\ninto the jungle. Can you get me one?\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll cost you, boss,\" the Venusian said.\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two cartons of cigarettes at least.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who's the guide?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"How's the price sound?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, fine,\" I said impatiently. And the Captain had said they were\nalmost a childish people!\n  \n \n  \"His name is Joe,\" the Venusian told me. \"Best damn guide on the\nplanet. Take you anywhere you want to go, do anything you want to do.\nCourageous. Doesn't know the meaning of fear. I've known him to....\"\n  \n \n  \"Skip it,\" I said, cutting the promotion short. \"Tell him to show up\naround fifteen hundred with a complete list of what we'll need.\"\n  \n \n  The Venusian started to leave.\n  \n \n  \"And Joe,\" I said, stopping him at the door, \"I hope you're not\noverlooking your commission on the deal.\"\n  \n \n  His face broke into a wide grin. \"No danger of that, boss,\" he said.\n  \n \n  When he was gone I began figuring out a plan of action. Obviously, I'd\njust have to traipse through the jungle looking for a guy named Joe on\na planet where everyone was named Joe. Everybody, at least, but the\nCaptain, the small garrison attached to the Station, and me.\n  \n<doc-sep>Something was missing here. Natives. There were no natives rushing out\nto greet us. No cries of \"Cigarettes? Cigarettes?\" I caught up with Joe.\n  \n \n  \"What's the story?\" I whispered.\n  \n \n  He shrugged knowingly and continued walking.\n  \n \n  And then I saw the ship, nose pointing into space, catching the rays of\nthe sun like a great silver bullet.\n  \n \n  \"What...?\" I started.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Joe said, smiling.\n  \n \n  The ship looked vaguely familiar.

And then the\nsmile faded from his lips and his eyes took on a hard lustre. \"I'm\ngoing to kill you, you know.\" He said it as if he were saying, \"I think\nit'll rain tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Joe almost clapped his hands together with glee. He was really enjoying\nthis.

The heat was oppressive, as if it were concentrated on this\nlittle spot in the jungle, focusing all its penetration on a small,\nunimportant drama.\n  \n \n  I could hear Joe breathing beside me.\n  \n \n  \"I'm on my way out,\" Walsh rasped. \"Finished, do you understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" I said. And I meant it.\n  \n \n  \"This Mars thing. A terrible fix. Terrible.\"\n  \n \n  Beside me, a slight frown crossed Joe's face. Apparently he couldn't\nunderstand the seriousness of our voices. What had happened to the\ngame, the fun?\n  \n \n  \"You brought the Mars business on yourself,\" I told Walsh. \"There was\nnever any trouble before you took command.\"\n  \n \n  \"The natives,\" he practically shouted. \"They ... they....\"\n  \n \n  Joe caught his breath sharply, and I wondered what Walsh was going to\nsay about the natives. Apparently he'd realized that Joe was a native.\nOr maybe Joe's knife had something to do with it.\n  \n \n  \"What about the natives?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Walsh said. \"Nothing.\" He was silent for a while.\n  \n \n  \"A man of my calibre,\" he said then, his face grim. \"Dealing with\nsavages.\" He caught himself again and threw a hasty glance at Joe.\nThe perplexed frown had grown heavier on Joe's face. He looked at the\ncolonel in puzzlement.\n  \n<doc-sep>When we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\nboots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\nwould have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\nhigh boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n  \n \n  Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\nenjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\npleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\nsee three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\nhis head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\nThen he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\nimpenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\nto another village.\n  \n \n  Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\nhuts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n  \n \n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n  \n \n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n  \n \n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n  \n \n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n  \n \n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n  \n \n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n  \n \n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n  \n \n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n  \n \n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n  \n \n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n  \n \n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When the Major first arrives, he meets a man named Joe. He is a native. The Major thinks that he may have found his man already, but when he asks him if he's a trader, which would match the description that the colonel gave him, the native tells him that he's never traded anything in his life. He then keeps meeting natives, all of whom are named Joe. He asks the Captain why all the Venusians are named Joe. The captain explains that it's because when the men of the Terran space program arrived they used their slang with the locals, all calling them Joe. The men would tell them that if they did a job for them, they would get a pack of cigarettes. Because the Venusians had no names of their own before this, eventually the name \"Joe\" stuck, and everyone on the planet answered to it. They also kept an affinity for cigarettes. \n",
        "Summary_2": "When the Major lands on Venus, the first native he comes across introduces himself as Joe. Thinking that he had found the man he was assigned to find, the Major is pleased, but he then realizes that the man is not the right one. As the Major goes through Venus, he begins to notice that every Venusian native addresses the other as \"Joe\", and he realizes that they all share the same name. Captain Bransten then informs the Major of the phenomenon. When Terran men were enlisted on Venus, they would often call the natives \"Joe\" as a nickname, and reward them with cigarettes. Eventually, the natives caught on and began to adapt this behavior into their own culture. ",
        "Summary_3": "Once Major Polk meets the bartender, it is the second person that he meets on the planet named Joe. He realizes from this second encounter that the Colonel had set him up by sending him on an impossible mission. \n\nHis first hint that the natives like cigarettes are when the Captain offers him a cigarette as soon as he sits down in his office. The Captain says that the Venusians steal them during their conversation. The Captain explains that it is a part of the native Venusian culture to like cigarettes. He further realizes how important cigarettes are to natives when he is told the price for a guide can be paid with cigarette cartons. When they go through each village during their time in the jungle, the natives consistently ask for cigarettes. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The Major first encounters three Venusian natives, all with the name Joe. Even the server of Captain Bransten is named Joe. Thus he asks the Captain about this popular name. Because the enlisted man would call the native Joe, they like the name. Thus they are all called Joe. The Captain also reveals that the natives like the cigarettes because the enlisted men keep on asking them if they want to earn some cigarettes. The natives seem to only like these two things about Terran culture. This makes the Major realize that the tips given to one of the Joe that led him to the bar should have been cigarettes. Moreover, the Captain also notes that the natives like to steal the cigarettes."

It was\nticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used\nexactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of\nthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in\nhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost\nexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid\ndividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released\nagain.\n  \n \n  All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor\nbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.\nBut by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with\nbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid\nbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for\nthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing\nit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came\nspinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and\nagain the \"yo-yo\" snapped out.\n  \n \n  And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the\nSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the\nhand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to\nthe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had\nreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.\n  \n \n  Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This\ntime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\"\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.\nBob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish\ncommunication.\n  \n \n  Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the\ntelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in\nthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.\n  \n \n  \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared.\n\"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our\nstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   If\n   \n  you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless\nyou release the asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see you in Hades first!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\"\n  \n \n  He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at\nzero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie.\n  \n \n  For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a\ndoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size\nwith a strangled yell.\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in\nsuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as\nheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling\nprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it was\napparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,\ntheir ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space for\na second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons from\nits still-intact jets.\n  \n \n  The battle was won!\n  \n<doc-sep>It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,\nfastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's\nnarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to\ntwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and\nreinforced.\n  \n \n  The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob\nParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of\ncosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into\nstrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the\nend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy\nsnapped his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the\nSaylor brothers are where we calculated!\"\n  \n \n  They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had\ndiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid\non their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the\nMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to\nthe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred\nthousand miles from Earth!\n  \n \n  \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within\nnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was\nspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere\nvaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship\nwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant\nsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.\n  \n \n  Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\"\n  \n \n  Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then\nsent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten\nmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the\n\"yo-yo.\"\n  \n \n  There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,\nscornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm\nthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,\nfor Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal's\nlittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!\n  \n \n  It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid\nlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a\nfantastic spinning cannon ball.\n  \n \n  \"It's going to hit!\"\n  \n \n  The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship\nreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of\ncompleting its mission.

Fairly quickly, they find one that looks perfect. The men land on the asteroid, and Bob deploys his atomic-whirl spectroscope to test it. Suddenly, a beautiful woman interrupts him and demands that they leave the asteroid. She pulls out her spasticizer gun before telling them that they can have it in a month after she\u2019s gone. Bob explains that they are desperate, but the girl retorts that her fate is worse than death if she leaves.\n\nSuddenly, the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship appears, and Bob tells the girl that they have to fight this enemy together.

Bob had invented this service, but his business is suffering thanks to strong-arming by their main competitor, the Saylor Brothers. They need to find Mr. Burnside's asteroid because the payout of $550,000 will save their business. When Bob and Queazy discover an appropriate asteroid, they land and survey the surface to check its dimensions and mineral composition. However, they are interrupted by a beautiful young woman who confirms the composition of the asteroid but demands they leave at once or else she will alert the Interplanetary Commission that they have broken the law. When Bob sees her dumbbell-shaped spaceship, he realizes she comes from wealth and becomes obstinate; he shares with her the importance of this asteroid to his business. While the woman acknowledges his situation, she says if she leaves the asteroid, she will face \"a fate worse than death!\" As they finish their conversation, the Saylor Brothers' ship arrives, and Bob informs the woman that they must stick together to stand against them. Bob argues with Wally and Billy Saylor and eventually he and Queazy attack the two brothers. In the ensuing fight, the Saylors use the woman's paralyzing spasticizer to disable the three rivals and leave them scattered and stranded to die in space.

Having weddings on asteroids in backyards had become a fad among the richest people on Earth.\nWhen they land on the asteroid, they put on spacesuits and begin exploring and testing its composition. They\u2019re startled by a woman who is squatting on the asteroid and claiming she is protected by law to remain there. She is certain about not wanting the asteroid to move from its position, and even pulls a weapon (a spasticizer) on Bob to try to prove her point when he tries to plead with her that his livelihood depends on them taking the asteroid back to Earth. Just as Bob and Queazy were turning to leave the asteroid, the Saylor brothers landed on it.\nThe Saylor brothers were a rival operation to Bob and Queazy, and Bob says they are known for being rough to get their way. They landed on the asteroid with three other men, claimed they also had a direct order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and began an attack on Bob and Queazy. Bob made a diversion with the woman\u2019s paralyzing weapon, Queazy threw Billy Saylor off the asteroid into space, and Wally Saylor shot the weapon out of Bob\u2019s hand. \nBob was unconscious after the fight and woke up spinning in outer space running out of oxygen. With his last breath he called for Queazy on the intercom and was swiftly rescued by both he and the woman and revived to life. The woman revealed herself to be Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter,  Starre Lowenthal. She was squatting on the asteroid to try to stop its delivery to Earth. She told her grandfather that she would only marry the man he set her up with, Mac, if it was atop this exact asteroid - thinking that there was no way it was possible for it to be found, and if by small chance it was she would scare those people away.\n \nBob tells Starre they can still intercept the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship since they have to take a long slow orbit back to Earth while his ship can go direct because it\u2019s not towing an asteroid. Along the five day journey to Earth, Bob and Starre fall in love with each other, but Starre seems determined that she would have to keep her promise to marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered. They hook up Starre\u2019s dumbbell shaped spaceship that they are towing like a yo-yo and use it to bludgeon the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship, causing them to release the asteroid and jet away into outer space, leaving Bob, Queasy and Starre in possession.\n",

The client who requested an asteroid this size wants it for a wedding in his backyard by 11:30 am on June 2; otherwise, the order is void. Parker started the \u201casteroid in your backyard\u201d promotion, but since then, other companies have been offering the same service.

Parker and Queazy locate the perfect asteroid that meets the exact specifications of the request, only to find that someone else, a beautiful young woman, already has laid claim to it. She orders them to leave and threatens to report them to the Interplanetary Commission or to shoot them with her spasticizer.

It was\nticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used\nexactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of\nthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in\nhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost\nexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid\ndividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released\nagain.\n  \n \n  All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor\nbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.\nBut by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with\nbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid\nbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for\nthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing\nit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came\nspinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and\nagain the \"yo-yo\" snapped out.\n  \n \n  And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the\nSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the\nhand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to\nthe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had\nreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.\n  \n \n  Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This\ntime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\"\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.\nBob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish\ncommunication.\n  \n \n  Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the\ntelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in\nthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.\n  \n \n  \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared.\n\"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our\nstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   If\n   \n  you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless\nyou release the asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see you in Hades first!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\"\n  \n \n  He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at\nzero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie.\n  \n \n  For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a\ndoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size\nwith a strangled yell.\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in\nsuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as\nheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling\nprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it was\napparent that the Saylor brothers had given up. Like a wounded terrier,\ntheir ship shook itself free of the asteroid, hung in black space for\na second, then vanished with a flaming puff of released gravitons from\nits still-intact jets.\n  \n \n  The battle was won!\n  \n<doc-sep>It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,\nfastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's\nnarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to\ntwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and\nreinforced.\n  \n \n  The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob\nParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of\ncosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into\nstrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the\nend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy\nsnapped his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the\nSaylor brothers are where we calculated!\"\n  \n \n  They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had\ndiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid\non their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the\nMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to\nthe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred\nthousand miles from Earth!\n  \n \n  \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within\nnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was\nspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere\nvaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship\nwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant\nsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.\n  \n \n  Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\"\n  \n \n  Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then\nsent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten\nmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the\n\"yo-yo.\"\n  \n \n  There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,\nscornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm\nthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,\nfor Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal's\nlittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!\n  \n \n  It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid\nlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a\nfantastic spinning cannon ball.\n  \n \n  \"It's going to hit!\"\n  \n \n  The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship\nreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of\ncompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back\nup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue\nsparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic\nclamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and\nfive men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood\nsurveying the three who faced them.\n  \n \n  The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their\ndarkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.\n  \n \n  \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you\nthink of this situation Billy?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his\nheels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have\nto take steps.\"\n  \n \n  The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling\nlaughter.\n  \n \n  Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an\nethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled\u2014and his smile remained fixed,\ndangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came\nabreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave\nback a step, as he saw their intentions.\n  \n \n  \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll\nreport you to the Interplanetary Commission!\"\n  \n \n  It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of\nthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of\nthe girl's spasticizer\u2014a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained\nchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at\nQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He\nhurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid\nand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.\n  \n \n  At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his\nhand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked\nthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something\ncrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar\nplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,\nand his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,\nbefore the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete\ndarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage\u2014then a scream of pain.\n  \n \n  What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,\nhe didn't care. Then\u2014lights out.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Saylor brothers, Wally and Billy, are Bob Parker\u2019s enemies. Bob was the first person with the unique idea to sell asteroids to wealthy people on earth, and his business would have been very successful if the Saylor brothers did not poach his idea and begin stealing his clients. Bob worries about the Saylor brothers from the beginning of the story, and he acknowledges that they do not always play by the rules. If Wally and Billy can make a buck by inconveniencing or cheating someone else, they will do it. The brothers are not only intimidating in terms of their business prowess; they are also described as giant when compared to Bob. \n\nQueasy and Bob have a legitimate order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and they have no idea that the Saylor brothers have received the same order. Yet, they still worry that somehow, someway, their enemies will hear about the potential to make half a million dollars and try to steal their opportunity out from under them. Within moments of setting eyes on their spaceship, Bob tells Starre that they have to fight the Saylor brothers together. He doesn\u2019t know her at all, and she actually just pulled a gun on him, but he so deeply mistrusts Wally and Billy that it\u2019s worth it to take a chance on Starre.\n\nOf course, Bob turns out to be right. The second the Saylor brothers get a chance to potentially kill Bob, Queazy, and Starre, they take it. Bob floats in space, unconscious, for several weeks before Starre eventually finds Queazy and Bob, and they give him oxygen and food. Bob is truly close to death before his friends save him in the knick of time, and the Saylor brothers would be perfectly fine with that outcome. \n\nWally and Billy give Bob all the motivation in the world to try and steal the asteroid back, and Bob is determined to catch up with his rivals and make it work somehow. When he comes up with his yo-yo idea using Starre\u2019s ship, he shows zero empathy for the Saylor brothers. During his attempts to retrieve the rock, he seriously damages the brothers\u2019 ship, and they have the gall to call him and attempt to make him feel guilty about their desperate state. Bob, however, cannot be swayed. He knows that he found the asteroid first and that the brothers purposefully cast him out into space to die. His determination saves the day when the Saylor brothers are forced to dispatch Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Wally and Billy Saylor are boorish twin brothers who operate a company, Saylor & Saylor, that competes with The Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Company operated by Bob and Queazy. The Saylors have cashed in on Bob's \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea like many other companies on Earth, only they have been more successful. Thanks to their lack of business scruples, the Saylors have nearly put Bob and Queazy out of business. Because of this, Bob worries about them taking the asteroid that will net his company $550,000 if they catch wind of his arrangement. Unfortunately, the Saylors have also been hired by the same wealthy client that hired Bob and Queazy because the asteroid request was so unusual and specific, the client wanted to make sure it could be found in time for his granddaughter's wedding. Soon after Bob and Queazy meet the granddaughter, who is making temporary camp on the asteroid to avoid getting married, the Saylors arrive and paralyze the three of them in order to take the asteroid back to Earth and cash in for themselves. After they awaken and reunite, Bob, Queazy, and the granddaughter Starre, race after the Saylors and use Starre's ship as a yo-yo projectile. They damage the Saylors' ship and threaten to kill them so that they will release the asteroid. The Saylors threaten to call the Interplanetary Commission, but Bob is persistent, and he slams their ship again, causing them to give up the asteroid.",
        "Summary_3": "The Saylor brothers are the antagonists of the story. They have an interplanetary moving company in competition with Bob and Queazy, and are known to be violent in getting their way. \nBecause Mr. Burnside was so desperate to have his granddaughter\u2019s wedding go on, he put the order out to both companies for this exact asteroid, causing the Saylor brothers to come into conflict with Bob and Queazy (who were also trying to deliver it to Earth), and Starre (who was desperate for it to not be delivered to Earth since she didn\u2019t want to get married). The Saylor brothers and three other men violently force all of them off the asteroid and into outer space to die and hurry off to Earth with the asteroid, which is the climax of the story.\nUltimately, Bob, Queasy, and Starre get justice by retrieving the asteroid after they intercept the Saylor brothers and attack their ship using a yo-yo method with Starre\u2019s spaceship they are towing, forcing the Saylor brothers to retreat into outer space.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Saylor brothers provide the conflict and competition that drives Bob Parker and Queazy to search the galaxy for an asteroid with the particular specifications Burnside requests. The Saylors are less-than-honest competitors with Bob\u2019s Interplanetary and Hauling Company. While Bob Parker came up with the \u201casteroid in your backyard\u201d concept, his competitors, especially the Saylors, soon offer the same service. Bob\u2019s company is on the verge of collapse and must fill Mr. Burnside\u2019s order if it is to survive. In desperation, they take on Burnsides\u2019s almost impossible order. When they find the asteroid, it is occupied by a young girl who turns out to be Burnside\u2019s granddaughter. As they talk with her to try to negotiate for the asteroid, the Saylor brothers arrive, trying to take the asteroid. In the fighting that ensues, the Saylors knock Queazy, Bob, and Starre unconscious, leaving them for dead, and take the asteroid. Bob is unconscious for three weeks, and when he comes to, he is down to five pounds of oxygen. Fortunately, Starre and Queazy find him and save him. Then they set sail for tracking down the Saylor brothers. When they find them, they attack the Saylors\u2019 ship with Starre\u2019s ship, using it like a yo-yo. The Saylors contact Bob to let him know they are losing air and that he is going to kill them; however, they refuse to turn over the asteroid. When Bob hits them again with the yo-yo, they finally give up, release the asteroid, and sail away.\n"

The fact that Starre is curt and demanding does not change his innate attraction to her. Bob does not get offended by Starre\u2019s refusal to hold a real conversation with him; he just keeps trying. Even Starre\u2019s decision to pull out her spasticizer and aim it at the men doesn\u2019t truly deter Bob. He continues to try and convince her that his economic well-being depends on the asteroid. The only time he becomes annoyed with the beautiful girl is when he sets eyes on her perfect ship and assumes that she is already plenty wealthy. Still, he chooses not to attack nor namecall, he simply uses reason to convince her that the asteroid is more useful to him.\n\nMoments later, when the Saylor brothers show up at Starre\u2019s asteroid, Starre already has a good feeling about Bob and Queazy. That\u2019s why, when Wally and Billy attack the trio, it is Starre that uses her dumbbell-shaped ship to locate the men and save their lives. Bob and Queazy end up owing everything to the beautiful brunette. Without her, their corpses would be floating through space. \n\nThe first time that Bob sees Starre after she saves his life, he notices the paper flower in her hair and the pretty blue outfit she\u2019s wearing. He can\u2019t take his eyes off of her, and his feelings towards her do not change when she admits that she essentially set them up. She is Mr. Burnside\u2019s granddaughter, and she never intended to let anyone find the perfect asteroid and haul it back to earth. She set up a deal with her grandfather that she knew he couldn\u2019t follow through with. Starre does not want to marry Mac, the man that she\u2019s engaged to, and that\u2019s why she was living on the perfect asteroid that Mr. Burnside ordered from Bob and the Saylor brothers. \n\nAlthough Bob has every right to be angry with Starre, he completely falls in love with her on their mission to recollect the asteroid that the Saylor brothers stole from them. He tries to convince her not to marry Mac, but she acknowledges that she must hold up her end of the bargain with her grandfather. Unfortunately, Bob can\u2019t have it both ways. If he wants to save his company from going under, he needs the asteroid, and if he fulfills Mr. Burnside\u2019s order, Starre must marry Mac. \n",

Although Bob doesn't know this yet, Starre wants to stay there for a month in order to avoid having to get married to her grandfather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mac and send away anyone who might come and try to take the asteroid back to her grandfather. Starre and Bob mostly have a strained relationship until they are both attacked by the Saylor Brothers and left for dead; Starre proves she is more than the spoiled, rich girl Bob thinks she is when she uses her own ship to save Queazy and then Bob. As they track the Saylor Brothers, Bob slowly falls in love with Starre, who seems to have an interest in Bob, too; however, she feels compelled by her obligation to her grandfather to marry Mac. Although Bob is unhappy that she cannot reciprocate his feelings, he still devises a plan to take down the Saylors and promises Starre they will come up with a plan to help her avoid the marriage.

She thought she had the perfect plan to get out of it, but it had all fallen apart when the Saylor brothers were also given the order for the asteroid by her eager grandfather wanting to see the marriage go through. \nDuring the five day journey back to Earth together to intercept the Saylor brothers, Starre and Bob fall in love with each other. Starre provides the idea to make a yo-yo out of her spaceship, and they work happily together with Queazy to get the work done. Bob and Starre are equally elated when the Saylor brothers release the asteroid, though it is unclear what the future for them together holds.\n",
        "Summary_4": "When Bob first sees Starre, he is struck by her beauty, but despite her plight, he is determined to take the asteroid to Earth and collect her grandfather\u2019s fee that he needs so badly. Initially, Starre is antagonistic to Bob and Queazy because she is staying on the asteroid to claim it and prevent anyone from taking it. If her grandfather gets hold of it, she will have to marry Mac, a fate she considers worse than death. After the Saylors\u2019 attack on all three of them, Starre and Queazy rescue Bob just as his oxygen is running out. They save his life, and it isn\u2019t long before Bob is in love with her. Starre realizes this, and just before Bob can profess his feelings, she stops him because she will have to keep her word and marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered on time. When Bob devises a way to use Starre\u2019s ship like a yo-yo to attack the Saylors\u2019 ship, he also tells Starre that they will work on a solution to her problem, too. It seems that Bob will try to collect Burnsides\u2019 payment for delivery of the asteroid but somehow prevent Starre from having to marry Mac. \n\n"

Not in his wildest imaginings had\nhe thought they would actually find what they were looking for.\n  \n \n  \"Cut the drive!\" he yelled at Queazy. \"I've got it, right on the nose.\nQueazy, my boy, can you imagine it? We're in the dough. Not only that,\nwe're rich! Come here!\"\n  \n \n  Queazy discharged their tremendous inertia into the motive-tubes in\nsuch a manner that the big, powerful ship was moving at the same rate\nas the asteroid below\u201447.05 miles per second. He came slogging back\nexcitedly, put his eyes to the eyepiece. He gasped, and his big body\nshook with joyful ejaculations.\n  \n \n  \"She checks down to the last dimension,\" Bob chortled, working with\nslide-rule and logarithm tables. \"Now all we have to do is find out if\nshe's made of tungsten, iron, quartz crystals, and cinnabar! But there\ncouldn't be two asteroids of that shape anywhere else in the Belt, so\nthis has to be it!\"\n  \n \n  He jerked a badly crumpled ethergram from his pocket, smoothed it out,\nand thumbed his nose at the signature.\n  \n \n  \"Whee! Mr. Andrew S. Burnside, you owe us five hundred and fifty\nthousand dollars!\"\n  \n \n  Queazy straightened. A slow, likeable smile wreathed his tanned face.\n\"Better take it easy,\" he advised, \"until I land the ship and we use\nthe atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of the\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have it your way,\" Bob Parker sang, happily. He threw the ethergram\nto the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy\u2014so\ncalled because his full name was Quentin Zuyler\u2014dropped the ship\nstraight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped it\ntight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, brought\nout two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, with\nstar-powdered infinity spread to all sides.\n  \n \n  In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia,\none of the richest men in the world, still lay on the deck-plates. It\nwas addressed to: Mr. Robert Parker, President Interplanetary Hauling &\nMoving Co., 777 Main Street, Satterfield City, Fontanaland, Mars. The\nethergram read:\n  \n \n \n   Received your advertising literature a week ago. Would like to state\nthat yes I would like an asteroid in my back yard. Must meet following\nspecifications: 506 feet length, long enough for wedding procession;\n98 feet at base, tapering to 10 feet at apex; 9-12 feet thick; topside\nsmooth-plane, underside rough-plane; composed of iron ore, tungsten,\nquartz crystals, and cinnabar. Must be in my back yard before 11:30\nA.M. my time, for important wedding June 2, else order is void. Will\npay $5.00 per ton.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job,\nfastening two huge supra-steel \"eyes\" onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's\nnarrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to\ntwo winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and\nreinforced.\n  \n \n  The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob\nParker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of\ncosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into\nstrange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the\nend of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy\nsnapped his fingers.\n  \n \n  \"It'll work!\" His gray eyes showed satisfaction. \"Now, if only the\nSaylor brothers are where we calculated!\"\n  \n \n  They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had\ndiscovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid\non their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the\nMoon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to\nthe still bigger asteroid\u2014inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred\nthousand miles from Earth!\n  \n \n  \"We have to work fast,\" Bob stammered, sweating. He got within\nnaked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was\nspread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere\nvaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship\nwas two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant\nsky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.\n  \n \n  Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. \"Go to it, Bob!\"\n  \n \n  Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then\nsent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten\nmiles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the\n\"yo-yo.\"\n  \n \n  There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But,\nscornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm\nthe oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought,\nfor Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero\u2014and Starre Lowenthal's\nlittle ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!\n  \n \n  It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid\nlengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a\nfantastic spinning cannon ball.\n  \n \n  \"It's going to hit!\"\n  \n \n  The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship\nreached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of\ncompleting its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back\nup the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue\nsparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic\nclamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and\nfive men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood\nsurveying the three who faced them.\n  \n \n  The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their\ndarkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.\n  \n \n  \"A pleasure,\" drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. \"What do you\nthink of this situation Billy?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's obvious,\" drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his\nheels, \"that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have\nto take steps.\"\n  \n \n  The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling\nlaughter.\n  \n \n  Bob Parker's gorge rose. \"Scram,\" he said coldly. \"We've got an\nethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"So have we,\" Wally Saylor smiled\u2014and his smile remained fixed,\ndangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came\nabreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave\nback a step, as he saw their intentions.\n  \n \n  \"We got here first,\" he snapped harshly. \"Try any funny stuff and we'll\nreport you to the Interplanetary Commission!\"\n  \n \n  It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of\nthese men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of\nthe girl's spasticizer\u2014a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained\nchance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at\nQueazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He\nhurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid\nand threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.\n  \n \n  At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his\nhand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked\nthe smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something\ncrushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing at his solar\nplexus. He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back,\nand his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely,\nbefore the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete\ndarkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage\u2014then a scream of pain.\n  \n \n  What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick,\nhe didn't care. Then\u2014lights out.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Bob and Queazy are willing to risk their lives to try and get the asteroid back from Wally and Billy Saylor because their economic survival depends on it. Bob is the president of Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., and his rivals, the Saylor brothers, have put his business in serious jeopardy. Although his novel idea to sell asteroids to wealthy earthmen originally made him some cash, it wasn\u2019t long before other companies got wind of his genius idea and started offering the same service. If the Saylor brothers keep beating Bob and Queazy to the punch, the men will no longer be in business.\n\nWhen Starre demands that Bob and Queazy leave her asteroid since she is the common law owner, both men try to explain to her why they desperately need the rock. The potential to make $550,000 means everything to Bob because his failure to secure that capital means that he and Queazy will lose their business and slave away for the rest of their lives as glass factory workers. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Bob Parker created the idea of the \"asteroid in your back yard\", and since then it has become a fad sweeping Earth. As a result, a number of moving companies have emerged as competitors to Bob's Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., primarily Saylor & Saylor. The Saylor brothers engage in unscrupulous business practices and have crippled Bob's business to the point of desperation. Therefore, Bob and his business partner Queazy need to fulfill Mr. Burnside's extremely specific wedding-asteroid request for his granddaughter; successful completion of the order would net their company $550,000 and save them from financial ruin. ",
        "Summary_3": "This mission to secure Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid is so important to Bob and Queazy because it will pay them $5.00 per ton, which they estimate will net them $550,000. They look for it for three weeks before finding it, demonstrating how valuable this job is to them.\nSecuring the asteroid is also a point of pride for them, as they feel their business is threatened by the rival Saylor brothers, and the success of this mission would demonstrate their claim in the business of interplanetary deliveries.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Securing Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid is critical for Bob\u2019s business to survive. He is having financial difficulty due to stiff competition, particularly from the Saylor brothers. The $550,000 from Mr. Burnside will help prevent his company from going bankrupt and going out of business. Burnside\u2019s order for an asteroid in his back yard is quite specific: it must be 506 feet long, 98 feet at the base and tapering to 10 feet at the apex, 9-12 feet thick, a smooth plane on the top side and a rough plane underneath. It must also be composed of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar. It has to be in Burnside\u2019s back yard before 11:30 am on June 2. The order is so specific that normally Bob and Queazy would not have accepted it, but since the business is about to fold, they are desperate and willing to try to fill it. When they find the asteroid in just three weeks, it seems they have had an incredible stroke of good luck, until the Saylor brothers show up to claim it, too. Filling the Burnsides order is a matter of life or death for Bob and Queazy\u2019s company, and they are prepared to do everything humanly possible to collect the asteroid and take to Earth.\n\n"

It was\nticklish work completely to nullify the \"yo-yo's\" speed. Bob used\nexactly the same method of catching the \"yo-yo\" on the blunt nose of\nthe ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in\nhis glove\u2014namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost\nexactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid\ndividends, for the \"yo-yo\" came to rest snugly, ready to be released\nagain.\n  \n \n  All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor\nbrothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on.\nBut by the time the \"yo-yo\" was flung at them again, this time with\nbetter calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid\nbetween them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for\nthe asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing\nit, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came\nspinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and\nagain the \"yo-yo\" snapped out.\n  \n \n  And this time\u2014collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the\nSaylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the\nhand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to\nthe principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had\nreceived a mere dent in its starboard half.\n  \n \n  Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, \"Attaboy, Bob! This\ntime we'll knock 'em out of the sky!\"\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly.\nBob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish\ncommunication.\n  \n \n  Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the\ntelaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in\nthe plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.\n  \n \n  \"What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?\" he roared.\n\"You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our\nstern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Bob drawled, \"you're getting the idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!\" screamed Saylor.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   If\n   \n  you're alive,\" Bob snarled wrathfully. \"And you won't be unless\nyou release the asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see you in Hades first!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hades,\" remarked Bob coldly, \"here you come!\"\n  \n \n  He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at\nzero. And the \"yo-yo\" went on its lone, destructive sortie.\n  \n \n  For a fraction of a second Wally Saylor exhibited the countenance of a\ndoomed man. In the telaudio plate, he whirled, and diminished in size\nwith a strangled yell.\n  \n \n  The \"yo-yo\" struck again, but Bob Parker maneuvered its speed in\nsuch a manner that it struck in the same place as before, but not as\nheavily, then rebounded and came spinning back with perfect, sparkling\nprecision. And even before it snugged itself into its berth, it was\napparent that the Saylor brothers had given up.

But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that.

Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach.

        "Summary_1": "After studying for six years, Ben sits at his U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight graduation. Next to Ben is Mickey, his best friend who also plans to go into deep space. Ben is an orphan, and he wonders if the only person he invited, Charlie Taggart, is there. Ben met Charlie, an accomplished spaceman, when he was a boy, and Charlie took him under his wing. When Ben connects with Charlie after the ceremony, he worries about his gaunt face and terrible cough. \n\nBen then meets Laura, Mickey\u2019s sister. There is an undeniable and instant connection between them. Charlie only has 24 hours to spend with Ben before he has to report back for duty, and although he wants to have some drinks with Ben alone, Laura invites them both over, and Ben can\u2019t help but say yes.\n\nMoments later, Dean Dawson reminds Ben about an offer to teach at the Academy. Mickey takes this opportunity to admit to Ben that he will be working as a Supervisor at White Sands Port. Ben is disappointed to hear that Mickey has chosen to live a boring life, but Mickey insists that he does not want to die in his 30s. \n\nAfter dinner at Mickey\u2019s house, Laura and Ben take a walk together. Laura asks about Charlie\u2019s life before he was a spaceman, but Ben doesn\u2019t have answers for her. He doesn\u2019t know anything about Charlie\u2019s past. Ben looks at Laura and realizes that she has feelings for him, too. When she suggests that a career in deep space may not be worth what Ben would be leaving behind, Ben finds himself at a crossroads. Should he live his dream  or should he settle down with the woman he loves and live an ordinary life?\n\nThe next morning, Charlie gives Ben an old tin with souvenirs inside, and then tells him to meet him at the Space Rat, a little cafe on Mars, when he gets there. Ben still hasn\u2019t chosen a career path and decides to stay with Mickey and Laura and their family until he does. He experiences forty days of happiness with his love, Laura, and forty nights of indecision about which career to choose. Ben asks Laura to marry him, but she says she can\u2019t unless he decides to stay on earth. \n\nThe next day, Ben receives a message informing him that Charlie has died from lung-rot, a disease he got in space. When Ben looks in Charlie\u2019s tin and finds useless trinkets, he decides  to take the teaching job so that he does not live a similarly meaningless life. However, hours later, he looks in the tin again and finds a wedding ring. Ben surmises that Charlie wanted to tell him to take the chance on space, and he believes it\u2019s the right decision to make. He can\u2019t live his life without knowing what the stars look like, even if that means he can\u2019t have Laura too. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Spacemen Die at Home is a story in the form of a letter written from Ben to Laura, explaining his decision to leave her behind on Earth. It all begins in June of 1965 in New Mexico when the first class of the U.S. Academy of Interplentary Flight is finally graduating after six years. These 25 students were trained to take on interplanetary flight and space exploration, so they can continue to discover the outer planets. Robert Chandler gave a speech detailing why these brave men were so important to modern society, as women were not allowed to become space explorers. Mickey and Ben, graduates and friends, sat next to each other during the ceremony. Mickey struggles to find his family in the crowd, and Ben reveals that he was orphaned after his parents died in a rocket crash. A spaceman named Charlie Taggart (Stardust Charlie) raised him instead. He was one of the oldest spacemen ever, having travelled for nearly 25 years, and was the Chief Jetman on the Lunar Lady. \nAfter the ceremony, Ben runs into Charlie and sees how much he\u2019s aged in just a year. He looks ill and drugged, but he still asks Ben to celebrate with him. Before Ben can respond, Mickey and his sister Laura came up to him. He is instantly attracted to her and feels a connection. Ben was supposed to spend the weekend with Mickey and his family, but now that Charlie\u2019s in town he feels conflicted. Both Ben and Charlie decide to join them, despite Charlie not being a family man. Dean Dawson, an academy professor, approaches Ben and reminds him of his job offer at the Academy. Ben turns him down laughing, until Mickey reveals that he is not going to space anymore. Instead, he\u2019ll be the Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Sport. After an awkward dinner together, Laura and Ben went stargazing and spoke of Charlie and the draw of space. Laura hints at loving Ben, but doesn\u2019t say it outright. Charlie left the next day, but left Ben some of his possessions. He knows he hasn\u2019t got much time in this universe, but he goes back to Mars anyways. \nWith several job options to choose from, Ben decides to stay at Mickey\u2019s house for the timebeing. He stays for 40 days and nights, spending much of his time with Laura. He asked Laura to marry him, but she says she\u2019d only marry him if he were a teacher, not a spaceman. Ben was faced with a serious conundrum. The next day he received word that Charlges Taggart died of lung-rot, and Ben broke down. Ben sifted through Charlie\u2019s possessions and decided to take on a the teaching gig for Dawson. However, after looking through the box again, he found a wedding ring. Seeing himself in Charlie, Ben decided to fly to the stone cafe on Mars called the Space Rat where Stardust Charlie said he\u2019d be waiting for him. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Nearly the entire story is a recollection of the narrator, Ben, as he writes a letter to his love, Laura, who he is leaving behind for his dreams of becoming a spaceman.\nIn June of 1995, Ben and Mickey are sitting together during their graduation ceremony from the first class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, looking at out at the audience for their guests. Mickey is cheerful and generally accepts the world with a smile. Ben\u2019s invited guest, Charlie Taggart, is a pioneering spaceman of 25 years who he thinks of as a parental figure since his parents died in a strato-jet crash when he was four. Ben and Mickey both spot their guests, and there is a contrasting moment between Ben\u2019s orphaned upbringing and Mickey\u2019s family.\nCharlie looks different from the other guests, with scars on his face, and a missing button on his suit - known for doing things his own way. Charlie is a veteran of the explorer Everson's first trip to the Moon, and he had spent his life in space. Mickey introduces Ben to his sister, Laura, after the ceremony. Since Mickey has invited Ben to spend the weekend with them, Laura goes a step further to also invite Charlie, which they both accept. Charlie leaves after one night, gifting Ben a tin box of \u201csouvenirs\u201d from his life, foreshadowing his imminent passing.\nAlthough Ben and Mickey both graduated from the school of interplanetary flight, they have both been offered terrestrial jobs. Ben was offered a job teaching Astrogation at the Academy by Dean Dawson. No doubt very prestigious, but Ben dreams of being the first to visit new planets with Mickey. Mickey awkwardly reveals he had a change of heart, citing that spacemen have short lives because of the demands and danger. Mickey was offered a Cargo Supervisor role at the White Sands Port that he accepted because he will \u201clive a lot longer\u201d there.\nBen is deeply uncertain about his future, accepting Mickey\u2019s offer to stay until he figures it out. During the forty days and forty nights he spends with them he falls in love with Laura and contemplates a family life on Earth with her - even proposing marriage to her - but his desire to be a spaceman remains a barrier to them being together. After Ben learns of Charlie\u2019s death (at \u201chome\u201d on Mars), he remembers the box Charlie gave him. At first he thinks it\u2019s pitiful that there are trinkets in place of the family Charlie might have had on Earth, and makes a decision to take the teaching job and remain on Earth in a safe life with Laura. \nProcessing the contents of the box further, seeing a wedding ring Charlie left for the marriage he couldn\u2019t have due to his life in space, Ben is inspired to again chase his dream in space. He leaves behind the wedding ring and a note (the story) for Laura to find in the morning when he is gone.\n",
        "Summary_4": "This story is a letter from Ben to Laura, and starts with Ben's retelling of his graduation day from the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, with inspiring quotes from the guest speaker about how important spacemen are to society. Ben and his friend Mickey looked around for the one person Ben had invited: Charlie Taggart, aka \"Spaceman Charlie\". They spotted him, and Ben was relieved; the three of them went out afterwards to celebrate along with Mickey's sister, Laura. Ben explained that he'd been offered a teaching job at The Academy but wanted to join an exploratory crew. After getting to the helicopter, Ben eventually met Laura and Charlie's parents--simple people who were happy to live on Earth and not be going anywhere any time soon. Charlie did his best to interact with these new people, even though he told some disturbing stories. Laura and Ben headed to the terrace to look for rockets and talked about Charlie; Laura had a lot of questions about his past. They shared a quiet moment, appreciating each other, before Laura made a comment about the desire to go to the stars might be a disappointment: if they weren't what they seemed, maybe they would never be enough. She asked Ben if he really wanted to give up everything he could have, making Ben sad. The next morning, Charlie returned to work and left a box of belongings with Ben; it was only then when Ben became worried about the coughing he'd noticed over the past day, and his glassy eyes and stiff movements. Before they could talk, Charlie was gone. Later, in Mickey's room, Ben reflected on how his childhood was different from that of other children, after his parents died in a rocket crash. It was after this that he realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to stay or to go, and agreed to stay with Mickey's family until he made a decision about what to do. He spent most of the time with Laura, and after forty days of this he proposed to her, prompting her to ask what he wanted to do for his job. She didn't want to marry someone who would be absent, or someone in such a dangerous profession, but would feel better if he stayed and worked as a teacher, because she loved him too.  It was the next day that Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. Shocked, he looked through the box of belongings that Charlie had left him, and after seeing what little Charlie had left behind in terms of meaningful connections, he called The Academy to accept the teaching job. In the end, though, Ben recognized that he would never be happy without trying to explore the stars, so he tells Laura he will not be around when she wakes up because he has to see what's out there, and takes Laura's wedding ring and that of Charlie's wife with him, as mementos.

The students have spent the last six years of their lives dedicating themselves to learning about minerals, metals, colonization, and space travel for the sake of helping the people on Earth. The class of 1995 is the first of its kind, and the family members and friends who attend the graduation understandably have very high hopes for the graduates. The graduation speaker is Robert Chandler, a spaceman who landed a rocket on Mars and created the first colony there. He has also traveled to Venus twice. For most laymen, accomplishing something as adventurous as landing on other planets is unthinkable, and the men graduating are the next in line to make such unthinkable journeys. \n\nBen looks out over the crowds of people and thinks to himself that these strangers are looking at him as if he\u2019s some sort of god.

Mickey reveals for the first time in the story the dangers of the job, the exposure to uncertainty and hazards, and the demands it places on a human body.\nAlthough it is a high pressure, dangerous job, being a spaceman is romanticized through Ben\u2019s childhood dream while he ultimately commits to see through at the end of the story.

However, Ben and Mickey know it can be a dangerous profession: Mickey explains that on the more dangerous missions, where one is one of the first on a planet, you're lucky to live five to ten years. This is important because Laura has this knowledge when she talks to Ben about their possible future together. She knows that he could die, their children could be exposed to dangerous radiation, and he would likely always be looking for the next adventure instead of coming home to her. In general, the spacemen are appreciated for their services to the society but there is some understanding of the limitations on the types of meaningful personal connections they are able to make."

        "Query": "Who is Stardust Charlie and what is his significance in Spacemen Die at Home?",
        "Article": "I liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.\nThey were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,\ndeep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was\ncool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional\nvideo, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or\nhousework.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a\nshower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\n  \n \n  At the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \"Only hit\nMars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.\nSkipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,\nthe medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid\nin your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.\nHell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\"\n  \n \n  That was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\n  \n \n  Afterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,\nto watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally\nstreaked up from White Sands.\n  \n \n  We gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:\n\"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's\nsort of funny.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those\ndays, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a\nspaceman then.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\"\n  \n \n  I smiled and shook my head. \"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie\ndoesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as\nI know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\"\n  \n \n  You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew\nsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\n  \n \n  There was silence.\n  \n \n  You were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were\nflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the\nfeeling that I shouldn't have come here.\n  \n \n  You kept looking at me until I had to ask: \"What are you thinking,\nLaura?\"\n  \n \n  You laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \"No, I shouldn't be\nthinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I could never hate you.\"\n  \n \n  \"It\u2014it's about the stars,\" you said very softly. \"I understand why you\nwant to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were\nkids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I\ndreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I\nlived for months, just thinking about it.\n  \n \n  \"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,\nand the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I\nrealized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting\nbefore you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\"\n  \n \n  I frowned. \"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think\nmaybe I haven't grown up yet?\"\n  \n \n  Anxiety darkened your features. \"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,\nto see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it\nworth the things you'd have to give up?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \"Give up\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Then I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\n  \n \n  All through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\n  \n \n  Government boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on\nthe stars.\n  \n \n  Now I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that\nI'd never noticed before.\n  \n \n \n   You can go into space\n   \n  , I thought,\n   \n   and try to do as much living in\nten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died\nin a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie\nburied in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like\nCharlie\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally\nalone, never finding a home.\n   \n \n \n \n   Or there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth\nin cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with\na wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow\nold, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who\nfill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous\ndust.\n   \n \n \n  \"I'm sorry,\" you said. \"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" I said, clenching my fists. \"You made sense\u2014a lot of\nsense.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>And now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\n  \n \n  I have two wedding rings with me\u2014his wife's ring and yours.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>At last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,\nbabbling wave.\n  \n \n  Then I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\n  \n \n  His wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining\nlike a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear\nrows.\n  \n \n  But he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and\nold, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that\nit was hard to believe he'd once been young.\n  \n \n  He scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\n  \n \n  \"You made it, boy,\" he chortled, \"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate\ntonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as\ngood spacemen should!\"\n  \n \n  Then Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,\nwalking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm\nwith some silent melody.\n  \n \n  And you, Laura, were with him.\n  \n \n  \"Meet the Brat,\" he said. \"My sister Laura.\"\n  \n \n  I stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity\nof your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a\ngolden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes\nof a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a\ngentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\n  \n \n  \"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\" you said. \"I've heard of no one else for\nthe past year.\"\n  \n \n  A tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an\nintroduction of Charlie.\n  \n \n  You and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old\nStardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie\nscorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a\nshiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.\nHis tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\n  \n \n  And the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the\nresult of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so\naccustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I\nknew, would find them ugly.\n  \n \n  You were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \"It's a privilege to\nmeet you, Charlie. Just think\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first\nto reach the Moon!\"\n  \n \n  Charlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \"Still going to spend the\nweekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're\nplanning to see the town tonight.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you both come with us?\" you asked. \"Our folks have their\nown plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.\nCharlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the\nMoon?\"\n  \n \n  Charlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew\nthat he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian\nfizzes and Plutonian zombies.\n  \n \n  But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\n  \n \n  \"We'd really like to come,\" I said.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Charlie Taggart, also known as Stardust Charlie, is a very important character in the story. Ben is orphaned at the age of four when his parents perished in a strato-jet crash. Within a few years, he meets Charlie, a successful spaceman, at the Long Island Spaceport. He follows him around, eager to learn everything he can about space, and Charlie eventually becomes the closest thing Ben has to a family member. \n\nAlthough Ben doesn\u2019t know if Charlie will show up at his graduation, he is happy to see he has taken 24 hours off of work to come and celebrate with him. He worries, however, that Charlie looks very ill. He becomes even more concerned when Charlie leaves a small tin for Ben to look through after he leaves. Charlie admits that he has cheated death many times, and he knows he won\u2019t be able to escape it forever. Ben remains hopeful that they will see each other again when Charlie tells him to meet him at the Space Rat, a cafe on Mars. \n\nAfter Ben receives word that Charlie died from lung-rot, he takes it as a sign that he should stay on earth and live an ordinary life with Laura as his wife. The trinkets in Charlie\u2019s tin do not impress Ben or symbolize a life well-lived. Yet, hours later, Ben finds Charlie\u2019s wedding ring and changes his mind about his entire life\u2019s path. He knows that Charlie wanted to talk to him alone before he died, and he never gave him the chance to tell him about the same difficult decisions he had to make. Ben realizes that Charlie\u2019s life may not be one that\u2019s suitable for everyone, but it was certainly a life worth living. Charlie returned to space knowing that he was about to die because the planets and moons and stars were his reason for living. To Charlie, the sacrifices he made to be a spaceman were worth it, and Ben sees that he wants that for himself as well. \n",

Space was his home, not Earth. Charlie\u2019s death causes a slight crisis for Ben when he has to decide if he should stay on Earth or take to the skies. At first, he decides to stay so he can marry Laura and live a long and happy life with her. He didn\u2019t want to die alone like Charlie. However, after discovering a wedding ring hidden in Charlie\u2019s possessions, he realizes that despite Charlie\u2019s solitary lifestyle he was never truly alone. Space was his true home, and Ben decides that space truly can\u2019t be that lonely if men like Charlie are out there flying around. He decides to leave Laura and all his domestic dreams behind on Earth and follow his mentor to Mars, so he can meet in the place where he took his last breath: the Space Rat on Mars.

Charlie is also actively helping him to achieve that dream, as Ben remembers Charlie\u2019s recommendation finally getting him in as a cadet to become a spaceman.\nCharlie acts as a guide in the story, made possible because Ben trusts him so deeply. Ben treats Charlie as family, even inviting him to his graduating ceremony as part of the first class of the US Academy of Interplanetary Flight.

Because Ben did not have family left alive, Charlie was the one person who Ben invited to his graduation; he had met him as a child, they got to know one another, and it was Charlie's recommendation that got Ben into the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight. He had aged much in the year before Ben's graduation, but did show up to the ceremony, ready to celebrate with Ben. After a day of celebration, Charlie left a box of belongings with Ben as he went back to work. It was then that Ben started to worry about Charlie's health. After spending forty days with Mickey's family trying to decide what he wants, Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. When Ben looked through Charlie's possessions, he realized that there was a lack of evidence of real human connection, and this pushed Ben to call The Academy and accept the teaching job so that he could be with Laura and not run away to the stars. At the same time, Ben reflected on the stories he had been told and the life Charlie had lived. Charlie had been married, but learned the hard way that he could not have both a family and the stars. Eventually, Ben decided to go into space instead of staying with Laura, but the only context he had for the decision was Charlie's stories. \n"

Their childhood bedrooms and their upbringing was something that he all of a sudden felt he was lacking due to his experience growing up in dormitories with rules and regulations. He cites that his singular focus on his dream to be a spaceman didn\u2019t allow him to stop and notice the things that he felt he missed in his childhood.\nThis childhood of separation from family, and attaching himself to a pioneering lone-wolf spaceman (Charlie) after pestering him while he was a child in a spaceport, led Ben to romanticize and want a life of opportunity to be the first to see new planets.

His parents died in a rocket crash when he was young, which caused two immediate effects: Ben's lack of parental figures in his life, which spurred his interest in Charlie and causes his childhood to be irregular in other ways, and Ben's general interest in rockets. In this way, rockets have affected him at various stages in life: he would have lived a very different life if they didn't exist, because his parents would not have died, but he would not have had them to attach his big dreams to either, which means that maybe he would have been perfectly happy staying on Earth with Laura in another version of events. He had to clutch onto his dreams as he was growing up because everything he saw was structure. As he put it, it was a \"cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and routines and rules\". His dreams of going to the stars, then, were his way of escaping this structure. He would never have applied to the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight otherwise. "

You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and\npromise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\n  \n \n  One morning I thought,\n   \n   Why must I make a choice?

I could try it for a couple of years,\nthen teach.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't\nyou want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\"\n  \n \n  Your voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears\nglittering in your eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened\non the\n   \n   Cyclops\n   \n  . There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was\nflooded with radiation\u2014just for a second. It didn't seem serious.

        "Summary_1": "When Ben meets Laura, Mickey\u2019s sister, at his spaceman graduation, he feels an instant connection with her. He enjoys talking to her and wants to learn everything there is to know about her. Although he\u2019s happy to see Charlie Taggart, the closest thing he has to a family member, he chooses spending time with Laura and her family over spending time with Charlie alone. He can\u2019t help feeling drawn to her. \n\nAt first, Ben is completely oblivious to the feelings that Laura has for him, but after a walk under the stars together, he sees that she also sees a future with him. He has never before considered living on earth, getting married, owning a house, and settling for a \u201cboring\u201d life, but after she suggests that visiting the stars might just be like her trip to England, he wonders if she\u2019s right. Maybe he has hyped up space travel so much and it will end up being a disappointment. Maybe Mickey is onto something, and sacrificing a normal life on earth where living to old age is expected is not a choice he should give up so easily. Ben desperately wants to be with Laura. He loves her just as much as he loves the stars. \n\nHe spends forty incredible days with the woman of his dreams, but in the end, it\u2019s not enough to convince him to give up his lifelong dream of being a spaceman. Sure, he\u2019s uncomfortable with the amount of pressure that\u2019s put on him, and he recognizes that he will be risking his life every single day, but he can see that Charlie does not regret giving up the quiet homelife for the incredible adventures that await in space. Ben wants to be the first man to visit a planet or find a helpful mineral or create a useful colony, and his love for Laura cannot change his dreams.\n",
        "Summary_2": "At first, Ben is infatuated with Laura and the dark flecks in her eyes. They grow closer and closer together as Ben\u2019s stay in their house continues on. Between stargazing, conversing, swimming, and dancing, Ben and Laura quickly fell in love. When he asks her to marry him, however, things start to change. She says that she will marry Ben the teacher, but not Ben the spaceman. She does not want to be resigned to a life of solitude, fear, and separation. Ben is forced to make a choice then: Laura or his dreams of being an explorer. Although at first he decides to stay with Laura and become a teacher, he quickly changes his mind. In some ways, he has already married space and is as devoted to it as he was to Laura. He says in the end that he will always carry Laura and Charlie with him wherever he goes, though they may not be there with him physically. Although there was the potential for marriage, it seems that it was not meant to be. ",
        "Summary_3": "Ben and Laura\u2019s relationship moves quickly from the time they meet at Ben\u2019s graduation until he decides to become a spaceman (about forty days later).\nBen meets Laura at his graduation ceremony as part of the first class of the US Academy of Interplanetary Flight. Laura is the sister of his fellow spaceman, Mickey, whom he has become close with during training. Laura learns about Ben before she meets him from the stories told to her by her brother Mickey. When they have Ben and Charlie to their parents house for the weekend, Ben and Laura spend an evening after dinner watching for crimson-tailed continental rockets taking off from White Sands port. It was then that Ben knew Laura liked him.\nMickey invites Ben to stay with them until he decides what to take as his next opportunity - a berth on the Odyssey spaceship with the potential to go to Pluto or a safe job teaching astrogation at the academy. He stays forty days and forty nights. During this time, he falls in love with Laura and proposes to her.\nTheir relationship changes when Laura questions what a life would be like married to Ben as a spaceman. She has fears about bearing children with a spaceman since there was an example of one family having a \u201cmonster\u201d child after the father was exposed to radiation in space. She is worried about not seeing her husband for months or years at a time. Ben is torn between the woman he loves and the life he has been dreaming of since childhood to become a spaceman.\nUltimately Ben decides to be a spaceman and leaves Laura the wedding ring in Charlie\u2019s tin box (that was from Charlie\u2019s broken marriage after choosing life in space) as a token of his affection, and of the bittersweetness of having to leave behind a potentially happy life for his love of space. Perhaps Ben one day hopes to return and have Laura still waiting to marry him.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Laura is the sister of Ben's friend Mickey, whom he met at their graduation from The Academy. She invited Ben and Charlie to celebrate with her and Mickey after the ceremony, and gives away the fact that Mickey is no longer planning on signing up to be on a rocket with Ben, and wants a safer job. Ben realizes later that night that he and Laura have feelings for each other, so this is motivation for him to stay with Mickey's family while he sorts out what he wants to do. The two spend forty days together before Ben proposes to Laura, who has been trying to figure out what Ben wants for the entirety of their relationship. This is the entirety of their relationship as of the time of the story, starting with their realization of an attraction and an interest in each other and ending in a proposal (that was presumably accepted) and then a breaking-off of the relationship. They both want to be with one another, and Ben wants to get married no matter what, but Laura knows that he cannot live as a spaceman and as a caring and attentive husband to her, so he must choose. In this sense, Laura's outlook is very steady for their entire relationship, as she asked Ben on the first night they met if he really wanted to become a spaceman if it meant giving up everything he could have. A lot changes in the last day or so of Ben's stay with the family, as he receives news that Charlie passed away. It looking through Charlie's belongings that he recognizes that he can't have the space life and the meaningful personal connections he might want (at least of the sort he had with Laura at the time), which makes him come to a snap realization that he should accept the teaching job and stay on Earth. However, his eventually falls to his gut which tells him he would never be happy if he never tried to see the stars, and that his relationship with Laura has to end. Without Charlie's stories and belongings, Ben may not have realized that he would not be able to have the best of both worlds at the same time.\n"

        "Summary_1": "Sometime after the year 2903, the narrator of the story, Mr. Corrigan, is having a recruiting day on the planet of Ghryne, which he privately calls MacTavish IV. Mr. Corrigan owns a popular zoo on Earth called the Corrigan Institute - the only place where humans can see other species of the universe. He recruits alien life forms to exhibit at the zoo, and relatively quickly signs eleven new specimens onto his current 690 that are under contract at the institute on earth. This is a viable business because the World Congress declared Earth off-bounds to aliens in 2903, and the only way aliens can now go to Earth is as exhibits in this zoo.\n\nAliens make great sacrifices to come interview with Mr. Corrigan, as it seems he offers them a good deal. Those under contract are required to remain on exhibit for less than one-third of each day and get paid $50 Galactic a week, with expenses and transportation included. \n\nHe interviews many different creatures through the day, with some being noteworthy and some not as much, being ushered away quickly by Mr. Corrigan\u2019s assistant Stebbins. \n\nA Stortulian who claims his wife ran away to the Corrigan Institute, leaving him alone and unable to remarry due to his customs, pleads with Corrigan to let him go to Earth or at the very least to send her back. Mr. Corrigan is slightly frazzled by the story, but ultimately asks the Stortulian to leave, feeling sad and that he may commit suicide upon leaving and losing hope for his wife to return.\nVallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV, was another notable interview. He stormed in and demanded to be signed to contract - and Mr. Corrigan preferred to make his own decisions. Herald felt insulted that the only four Kallerians at the institute were from the Clan Verdrokh, with no representation at all from his Clan Gursdrinn. Corrigan insisted he was unable to take another Kallerian, and apologized for insulting Clan Gursdrinn. This was enough to de-escalate physical violence, but Heraal was not pleased, and had to be escorted out of the room by Auchinleck and Ludlow who were summoned when Corrigan pushed a panic button under his desk.\nIn a surprise twist from what Corrigan had expected - the Stortulian to kill himself, and for Heraal to try to kill him - the opposite happens. Heraal storms in and stabs himself with his own sword, killing him instantly. The Stortulian returns and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, who is narrowly saved by being tackled by Gorb. The Ghrynian cops attempt to place a $100,000 fine on Corrigan for causing the death of a being (Heraal, who killed himself after being refused a contract). Gorb offers to get Corrigan out of the situation for $5000 and a contract to the institute, which is accepted.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Corrigan, of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, is visiting MacTavish IV (Ghryne) in the Caledonia Cluster for a few days to hold interviews for new specimens to be featured in his zoo. All life forms, aside from Terra, were banned from ever visiting Earth since 2903, so the only way to get in is to be viewed for science, hence the zoo. The Institute has 690 specimens currently, encompassing 298 life-forms. He brings his men with him, Auchinleck, Stebbins, and Ludlow, to help calm the masses. His first applicant of the day walks in: a round creature with five eyed-arms and two legs. He introduces himself as Lawrence R. Fitzgerald of Regulus II, showing himself to be a Terraphile. Corrigan signs him on for half the normal pay and sends him on his way. A urisinoid from Aldebaran IX is next, but Corrigan has no need for another one. He signs a creature from Donovan\u2019s Planet, since they are such crowd-pleasers, and nine more. He also turns down at least 87 other life-forms, only of which, a Vegan, he feels remorse about. \nHis last specimen before lunch seems to be an Earthman pulling a con. He calls himself Ildwar Gorb and claims he\u2019s from Wazzenaxx XIII. Corrigan doesn\u2019t believe his tale and sends him out, though Gorb promises he\u2019ll change his mind before long. \nAfter lunch, trouble starts to arise. A Kallerian comes in and demands a place in his zoo, even though they already have four. Vallo Heraal of Clan Gursdrinn feels Corrigan has insulted his clan by only hiring members of Clan Verdrokh. Corrigan tries to calm him, but nothing can assuage his anger. He presses his trouble button, and his men come in and take Heraal away. \nA small alien runs into the room, sneaking past Stebbins, and begs to be brought to Earth so he can reunite with his soulmate, a previously hired Stortulian. She ran away from him when she got the opportunity to live on Earth, and, per Stortulian customs, the Stortulian was not allowed to remarry. \nCorrigan turns him down and continues on with his day until Gorb arrives again. He snuck past his men and offers himself as staff. Corrigan says no, but just then the Kallerian comes crashing in and commits hara-kiri, killing himself in front of the crowd. The police enter and claim Corrigan was the cause of his death since he had just filed a complaint against him. He can either be arrested or fined $100K. Next, the Stortulian walks back in and claims there is no reason to keep living. Unlike the Kallerian, he attempts to murder Corrigan by shooting his gun. However, Corrigan is shoved out of the way by Gorb. The Stortulian is arrested, and his actions are explained by Gorb. \nCorrigan decides to call his lawyer, but Gorb offers him a deal he can\u2019t refuse.

Corrigan is the proprietor of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, a glorified Terran zoo that offers spectators a glimpse at several hundred species of non-terrestrial life forms from all over the galaxy. Corrigan prides himself on actually employing his exhibits rather than hunting them down. Because Earth had closed its borders in the 29th century to non-terrestrial visitors, getting a job at Corrigan's zoo is a popular way for non-terrestrials to visit the planet and make a decent living at the same time. Corrigan offers good pay, short hours, and cover transportation costs and other expenses. Although he is generous, he is also thrifty and not above conning the public in the name of advancing his business. Corrigan arrives at the planet Ghryne to interview potential new non-terrestrials for his exhibition assisted by his employees Stebbins, Auchinleck, and Ludlow. He interviews dozens of non-terrestrials from planets all over the galaxy, including Mr. Lawrence R. Fitzgerald, a self-described Terraphile from Regulus II who wants to go to Earth so badly he is willing to work for less pay. Next, Corrigan meets Ildwar Gorb, a non-terrestrial from Wazzenazz XIII who looks remarkably like a human and claims to communicate through telepathic projection. Because of this similarity, Corrigan suspects him of actually being an Earthman attempting to con him for a free ride back to Earth. He dismisses Gorb, who implores him to reconsider and promises to return. After Gorb leaves, a Kallerian named Vallo Heraal enters and demands Corrigan hire him immediately or he will cause trouble. Wary of the Kallerian's size and threats, Corrigan fingers the meshgun trigger hidden under his desk in case he needs to protect himself. After Auchinleck and Ludlow escort Heraal out of the room, a small Stortulian enters Corrigan's office and tells him he doesn't want to work for him necessarily, but he is seeking passage to Earth so he can be reunited with his wife, who is currently under Corrigan's employ at the Institute.  When Corrigan refuses, the Stortulian leaves, and Corrigan process several dozen more applicants. When Gorb reenters and offers to replace Stebbins due to his incompetent handling of the non-terrestrials waiting in line, Corrigan threatens to have him thrown out. At that moment, Heraal returns, brandishing a large sword, which he uses to kill himself in front of everyone. As Corrigan processes this turn of events, the Ghrynian police enter and charge Corrigan with Heraal's death which includes a $100,000 Galactic fine. Next, the Stortulian reenters and attempts to shoot Corrigan, who is saved by Gorb. Gorb offers to solve Corrigan's legal liability for the death of Heraal in exchange for $5,000 Galactic and a contract with the Corrigan Institute.

Corrigan of Earth\u2019s Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is on the planet MacTavish IV (aka Ghryne by its natives) to recruit alien life forms as specimens for display in what is effectively a zoo. This is the only way aliens can visit Earth because in 2903 the World Congress declared Earth off-limits for non-terrestrials. Throughout the day, Corrigan interviews many colorful, interesting alien life forms, ultimately hiring about two dozen. His goal is to have a collection of at least one member of 500 different races and currently has 298. He rejects some applicants simply because he already has specimens of their type. One applicant, Gorb, looks and sounds like a human but claims to be from a plant named Wazzenazz XIII. Corrigan is convinced he is just a human and sends him on his way, but Gorb says he will be back to give Corrigan another chance. \nLater in the day, Corrigan has two troublesome interviews, the first with a distraught Kallerian named Vallo Heraal who wants to be hired because four other Kallerians have been hired from a different clan than his, and he feels his clan has been insulted. Corrigan apologizes for having unintentionally insulted Heraal\u2019s clan but explains that he doesn\u2019t need any more Kallerians now; he offers to give preference to Heraal\u2019s clan when there is a vacancy. Unappeased, Heraal warns Corrigan that he will be sorry, and Corrigan sends for members of his team to escort him out. Next, a squirrely-looking Stortulian slips in, exclaiming that he must speak with Corrigan. The Stortulian explains that he is there because his wife is on Earth in Corrigan\u2019s display. She left him because she wanted to go to Earth, and now he is lonely but forbidden by his customs to remarry. He doesn\u2019t want to be hired but just wants passage to Earth to persuade his wife to return home. Corrigan patiently tells the Stortulian he can\u2019t take him because it would be illegal. The Stortullian accepts defeat, saying he has no hope at all, and Corrigan has the distinct impression that the fellow is going to commit suicide. \nAt the end of the day, Gorb returns, asking Corrigan to hire him to work with his company. Heraal crashes in and tells Corrigan he has contacted the authorities and accused him of causing the death of a life-form before he kills himself. The police arrive to arrest Corrigan, but the Stortulian returns, again claiming his life isn\u2019t worth living and fires a shot at Corrigan who is saved by the swift action of Gorb who pushes him out of the way.\n"

If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was\ngoing to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I\nremembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to\ncome bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000\nper suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.\n  \n \n  I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced\narrival.\n  \n \n  The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway\nand stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian\npolicemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a\nmoment and turned to eye the newcomer.\n  \n \n  I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I\nresolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again\u2014or, if I\n   \n   did\n   \n  come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against\ncrackpots.\n  \n \n  In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, \"Life is no longer\nworth living.

My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I\nguess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on.\n  \n \n  Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole\nin the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I\nsaw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The\nman who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting\nhimself off.\n  \n \n  He helped me up. \"Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that\nStortulian wasn't here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying\nfragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed\nplaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the\nstruggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.\n  \n \n  \"Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian\npsychology, Corrigan,\" Gorb said lightly. \"Suicide is completely\nabhorrent to them. When they're troubled, they kill the person who\ncaused their trouble. In this case, you.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Ildwar Gorb is a human-looking alien of the planet Wazzenazz XIII in the Crab Nebula. He claims to have never been within \u201ca dozen parsecs of Earth,\u201d but to look so human-like due to an evolutionary fluke. As he is interviewing with Mr. Corrigan, he says he is not actually speaking, but is a telepathic that communicates in symbols that are translated into the colloquial speech of the person he is interacting with.\nHe appeals to Mr. Corrigan to be exhibited as a specimen, but when Corrigan in unconvinced Gorb isn\u2019t just a regular human trying to fool him, he also tries to appeal to him to hire him as a member of his human staff. This is also a no, since Mr. Corrigan would be breaking the law to do so if he was an alien.\nGorb throws himself at Mr. Corrigan to tackle him and save his life from a murder attempt by the Stortulian. This gesture buys him enough goodwill for Corrigan to accept his offer to get him out of the trouble with the Ghrynian cops. He will do the job for $5000 and a contract to the Corrigan Institute - ultimately getting him what he wanted in the first place.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Gorb is a tall, thin humanoid or man with blue eyes and sandy hair. Despite being well-dressed and clean, Mr. Corrigan still claims he was shabby-looking. He introduces himself as Ildwar Gorb and claims he\u2019s from the planet Wazzenazz XIII. Mr. Corrigan immediately believes he is simply an Earthman who ran out of money and is trying to find passage home. However, Gorb continues on, claiming Wazzenazz XIII is home to a race of people similar to that of Earth, and that he doesn\u2019t speak English, he\u2019s in fact telepathic. He asks to be a specimen in Corrigan\u2019s zoo, but he refuses and sends him away. \nLater in the story, Gorb arrives again, having sneaked back his guard, and asks to join his staff if he can\u2019t be a specimen. Corrigan admits Stebbins is lack-luster, but still turns him down. After the Kallerian kills himself and Mr. Corrigan is charged guilty, Gorb bides his time and waits for his moment to step in. When the Stortulian arrives and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, Gorb saves his life by pushing him out of the way of the blast. Gorb explains the difference between Kallerian and Stortulian cultures to a wide-eyed Mr. Corrigan and once again offers his services. He claims he can get Mr. Corrigan out of the legal mess for only a $5,000 fee and a contract to be a specimen in his zoo. Mr. Corrigan hesitantly agrees. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Ildwar Gorb is a non-terrestrial from the planet Wazzenazz XIII, a small planet in the Crab Nebula. He is tall and thin with pale blue eyes, dirty-blond hair, and he strongly resembles an Earthman; he even speaks in Terran accents and has human-like teeth. When he first meets Corrigan, he is clean and well-dressed, but Corrigan notes he looks a bit shabby. Although he has never been anywhere close to Earth, he tells Corrigan his race is identical to the human race and speaks through telepathic projection, and he is looking for a job with Corrigan's zoo, which he calls a \"circus.\" Corrigan is attracted to his glib personality, but he denies him a job because he believes he is an Earthman attempting to con him for a free trip back to Earth. When Gorb leaves, he implores Corrigan to reconsider and tells him he will be back. After several dozen interviews pass, Gorb returns and asks if Corrigan will give him Stebbins' job considering his incompetence in handling bothersome aliens throughout the day. When Corrigan again refuses, Gorb stays in his office as Heraal kills himself in front of them, the Ghrynian policemen enter and charge Corrigan with his death, and the Stortulian comes back and tries to shoot Corrigan. However, Gorb tackles Corrigan to the floor to prevent him from being shot. He predicted the Stortulian's action as he is familiar with their species, and he offers to help Corrigan out of his liability for the death of Heraal in exchange for $5,000 Galactic and a contract with the Institute. ",
        "Summary_4": "Gorb is a human who wants to return to Earth but seemingly can\u2019t afford to do so. He knows how to take advantage of situations, so he tries three approaches to get Corrigan to hire him and take him to Earth. First, he poses as an alien species from a planet called Wazzenazz XIII in the Crab Nebula. Gord is tall and slender with blue eyes and dirty blond hair. He is neat and clean, but his appearance is somewhat shabby, suggesting he might be down on his luck. He claims his name is Ildwar Gorb and that he represents the only humanlike race in the galaxy beyond Earth. He tries to con Corrigan, explaining his humanlike appearance as an evolutionary fluke and his English as telepathic symbols that Corrigan translates into English. Corrigan sees through the ruse, though, and refuses to hire Gorb. Gorb leaves Corrigan\u2019s office saying he\u2019ll give Corrigan another chance.\n\tThat afternoon, Gorb returns to Corrigan\u2019s office, this time setting aside his alien story and presenting himself as a human applying for a place on Corrigan\u2019s staff. He points out that he is familiar with alien life-forms, having lived in the outworlds for half of his life. Gorb says that he would have been able to stop the aliens who unexpectedly entered Corrigan\u2019s office and suggests Corrigan fire Stebbins and hire him in his place. \n\tGorb is present when Heraal returns and commits suicide in Corrigan\u2019s office, and when the police arrive telling Corrigan that they are arresting him for contributing to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form, he hears the police pronounce Corrigan\u2019s penalty of either two years in prison or a fine of $100,000 Galactic. When the Stortulian arrives and tries to shoot Corrigan, Gorb anticipates his action and tackles Corrigan, knocking him to the floor, so that the Stortulian\u2019s shot misses. Afterward, Gorb demonstrates his knowledge of alien life when he explains that Stortulians despise suicide, and when a Stortulian believes someone has caused him trouble, he kills the person who caused the trouble. Gorb also tells Corrigan that he can help him get out of his situation for only $5,000 Galactic and a specimen contract. Corrigan decides that Gorb might be able to help him better than the Terran Consulate, so he accepts Gorb\u2019s offer contingent on Gorb\u2019s success of getting him out of his arrest and fine.\n"

He prides himself on not hunting non-terrestrial and instead prefers to attract them by offering good pay, short hours, expenses, and transportation costs; in addition, he calls himself a \"man of principles\" and advertises about the thrill of show business and romance of life on Earth. Because Corrigan is willing to con the public--he calls himself \"a straightforward double-dealer\"--he believes he understands a con when he sees one, which is why he initially rejects Gorb's interview for a job. Corrigan is used to dealing with species from all over the galaxy, and he is prepared for trouble, so he has a meshgun trigger concealed below his desk and never allows himself to be bullied. In case he needs back up, he also employs Stebbins, who manages the line of non-terrestrials for Corrigan to interview, as well as Auchinleck and Ludlow. One of Corrigan's driving principles in dealing with non-terrestrials is to never make a business decision based upon sentiment as demonstrated by his dealings with the Stortulian. However, this interaction shows that he does feel empathy for those affected by his decisions.",
        "Summary_4": "J.F. Corrigan is a businessman and owner of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science. An astute businessman who also manipulates and uses others, he has built a lucrative \u201cinstitute\u201d that is really just a zoo that exhibits odd-looking aliens. Before his current position, Corrigan was a lowly carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. After the World Congress ruled Terra off-limits for aliens in 2903, Corrigan concocted his business plan. His goal is to display representatives of 500 extraterrestrial species. Corrigan can \u201cread\u201d his interviewees and take advantage of them for his own benefit. For example, when he realizes how eager Mr. Fitzgerald is to see Earth, he hires him for half of what he usually pays, knowing that Fitzgerald\u2019s eagerness will prevent him from realizing the offer takes advantage of him. \n\tThroughout the day of interviews, Corrigan assesses the applicants in terms of their value to him. While he doesn\u2019t mind taking advantage of them, he doesn\u2019t go so far as to cheat them. He is a bit of a con-man himself, hiring Mr. Fitz for half his going rate and placating Heraal with a less-than-heartfelt apology and promise to give members of his clan preference the next time they need to hire a Kallerian. Yet he won\u2019t do anything that blatantly breaks the law such as transporting a Stortulian to Earth when the alien isn\u2019t one of his hirees. He has a limited conscience; when he fears that the Stortulian will commit suicide, he feels bad about it, but he also doesn\u2019t do anything to prevent it. His pragmatism and business acumen override his emotions, preventing him from caving to the creature\u2019s requests, even if it means the creature will commit suicide. Corrigan is also sharp enough to spot a con; he recognizes Gorb for what he is: an Earthman using any means possible to obtain a paid trip to Earth. When Gorb comes across as glib and appealing despite his preposterous story, Corrigan recognizes the man\u2019s similarity to himself. Corrigan acknowledges that he is a double-dealer yets describes himself as a man of principles. Because he is a con man, he is cynical of others. Corrigan is also a manipulator who says what others want to hear (such as calling the planet Ghryne by its native name) because he knows this is a way to win their trust.\n\tCorrigan likes to think of himself as a man who has principles, but some of those principles are the ones that ensure good business decisions rather than the values regarding what is right or wrong. He also thinks of himself as a man with a conscience who doesn\u2019t exploit beings, but that is exactly what he does. He believes that because he pays his employees and they are volunteering to be placed on exhibit, he isn\u2019t exploiting them.\n\n"

His office has a desk, chairs for his interviewees to sit in, and a sign advertising that extraterrestrials are wanted. There is a waiting room outside the office, and applicants are buzzed in by Corrigan\u2019s assistant.\n\nOn this planet, there is a strong desire for aliens to want to go on exhibit on Earth. Mr. Corrigan profits from having them on display, and is willing to go through long and stressful interview days to hand select his specimens. His desire is to have at least 500 different alien races in his collection.\n\nThere is frequent reference to the location of the Corrigan Institute on Earth, though it is never visited in the story.

This planet is in the Caledonia cluster and currently the home of Mr. Corrigan\u2019s interviews. The Caledonia cluster is one of the many crossroads of interstellar travel, so it features many specimens from a variety of planets. The story mostly takes place in Mr. Corrigan\u2019s office, featuring a desk and a few chairs for his specimens to sit in. He hides weapons beneath his desk in case of a scary situation, as well as a distress button. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in the 30th century primarily on Ghryne, whose official Terran name is MacTavish IV, a planet in the Caledonia Cluster, which includes other planets such as Aldebaran IX, Regulus II, Donovan's Planet, Stortul XII, and more. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet, and Mr. Corrigan holds his interviews here for his Corrigan Institute from Thirdday to Fifthday of Tenthmonth. Having been declared off-limits for non-terrestrial beings by the World Congress in 2903, Earth is now an exclusive place to be, which heightens the appeal and romance of working and visiting there. The Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is a Terran zoo that exhibits non-terrestrial beings from all over the universe. With 690 specimens representing 298 different intelligent life-forms, the ultimate goal of the zoo is to present at least one member of at least 500 different races. Corrigan has a desk equipped with a meshgun trigger that keeps him safe in the event a non-terrestrial becomes hostile towards him.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place sometime in the early 30th century as Corrigan\u2019s ad announces this recruiting trip is his last in the Caledonia Cluster until 2937. Days and months are named by their sequence in the week or year, hence, Thirdday, Fifthday, and Tenmonth. In 2903, the World Congress ruled that aliens were forbidden on Earth unless they were there as a specimen of a scientific collection. This exception is what allows Corrigan to conduct his lucrative business. Most of the story is set In the rented Corrigan office on the planet MacTavis (IV), or Ghryne according to its residents. All of the action takes place on this planet, although there are a few references to Earth. MacTavis (IV) is an ideal planet for Corrgan\u2019s interviews since this planet is at the interstellar crossroads, making it easily accessible for aliens from across the Caledonia Cluster to respond to Corrigan\u2019s ad for alien species to be transported to Earth for display. The planet has the features of a civilization, including city districts organized into blocks, office buildings, and hotels. There is a police department that quickly responds to emergencies and has set penalties for infractions against the law. Ghryne uses the Galactic monetary system. Corrigan\u2019s office has a modern executive set-up where he works in an inner office while his assistants manage his appointments. He has a button he can push to alert his team that they need to escort someone away from his office.

        "Summary_3": "Spaceman Ben Curtis walks into the Blast Inn, a dive bar in the Venusian Hoover City. He is approached by a young Martian boy, who brings him to a table where a Martian orchestra plays aside them. In the bar, Ben is anxious and paranoid, particularly upon noticing a few Hoover City police officers. While he sits, Ben is unable to shake the image of a dead man next to him, who is a man named Cobb. Prior to Ben's arrival to Venus, he had stepped into a bar in Luna City, where an intoxicated Cobb was rambling about spacemen and how he despises them. Out of rage and personal offense, Ben punched Cobb in the chin, who died on impact after falling. Ben immediately fled to Venus in search of a red-bearded giant, the leader of a renegade space crew, who was his only hope in survival and job security after the murder. Still seated at the table, the Martian boy continues prodding Ben, who gives him a coin to shoo him off. He soon notices the space policemen from before closing in on him, raising weapons, and he attempts to escape the bar but is shot. Becoming unconscious, Ben hears the voice of a woman, who leads him out of the exit and helps him escape. He then awakes, unable to see clearly, but being cared for and fed. After nine days, he is able to see the woman clearly, who introduces herself as Maggie, and she tells him that they are no longer in Hoover City. She then discloses all the information she has on Ben, including his desire to find the red-bearded man. Ben asks her if Cobb had a wife and kids, which she confirms. As Ben scans the room, he notices a photo of the red-bearded man, and he slips into sleep, where he is again haunted by visions of Cobb. Ben asks Maggie how she knows the man, and she reveals that he is her husband, and that they saved Ben because they were in need of an astrogator. Maggie tells him about the renegade crew, and how they plan on relocating to an asteroid to avoid the authorities. Ben is overwhelmed and fearful of the prospect, but Maggie encourages him to get rest, and he reflects on his future and his duty.",

When he gets to the Venusian gin mill, a Martian kid tries to sell him various things to pique his interest. Ben indicates that he is not interested in any of the offers and the kid eventually leads him to a table that is partially hidden. The location of his table is intentional because he does not want to be seen. Ben becomes deep in thought at the table, intent on finding a man described as having a red beard. \n\nWhile at the table, he also thinks about the events that transpired over the last week when he arrived in Luna City from White Sands. Ben had gone to a bar to celebrate his arrival to Luna City when Cobb drunkenly accosted him. Cobb purposefully tried to anger Ben and eventually was successful in doing so after a particularly poignant threat. In a quick and anger-filled response, Ben struck Cobb causing Cobb to crack his head against the edge of the bar and die. Ben flew to Venus in response to the incident, which explains how he currently arrived in a Venusian bar. \n\nHis thoughts are interrupted when he notices policemen entering the bar. The police quickly find Ben and begin to use deadly neuro-pistols. He begins to run and is eventually hit by one of the blasts from the neuro-pistols. As he realizes he is losing consciousness, an unknown pair of hands guided him towards a different exit. Ben passes out from the blast and wakes up in a room. For 9+ days, he goes in and out of sleep in this room while he recovers from his injuries. Maggie, the woman who helped him escape, is the one helping him recover from his injuries. She knows a lot of information about him and his background. \n\nWhile still recovering, Ben notices that on one side of the bed, there is a picture on a bureau in the far corner of the room that shows a portrait of a red-bearded man. He gets really excited at this new revelation. He asks Maggie about the red-bearded man and she confesses that he is her husband and then explains what he does and why she brought Ben with her. Jacob\u2019s group needs an astrogator and want Ben to join them. While Maggie shows that she would be confused if Ben chose not to join the group, she seems to truly be concerned with his recovery. \n\nWhen Maggie leaves the room, Ben reflects on words found in a book from his childhood that talk about the morals of a Space Officer. He acknowledges how very few are able to get the job in the SpaceCorps. The story ends with implications that Ben will choose his moral values and choose not to join Jacob\u2019s group. \n"

        "Summary_1": "The story begins in the Blast Inn, a dim gin mill with a sense of evil. The huge room is obscure with smoke and full of people from different planets drinking and smoking. Ben's table is in the shadows far away, a lonely Martian orchestra is playing. Then the story goes to one week ago, a bar on Earth and a fight. There was a chase then through the rocket front alleys with a thousand stars above. Ben fled to Venus. In the gin mill's shadow, the light is suddenly on, the orchestra leaves and Ben is surrendered to the police. He runs and wakes up in a place he can't see. He is with a woman who looks after him, the room is small with a small window with infinite whiteness outside. He was moved to a different city on Venus. Soon, there turns out to be a photo of a red-bearded man in the room. Nightmares and memories haunt Ben in this room. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story first takes place at the Blast Inn. There are big rooms, a bar and some tables. There is also music playing in the background. Blast Inn has drab concrete walls and debris-strewn floor. There is a rear exit. Later, on Venus, inside the small room in the dome building, there is an unpainted ceiling. The walls are broken and there is a single, round window. There is also a blanket. Outside the window, there is only a translucent and infinite whiteness. The room has a plain chair. On the corner of the room, there is a tri-dimensional photo of the red-bearded man. ",
        "Summary_3": "The first part of the story takes place in the Blast Inn, a bar located in Hoover City on Venus. The bar is described as dark and smoky, with an ominous and mysterious aura. In the bar, a Martian orchestra plays music, and the room is occupied with Venusians, Earthmen, and Martians. When Ben is wounded by the space officials, he is taken to a room by Maggie, still on Venus but outside of Hoover City. The room is comfortable and small, but colorless. It contains a bureau with a photo of Jacob on it. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Ben Curtis standing in the doorway of the Blast Inn on Venus. He walks towards a Venusian gin mill where a Martian kid seats him at a table in a secluded area. The story details that Ben ended up on Venus after accidentally killing a man on Earth. He begins to run from the bar once policemen began to come after him to arrest him. As he\u2019s making his exit, an unfamiliar person guides him towards a hidden exit. After losing consciousness, from the policeman\u2019s blast hitting him during his escape, he wakes up in a room. The room does not give him any indication of the time of day it is nor the name of the planet. In the room, Maggie really comes to aid his recovery. On a bureau in a far corner of the room is a rock portrait of Jacob, the red-bearded man and Maggie\u2019s husband. "

He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep.

Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator?

His clothes were a\nmess, and he needed a shave.\nIf only Brundage had been\nalive ...\n  \n \n  He leaped out of the chair\nas voices sounded behind the\ndoor. Dawes was kicking it\nopen with his foot, his arms\nladen with two rather large\nfeet, still encased in bedroom\nslippers. Charlie was at the\nother end of the burden,\nwhich appeared to be a middle-aged\nman in pajamas. The\nSheriff followed the trio up\nwith a sad, undertaker expression.\nBehind him came Mrs.\nBrundage, properly weeping.\n  \n \n  \"We'll take him to the funeral\nparlor,\" Dawes said,\nbreathing hard. \"Weighs a\nton, don't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"What killed him?\" Sol\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Heart attack.\"\n  \n \n  The fat man chuckled.\n  \n \n  The tableau was grisly.

They have changed their bases many times depending on threatening circumstances. If they see trouble, they move on to the next place. The previous base was near the Pole on Venus. Venus was the base after the group was exiled from Mars. Venus is now no longer able to be the group\u2019s home because it is becoming more and more civilized. So, the group has decided that the new base is going to be on an asteroid. The operation of Jacob and his group is mining. They mine almost pure uranium and tungsten, materials that are scarce on both Earth and Mars. They then sell the materials. "

He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,\ncrimson-braided uniform of the\n   \n   Odyssey's\n   \n  junior astrogation officer.\nHe was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining\nuniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.\n  \n \n  He'd sought long for that key.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",

The few runs to other domes\nseemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.\n  \n \n  The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He swore\nwhen he found the assignment unchanged by \"Friday.\" Even the reflection\nthat it was payday was small consolation.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Johnny!\" said a voice at his shoulder. \"The word is that they're\nfinally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"They say some home-office relative is coming in on the\n   \n   Javelin\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"What's wrong with that?\" asked Tolliver. \"Outside of the way they keep\nhanding out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can go\nback to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reason\nbut them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economy\norbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!\"\n  \n \n  Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under a\nportable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship's\nairlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bags\ninto the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage at\nthe waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.\n  \n \n  She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly even\nin stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade too\nblonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the cap\napparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavy\nsweater, like a spacer.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" she said, sliding into the seat beside\nTolliver. \"By the way, just call me Betty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" agreed Tolliver thinking,\n   \n   Ohmigod! Trying already to be just\none of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer,\nor does he just know where bodies are buried?\n   \n \n \n  \"They were making dates,\" said the girl. \"Were they ribbing me, or is\nit true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true enough,\" Tolliver assured her. \"We need people out here, and\nit costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loaded\nships by 'automatic' flight\u2014that is, a long, slow, economical orbit\nand automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approaching\nEarth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their time\nmaking the entire trip.\"\n  \n",

Thus, for the next few days, he simply hang around the garage, with nothing to do. Then on Friday, he gets assigned to take the creeper outside. He picks Betty up, where he told her about the dangers of Ganymede such as the volcanic puffballs and the mountain slides, he explains his high pay for driving unarmored tractor by mentioning that if he survives the six month, he will retire. However, Tolliver understand that this is completely a lie. After they go to see Jeffers, Betty states that she will not work with them, and them fires Jeffers. Jeffers order his men to lock Betty and Tolliver up. After Tolliver wakes up, they decided to escape.

One day, he does get an assignment. He is meant to pick up a home office relative coming in from the Javelin. Tolliver picks up a woman named Betty and transports her. Very early on he appears not to like her and decides to scare her and make it seem that there is danger at every corner. They arrive at their destination and Tolliver leads Betty to Jeffers office. Tolliver barges into Jeffers office, with Betty in tow, to purposefully upset Jeffers. Jeffers is angered at Tolliver\u2019s arrival, but excitedly greets Betty. However, his warm greeting is not returned by Betty. Betty quickly accuses him of wrongdoings and wants him to leave his position. At first he is too stunned to speak. He quickly recovers and orders some men to lock both Tolliver and Betty in a room. Tolliver tries to fight against one of the guards meant to imprison him.

Tolliver refuses as he wants to return clean and as fast as possible to Earth. Jeffers can't fire him and Tolliver feels safe. For the next few days Johnny has nothing to do as he is made to drive a tractor and doesn't have any assignments. Then he gets word he will be assigned to drive a tractor with some home-office relative, who has a lot of bags as a cargo, which is a simple waste of fuel. The relative is a young girl named Betty who tries to behave like a spacer, like all those relatives do, though they only spend a couple months in space doing nothing. Betty wants to learn traffic routing and she doesn't see Johnny's drive from the city to the spaceport on Ganymede as a mission. That scorn makes the man mad and he tells that the trips are dangerous and many men had died on those drives. Tolliver makes up those lies to scare the girl and diminish her arrogance and scorn, and to impress her in some way, he also shows his significant payment. Then, Tolliver leads subdued Betty to Jeffers, who treats her with utmost respect and sweetness remembering who her father is. The girl though takes a threatening tone claiming she will be in charge of her father's company one day and that she has learned what's going wrong on Ganymede, so Jeffers is as good as fired. Jeffers then calls three men in to lock Betty and Tolliver up. Jeffers believes Tolliver has told everything to Betty and she learns from Johnny that he was asked to join the smuggling gang.

He sits in the office of his supervisor, Jeffers, who has invited him to take part in a scheme where he steals parts of ships' cargoes in order to make profit. Tolliver is skeptical and uncomfortable with this operation, and he refuses. Though Jeffers cannot fire him, because he is on contract, he takes Tolliver off his assigned orbit. The next day, Tolliver finds that instead of being assigned a ship, he has the mundane job of driving a tractor from domes to the spaceport. The job drags on for the next three days when Tolliver is informed that he has the job of escorting a home-office relative to the city. The relative is a young girl named Betty, whom Tolliver immediately perceives as naive and arrogant. To entertain himself on the drive, Tolliver makes up stories about the dangers of Ganymede and his job as a daredevil tractor driver, showing Betty his paycheck. They arrive into the city, and Tolliver leads Betty to Jeffers' office at her request. Jeffers greets Betty, addressing her as Miss Koslow, indicating that she is the daughter of the boss of Koslow Spaceways, to which Tolliver is surprised and secretly regrets the embellished stories he told her. Betty immediately orders Jeffers to be fired out of suspicions of mismanagement. Jeffers, sure that Betty had found out about his side scheme, locks up Tolliver and Betty in an empty office room. Tolliver manages to escape by using fire to bend the plastic door, and Betty insists on joining him. The two find spare spacesuits and get into disguise while they make their way to a spaceship. Tolliver cuts a slit into the dome over the establishment and they squeeze through, running to the spaceport. As they reach the ship, Tolliver notices a tractor headed their way, and he rushes Betty inside. Tolliver quickly launches the ship into orbit despite Betty's protests. Betty then phones Space Patrol, given access by her father, and informs the officer to arrest Jeffers and that the ship they are on has been sent on a six-month orbit. When Betty signs off, it is revealed to Tolliver that she is not actually Koslow's daughter, but a private investigator impersonating her in order to get information on who was stealing from the company. Tolliver informs Betty that they will be on the ship for a while, not telling her that they would be orbiting Ganymede the entire time."

It seemed to him that a long time had\nbeen spent in carrying him there.\n  \n \n  He heard an indignant yelp, and realized that the girl had been pitched\nin with him. The snapping of a lock was followed by the tramp of\ndeparting footsteps and then by silence.\n  \n \n  After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up.\n  \n \n  He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind his\nleft ear, a sensation befuddled him momentarily.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry about that,\" murmured Betty.\n  \n \n  Tolliver grunted. Sorrow would not reduce the throbbing, nor was he\nin a mood to undertake an explanation of why Jeffers did not like him\nanyway.\n  \n \n  \"I think perhaps you're going to have a shiner,\" remarked the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks for letting me know in time,\" said Tolliver.\n  \n \n  The skin under his right eye did feel a trifle tight, but he could see\nwell enough. The abandoned and empty look of the office worried him.\n  \n \n  \"What can we use to get out of here?\" he mused.\n  \n \n  \"Why should we try?\" asked the girl. \"What can he do?\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd be surprised. How did you catch on to him so soon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Your paycheck,\" said Betty. \"As soon as I saw that ridiculous amount,\nit was obvious that there was gross mismanagement here. It had to be\nJeffers.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver groaned.\n  \n \n  \"Then, on the way over here, he as good as admitted everything. You\ndidn't hear him, I guess. Well, he seemed to be caught all unaware, and\nseemed to blame you for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure!\" grumbled the pilot. \"He thinks I told you he was grafting or\nsmuggling, or whatever he has going for him here. That's why I want to\nget out of here\u2014before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal\naccident!\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you know about the crooked goings-on here?\" asked Betty after\na startled pause.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" retorted Tolliver. \"Except that there are some. There are\nrumors, and I had a halfway invitation to join in. I think he sells\nthings to the mining colonies and makes a double profit for himself by\nclaiming the stuff lost in transit. You didn't think you scared him\nthat bad over a little slack managing?\"\n  \n \n  The picture of Jeffers huddled with his partners in the headquarters\nbuilding, plotting the next move, brought Tolliver to his feet.\n  \n \n  There was nothing in the unused office but an old table and half a\ndozen plastic crates. He saw that the latter contained a mess of\ndiscarded records.\n  \n \n  \"Better than nothing at all,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  He ripped out a double handful of the forms, crumpled them into a pile\nat the doorway, and pulled out his cigarette lighter.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're up to?\" asked Betty with some concern.\n  \n \n  \"This plastic is tough,\" said Tolliver, \"but it will bend with enough\nheat. If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\"\n  \n \n  He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with more papers.\n  \n \n  \"You know,\" he reflected, \"it might be better for you to stay here.\nHe can't do much about you, and you don't have any real proof just by\nyourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll come along with you, Tolliver,\" said the girl.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think you'd better.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... after all, what would he dare do? Arranging an accident to\nthe daughter of the boss isn't something that he can pull off without a\nlot of investigation. He'd be better off just running for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not argue about it,\" said Betty, a trifle pale but looking\ndetermined. \"I'm coming with you. Is that stuff getting soft yet?\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver kicked at the edge of the door experimentally. It seemed to\ngive slightly, so he knocked the burning papers aside and drove his\nheel hard at the corner below the hinge.\n  \n \n  The plastic yielded.\n  \n \n  \"That's enough already, Tolliver,\" whispered the girl. \"We can crawl\nthrough!\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Betty first disguises as the president\u2019s daughter. She is five feet four, and her hair was a shade too blonde; she has blue eyes and is wearing gray slacks with a heavy sweater. She comes to Ganymedan to learn about traffic routing as well as business management of local branches. Betty is shocked by the exaggerated description that Tolliver gives on the tractor about how dangerous Ganymedan is. Once she arrives in the office, she fires Jeffers stating that she knows that he has been doing. Making Jeffers very angry, he locks her along with Tolliver into the empty office. There, Betty follows Tolliver to escape to the control room. Once she is told that they will take off, she refuses. But, in order to escape, Tolliver takes off the ship into an economy orbit for Earth anyway. Betty finally makes the microphone call to Space Patrol, telling them to capture Jeffers. From the way that the other side of the phone reacted to Tolliver calling Betty Miss Koslow, Tolliver realizes that something\u2019s off. Then Betty tells him that she actually works for a private investigating firm, and her name is Betty Hanlon. Betty ",
        "Summary_2": "Betty arrives to the dome area and is picked up by Tolliver. During the tractor ride back to the dome from her ship, Tolliver attempts to scare her and makes the area sound incredibly dangerous. During their ride, Betty tells Tolliver why she has been sent to this branch. Betty states that her dad wants her to learn the traffic routing and the business management within a local branch of Koslow Spaceways. When they arrive at the air lock, scared from Tolliver\u2019s stories, she asks Tolliver to guide her to manager\u2019s office. Once she reaches Jeffers office, she immediately accuses him of being crooked and wants him gone from his position. One of her first hints came from when she saw Tolliver\u2019s paycheck and its value. She explains to Jeffers that she may look innocent but she is smart and details how she has evidence that he is doing his job improperly. \n\nJeffers responds and orders both Tolliver and Betty to be locked up. They end up in an empty office near a warehouse building. When Tolliver begins to plan his escape from the room, Betty insists on joining Tolliver much to his dismay. They exit on Ganymede\u2019s surface where Betty proves to have trouble running on the ice in a low gravity environment. After successfully grabbing spacesuits to wear and escaping the warehouse, Betty tells Tolliver that she can get significant help from an emergency number she was given by her father. She just needs to find a TV to make the call. They exit the dome and run across the ice to make it towards Betty\u2019s ship. On the ship, Tolliver learns that the woman\u2019s name is actually Betty Hanlon and not the daughter of Koslow. \n\nEventually, Tolliver guides the ship through take off and explains to Betty that they will be on a long orbit path of 6 months. Betty is upset about the return to Earth and the length of the journey. She admits to Tolliver that she is better handling a pistol than being able to cook. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Betty meets Tolliver on Ganymede in the beginning of the story. He drives her from the city to the spaceport in a tractor. Betty behaves like a typical daughter of a home-office: she tries to speak and behave like a spacer, wears a spacesuit and wants to understand how everything around works to be useful. She scorns Tolliver's job and doesn't consider it serious until he scares her with exaggerated stories and shows his significant paycheck. Then he takes the girl to Jeffers, who treats her with utmost sweetness. There Betty directly accuses Jeffers of his manipulations and says he'll be fired. For this statement she gets locked up together with Tolliver, who manages to escape, and Betty follows him. The two put on the spacesuits and get into a spaceship which takes off due ton Tolliver. From there the girl calls Space Patrol and asks them to help arrest Jeffers, it turns out she is an investigator, not a daughter of the high-standing man.

Betty decides to join Tolliver, and the two run to the spaceship. On the ship, Betty calls Space Patrol and orders Jeffers to be arrested.

The further refusal makes Jeffers put Johnny to some boring job such as driving tractors with relative of home-office. Later, Jeffers meets Betty, a daughter of a very influential man. He treats her sweetly until she accuses him of his crimes. Then he calls for his men to lock up the girl and Tolliver in order to give him time to think. Jeffers plots the next moves and orders to watch out for the prisoners. After a while, Betty calls Space Patrol to request arresting Jeffers. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins in Jeffers' office, where he meets with his employee, Johnny Tolliver, and offers him a part in his scheme where he steals from his cargo ships for profit. Tolliver refuses to join, and Jeffers then lays Tolliver off his space pilot assignment, and instead places him to drive tractors. A few days later, Jeffers is met by Tolliver and Betty in his office. Jeffers happily greets Betty as Miss Koslow, but Betty instead threatens to have Jeffers fired. Afraid of being found out, Jeffers captures the two and keeps them in an office. However, they soon escape and Jeffers is ordered to be arrested."

Even\nthough the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringing\nalong enough fuel to head back would be something else again.\n  \n \n  \"We'll just have to ride it out,\" he said sympathetically. \"The ship is\nprovisioned according to law, and you were probably going back anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't expect to so soon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, you were pretty lucky.

Take the fellow who used to drive this\nmission!\"\n  \n \n  \"You can call me Betty. What happened to him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll tell you some day,\" Tolliver promised darkly. \"This moon can\nstrike like a vicious animal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they told me there was nothing alive on Ganymede!\"\n  \n \n  \"I was thinking of the mountain slides,\" said the pilot. \"Not to\nmention volcanic puffballs that pop out through the frozen crust where\nyou'd least expect. That's why I draw such high pay for driving an\nunarmored tractor.\"\n  \n \n  \"You use armored vehicles?\" gasped the girl.\n  \n \n  She was now sitting bolt upright in the swaying seat. Tolliver\ndeliberately dipped one track into an icy hollow. In the light gravity,\nthe tractor responded with a weird, floating lurch.\n  \n \n  \"Those slides,\" he continued. \"Ganymede's only about the size of\nMercury, something like 3200 miles in diameter, so things get heaped up\nat steep angles. When the rock and ice are set to sliding, they come\nat you practically horizontally. It doesn't need much start, and it\nbarrels on for a long way before there's enough friction to stop it. If\nyou're in the way\u2014well, it's just too bad!\"\n  \n \n \n   Say, that's pretty good!\n   \n  he told himself.\n   \n   What a liar you are,\nTolliver!\n   \n \n \n  He enlarged upon other dangers to be encountered on the satellite,\ntaking care to impress the newcomer with the daredeviltry of John\nTolliver, driver of \"missions\" across the menacing wastes between dome\nand port.\n  \n \n  In the end, he displayed conclusive evidence in the form of the weekly\npaycheck he had received that morning. It did not, naturally, indicate\nhe was drawing the salary of a space pilot. Betty looked thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"I'm retiring in six months if I'm still alive,\" he said bravely,\nedging the tractor into the airlock at their destination. \"Made my\npile. No use pushing your luck too far.\"\n  \n \n  His charge seemed noticeably subdued, but cleared her throat to request\nthat Tolliver guide her to the office of the manager. She trailed along\nas if with a burden of worry upon her mind, and the pilot's conscience\nprickled.\n  \n \n \n   I'll get hold of her after Jeffers is through and set her straight\n   \n  ,\nhe resolved.\n   \n   It isn't really funny if the sucker is too ignorant to\nknow better.\n   \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Firstly, Tolliver takes Betty towards Jeffers\u2019 office on a tractor since it can go through the frozen surface of Ganymede. Then later, when Betty and Tolliver were put in the empty office, Tolliver uses a lighter to light up the mess of discarded records so that the plastic can be bent. Later, inside the storage room, Tolliver finds some spacesuits for the two to wear. Then finally, when they gets to the control room, they gets onto the acceleration seat. Using the ship, the two fly into the economy orbit for Earth in order to escape. In the end, Betty uses the scanner and microphone to make a call to the Space Patrol so that they will arrest Jeffers. ",
        "Summary_2": "Tolliver is a pilot, but while at the Ganymede branch he drives a tractor. One of the equipment used during the story is the automatic flight. An automatic flight allows loaded ships to take a slow and economical orbit using automatic signaling equipment towards Earth. As the loaded ship gets closer to Earth, it is boarded by pilots that land the ship. Another piece of equipment mentioned are spacesuits. The spacesuits involve valves and seals and microphones for people to communicate with each other in the spacesuits. The communication is activated by a switch under the chin on the helmet of the spacesuit. They also come with a heavy knife. ",
        "Summary_3": "Various types of transportation are used throughout the story - tractors to travel on Ganymede between the city and the spaceport, spaceships requiring a lot of fuel and economy orbits which require less fuel but take much longer to get to the place. In a storeroom there are plenty spacesuits, some of which need replacement. Knives are standard suit equipment. Spaceships are equipped with airlocks, ladders and switch-cover. In the control room there is an acceleration seat, a button to set off, a radio and TV, with a screen to see the other side of the call. ",
        "Summary_4": "Tolliver is first assigned to use an airtight tractor to transport to and from the spaceport. This tractor is like a regular one, but built specifically to trek across Ganymede with its gravity. When Tolliver and Betty are locked into Jeffers' office, he uses a lighter and paper to bend the plastic of the door. Then, he uses a knife to cut through the plastic of the dome. Finally, Tolliver and Betty board a ship, where the orbit is automatically preset in order to preserve fuel. The ship, which Tolliver knows how to operate, is airlocked. Betty uses a transmitter to contact Space Patrol."

It had been built for Ganymede, but not for Jeffers.\n  \n \n  \"Aw, it's not like that,\" the manager muttered. \"You can ease out\nwhenever your contract's up. Think we'd bend a good orbit on your\naccount?\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver stared at him silently, but the other had difficulty meeting\nhis eye.\n  \n \n  \"All right, then!\" Jeffers snapped after a long moment. \"If you want it\nthat way, either you get in line with us or you're through right now!\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't fire me,\" retorted the pilot pityingly. \"I came out here\non a contract. Five hundred credits a week base pay, five hundred for\nhazardous duty. How else can you get pilots out to Jupiter?\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay I can't fire you legally\u2014as long as you report for work,\"\ngrumbled Jeffers, by now a shade more ruddy. \"We'll see how long you\nkeep reporting.

Sit in\nyour quarters and see if the company calls\n   \n   that\n   \n  hazardous duty!\"\n  \n \n  \"Doesn't matter,\" answered Tolliver, grinning amiably. \"The hazardous\npart is just being on the same moon as you for the next six months.\"\n  \n \n  He winked and walked out, deliberately leaving the door open behind him\nso as to enjoy the incoherent bellowing that followed him.\n  \n \n \n   Looks like a little vacation\n   \n  , he thought, unperturbed.\n   \n   He'll come\naround. I just want to get back to Earth with a clean rep. Let Jeffers\nand his gang steal the Great Red Spot off Jupiter if they like! It's\ntheir risk.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Tolliver began to have his doubts the next day; which was \"Tuesday\"\nby the arbitrary calender constructed to match Ganymede's week-long\njourney around Jupiter.\n  \n \n  His contract guaranteed a pilot's rating, but someone had neglected to\nspecify the type of craft to be piloted.\n  \n \n  On the bulletin board, Tolliver's name stood out beside the number\nof one of the airtight tractors used between the dome city and the\nspaceport, or for hauling cross-country to one of the mining domes.\n  \n \n  He soon found that there was nothing for him to do but hang around the\ngarage in case a spaceship should land. The few runs to other domes\nseemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.\n  \n \n  The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He swore\nwhen he found the assignment unchanged by \"Friday.\" Even the reflection\nthat it was payday was small consolation.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Johnny!\" said a voice at his shoulder. \"The word is that they're\nfinally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"They say some home-office relative is coming in on the\n   \n   Javelin\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"What's wrong with that?\" asked Tolliver. \"Outside of the way they keep\nhanding out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can go\nback to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reason\nbut them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economy\norbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!\"\n  \n \n  Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under a\nportable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship's\nairlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bags\ninto the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage at\nthe waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.\n  \n \n  She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly even\nin stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade too\nblonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the cap\napparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavy\nsweater, like a spacer.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" she said, sliding into the seat beside\nTolliver. \"By the way, just call me Betty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" agreed Tolliver thinking,\n   \n   Ohmigod! Trying already to be just\none of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer,\nor does he just know where bodies are buried?\n   \n \n \n  \"They were making dates,\" said the girl. \"Were they ribbing me, or is\nit true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true enough,\" Tolliver assured her. \"We need people out here, and\nit costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loaded\nships by 'automatic' flight\u2014that is, a long, slow, economical orbit\nand automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approaching\nEarth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their time\nmaking the entire trip.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "First, the story starts inside Jeffers\u2019 office where the two argues. From the office window, the transparent domes of Ganymede\u2019s can be seen. There is also a chair and a door which is the exit from the room. Then at the empty office next to the warehouse building, Tolliver wakes up. There is an old table and half a dozen plastic crates in the empty office. The plastic crates contain a mess of discarded records. There is also a doorway. The doorway is plastic and can be bended when applied heat. Outside of the room, there\u2019s a storeroom, which has spacesuits inside them. Many of the spacesuits are unpacked while some are standing ready for emergencies. The control room has an acceleration seat. There is a board that has the condition of the ship. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Johnny Tolliver and Jeffers in Jeffers office at the Ganymedan branch of Koslow Spaceways. The office was encapsulated in a transparent dome. Jupiter was more than half a million miles away from the surface of Ganymede. The story begins on a Monday, according to the calendar to match the week long journey it took to go around Jupiter. When Tolliver does get an assignment, it is to take the tractor to bring a home office relative to the airlock at their destination. He does so and brings Betty, the home office relative, to Jeffers office. \n\nAfter Jeffers orders them locked up, they find themselves in an office next to the warehouse building. Tolliver begins to plan their escape and is successfully in getting the door open. Tolliver and Betty walk through to the end of the adjoining warehouse building and find spacesuits in a storeroom for them to wear. After putting on their spacesuits, they leave the warehouse. Tolliver and Betty cut through different layers of the dome and make their way on to the Ganymedan surface. As they get onto the Ganymedan surface, they run across the ice towards Betty\u2019s ship.

Next day he comes to the bulletin board to see his tasks. In a couple of days he is ordered to drive a home-office relative. He loads trunks and bags into his tractor and drives a girl from her dome. He maneuvers out of it and heads toward the city domes. The gravity is light all around. The two walk again into Jeffers' office. Then they find themselves on the floor of an empty locked office in a warehouse building. There is only a table and some plastic crates. When they escape, the two head to a storeroom for spacesuits. Through a rear door they go out, cross an open lane between buildings and reach the main dome. They squeeze inside where there is air pressure and low gravity, so it's extremely hard to run there. They open a spaceship airlock and get in through a ladder.  In the control room there is an acceleration seat, a button to set off, a radio and TV, with a screen to see the other side of the call.

        "Summary_1": "Joe is at a bar and hands a girl $50 to complete a task for him without telling her what it is yet. He makes small talk to the girl telling her that he is trying to get drunk but he can\u2019t because his drinks are watered down by the CPA robot bartenders. Joe informs the girl that he is assigned a DCT (Dangerous Criminal Tendencies) designation on his CPA ID card. Joe leads the girl to an alley to move his plan into motion. His plan is for her to say that he attempted to rape her because attempted rape is a crime under CPA rules. The girl states that she does not want to go along with that plan because she will lose her rank in the Women\u2019s Self-Defense Association, which is a branch of the CPA. Joe still persists and tries to make her scream. The girl in turn successfully defends herself against him and causes his head to strike the hard concrete floor. He loses consciousness of her actions. \n\nJoe wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office. Joe\u2019s plan does not work because the CPA had microphones monitoring the alley so they already know that the plan was not real. Joe then proceeds to confess to a conspiracy when presented with the evidence the CPA has gathered. As a result of these actions, Joe\u2019s new designation on his CPA ID card has the words \u2018Dangerous Criminal Tendencies\u2019 in all caps and in a large, red font printed on his card. It also added that he was a DCT First Class owner. Hendricks lectures Joe about his new designation, but Joe does not care to hear him. The commissioner tries to convince Joe to leave New York or to use the free psychology service. \n\nHendricks explains that he cannot think of a way to help Joe without committing a crime himself. In an unexpected move, Hendricks offers Joe a seemingly available victim and their address. Joe memorizes the available information and goes to the address to commit a crime. Joe enters the apartment and takes a watch. He then shouts outside a window that there is a thief. Joe proceeds to run down to the street and is caught by a police helicopter and handcuffed. \n\nJoe eventually wakes up after months of treatment in a hospital and is picked up by Hendricks. He goes through the large crowd waiting to meet him upon exiting the hospital and has an uneasy feeling about the interactions. He is confused by the reaction of the crowd. Hendrick says that it was a fake apartment that Joe went to and is one that the police use for special cases like his when a person refuses to find a solution. Joe becomes upset because he realizes that he has become a prisoner in his own body because of the treatment from the CPA and he has great contempt for the results. \n",
        "Summary_2": "A girl goes up to Joe Harper's table in a tavern and says that Hank said that Joe wanted to see her. He gives her fifty dollars and tells her that he wants her to do a quick job for him. Joe has been trying to get drunk all afternoon because he will get free room and board for a month from the AAA. The girl wonders why he doesn't just get a job but hands her his CPA ID card. She sees that he has Dangerous Criminal Tendencies, which she then realizes why. The CPA does not punish criminals and focuses more on preventing crime. Therefore, criminals who get convicted are sent to hospitals where all criminal tendencies are removed from the mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, and many other devices. However, these criminals are also hailed as heroes once they have left the treatment program. The girl agrees to his plan, and they go to the alley. He rips her clothes off and tells her to accuse him of rape. However, she cannot agree to the plan because she is a sergeant of the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA). He doesn't want to hear it but, she sends him flying through the air. Commissioner Hendricks speaks to him when he wakes up at the police commissioner's office, and Joe confesses to conspiracy. The crime has been prevented, but his new ID card now has DCT written in even larger red font. This signifies him as a DCT First Class, which means that many other amateur cops will begin to watch him in hopes that he will commit a crime. He further taunts Joe and says that all sorts of people on the street will ask about him and that his life is over because he is a freak. When Joe says that he is broke, Hendricks offers to loan him some money. Although both want to see Joe convicted, Hendricks cannot directly help him because it is either a Violation of Civil Rights or will cause him to commit a crime. However, as soon as Hendricks leaves to get water, Jon flips through Hendricks' book and finds somebody to rob. He goes to John Gralewski's apartment to steal a watch and is arrested promptly by the police. The story then goes to Hendricks telling Jon to wake up and that his treatment is now over. Jon says that he does not feel like a hero, while Hendricks tells him that they only admire him because he will never commit another crime again. When they get inside the car, Hendricks tells Jon that he will have the job he has always wanted now, but the treatment has written a set of laws in his mind that prevents him from committing crimes. Joe now realizes how lousy this system is and wants out of it, but it is too late. He demands to get out of the car and realizes he has become a prisoner with himself. ",
        "Summary_3": "A relatively beautiful girl sits down at Joe's table in the bar and gets paid for some future job. Joe tells her he is trying to get drunk, but the robot-bartender keeps watering his drink as being drunk is illegal. The plan is to join AAA and to live there for free for a month, but there are clever robots in every bar in New York. The girl suggests finding a job and learns that Joe had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCT), which is visible in his ID card. Joe wants the girl to help him commit a crime which is almost impossible as CPA prevents every crime by various means. Those few who succeed are not punished but given treatment in hospitals after which they become perfect employees wanted by every company. Joe and the girl go out into the alley and the man asks her to scream to make everything look like an attempted rape. Nevertheless, the girl refuses as she was taught self-defense and is a sergeant, a rank she doesn't want to lose. When Joe tries anyway, the girl beats him down and police comes soon. They had a hidden microphone nearby and don't believe in the attempted rape story. Conspiracy is not considered a crime and Joe's ID has a larger DCT inscription now - a first class one. This means more cops will watch him as a hobby, as well as neighbors and other people. Hendricks, the police officer, suggests Joe gets the free treatment and then shows a small book with the contacts of nor properly protected people, listed in order to fix that blind spots. After leaving the book on the table, the officer goest to the nest room to get some water, and leaves Joe with the opportunity. Soon, Joe visits one of the listed apartments, an old building with an unreported new room. Joe steals a watch from there and screams for help, then runs and gets caught. After a while, Joe wakes up from a nightmare and sees Hendricks, who announces the end of treatment. The treatment lasted for months and made Joe feel more relaxed but nothing more. A huge crowd is waiting outside to cheer the ex-criminal for his newly gained honesty and inability to commit crime. A woman in the crowd blesses Joe for not committing a murder, which confuses him, as ex-murderers are even more cheered. Then Hendricks explains that he didn't do Joe a favor but such help in crimes is to prevent huger damages from those who refuse free treatment and want to be Exes, as they see those as heroes. Turns out an Ex has to work harder than other people and they still want to commit crime but the laws sound in their heads and prevent it causing pain. CPA is everywhere. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Joe paying a girl fifty dollars, asking her to do a job for him. He does not describe what the job is, but mentions that it will only takes a few minutes. Joe tries to get drunk, but is unsuccessful because the CPA robots prevent anyone from getting too drunk. Then we learn that the CPA is a system that prevents crimes from occurring. It has been very successful. Only a few hundred of crimes has occurred in the past year. Those that did commit a crime are considered heroes, and they are not punished because they outsmarted the system. Instead, they will be put in a CPA hospital for treatments. Afterward, they will be provided with some of the most paid jobs. Joe and the girl goes into the alleyway where he attempts to rape her. She tells him that he cannot do this. But he continues because he wants to get the treatment for a nice job. But because the girl refuses to corporate, she hits him and he drops to the ground. He wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office where his conspiracy is revealed through a hidden speaker in the alley. His CPA card is changed to a First Class DCT. After Commissioner Hendricks explains the troubles he will have as a First Class, Hendricks reveals the address to an unprotected property. Then Joe decides to rob the place. After stealing a watch, he purposely let himself get caught. When he wakes up again, his treatment at the CPA hospital is over. As he gets ready to go home, Hendricks tells him about the truth of the treatment: he simply cannot break any rules because his brain does not let him. "

The CPA organization has made crime nearly impossible through various methods of surveillance and intelligence gathering. The crime was not punished by the CPA but addressed by sending the person to a hospital for expensive treatment to correct and remove the deviance from the person\u2019s mind. A CPA ID card is required to be carried by everyone and when asked, a person has to present the ID card. Being drunk is illegal according to the rules of the CPA. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Crime Prevention Association is an organization that stops crime. Instead of capturing criminals, the goal of the Association is to prevent the crime from ever happening. They implement thousands of crime-prevention methods and devices. There are many amateur cops who constantly follow criminals around in hopes of catching them in the act so that they may be hailed a hero and given a promotion. Hendricks even explains that the kids have junior CPA clubs, where they record the criminals in little cardboard boxes. They will also follow the criminals around until they die. There are millions of microphones hidden by the CPA everywhere, and any threatening messages are sent to the CPA Brain. The CPA Brain is a monster electronic calculator that can alert police helicopters of any threatening messages, and there are also many hidden TVs and metal detectors. For Arson, heat detectors exist too, and chemical poisoning has made it impossible for people to get poisoned.

        "Summary_1": "This story takes place in New York City. It begins in a bar with Joe drinking and attempting to get drunk on watered-down alcohol. A girl comes up to him to talk about what he is hiring her to do. The two leave the bar and go down a hall into an alleyway where Joe tries to enact his plan of fake committing a crime. When Joe wakes up after losing consciousness, he is in the police commissioner\u2019s office. When Joe leaves the commissioner\u2019s office, he goes to the subway and heads to John Gralewski\u2019s apartment on Orange St. The apartment has a new wall that is clean compared to other walls caked with dirt and stains. He notices that the building is old with wide hallways. After Joe is caught by the police, he is taken to the hospital for his treatment that lasts months. When Joe wakes up, he sees that there is a crowd of people outside of the hospital waiting to meet him. Joe leaves the hospital in a car with Hendricks but becomes so upset that he eventually exits the car and stands on the sidewalk where he comes to his realization of his imprisonment in his own body. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in New York in the United States. The girl and Jon initially meet in a tavern with tables, and there are robot CPA bartenders serving drinks. Then, Jon and her go to a dark alleyway, where he attempts to get her to frame him for rape. When he wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office, the place is devoid of any furniture except for a desk and chairs. The walls are lined with television screens, electronic calculators, and many other machines that are a part of New York\u2019s mechanical police force. There is also a slot for old ID cards to be accepted and print new ones. In the next room, there is also a water cooler. Jon goes through the subway briefly, and the darkened city makes him feel ill because it means that the CPA could be hiding anywhere. There are huge atomic power plants scattered around the country to control the advanced system and supply endless electricity for only four dollars a year. When he reaches apartment 204 at 2141 Orange Street, there is a dimly-lit hallway and new walls. The building is old, and the owner had constructed a wall across the hall. Although it is supposed to be wired with CPA burglarproof devices, the owner has not paid for it. There is also a cubbyhole, but the room itself is barely large enough for a bed, chair, and bureau. The place has old underwear and magazines in the bureau; however, there is a watch buried underneath the pile. At the hospital, there is a large window to look out of. There is a large crowd below the hospital steps; many ask for Joe\u2019s autograph, give him gifts, or take photos. The car that rides is robot-chauffeured, and they later pass by a CPA playground. There are girls and boys playing while CPA psychologists stand on the side. Later, the car drops him off at a sidewalk and goes back into the sea of traffic. \n",

There are hidden microphones and police come soon. Joe is taken to the police commissioner's office - a large room almost unfurnished with a huge amount of machines along the walls. Wen the officer leaves to the next room, Joe takes a look at the small book with names and addresses and goes out. He goes to the subway through the dark city which makes him uneasy. Then he reaches apartment 204 at 2141 Orange street in New York. The building is old and dim but the apartment room is new. The place is small, just enough for a bed, chair and bureau. There is nothing to steal except underwear and old magazines, but Joe finds a watch soon. He runs out and is caught by police, who handcuff him in a helicopter. A couple months later Joe wakes up in a hospital after the end of his treatment. A huge crowd is waiting outside, and it takes a long while to get through it. Joe and Hendricks get into the least's robot-chauffeured car and pass various CPA sites until Joe exits on the street, unable to handle all that has happened. ",

        "Query": "What is the story of THE FROZEN PLANET and how does Retief play a crucial role in it?",
        "Article": "Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a\ncovered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man\nwith a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled\ngray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.\n  \n \n  \"Lessee your boarding pass,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.\n  \n \n  The guard blinked at it.\n  \n \n  \"Whassat?\"\n  \n \n  \"A gram confirming my space,\" Retief said. \"Your boy on the counter\nsays he's out to lunch.\"\n  \n \n  The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back\nagainst the handrail.\n  \n \n  \"On your way, bub,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a\nright into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and\nwent to his knees.\n  \n \n  \"You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked\npast while you were resting your eyes.\" He picked up his bag, stepped\nover the man and went up the gangway into the ship.\n  \n \n  A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Up there.\" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way\nalong the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.\nThe door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the\nfloor. It was expensive looking baggage.\n  \n \n  Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,\nflorid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in\nthe open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man\nclamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out.\" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as\nhe backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.\n  \n \n  \"What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?\" he barked. \"Never mind! Clear\nout of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too bad,\" Retief said. \"Finders keepers.\"\n  \n \n  \"You nuts?\" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. \"I said it's Mr.\nTony's room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll see about you, mister.\" The man turned and went out. Retief\nsat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in\nthe corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an\noversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,\nglanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.\n  \n \n  \"All right, you. Out,\" he growled. \"Or have I got to have you thrown\nout?\"\n  \n \n  Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a\nhandle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved\nthe trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Catch,\" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the\nfar wall of the corridor and burst.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The\nface of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, you must be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"If you'll excuse me,\" Retief said, \"I want to catch a nap.\" He flipped\nthe door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>The mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n  \n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started\npunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n  \n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll\ntell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in.\nWe're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob\none this way....\"\n  \n \n  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the\ncontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over\u2014one way or another.\"\n  \n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n  \n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n  \n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n  \n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n  \n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n  \n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n  \n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of\nshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the\nping of hot metal contracting.\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire\u2014\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n  \n",

As a precaution, Retief checks out a needler to take with him. At the airport, he is told that the flight to Jorgensen\u2019s World is fully booked and that he should try again in a couple of weeks; by then, the alien invasion will be over. Under pressure, the clerk tells Retief that the ship is booked for a VIP, and all tourist reservations are canceled. Retief goes to the gate for the flight and punches the ticket taker, forcing his way onto the airship. \n\tRetief makes his way to a room full of expensive luggage and is discovered by Mr. Tony, the man who has claimed the room. When Mr. Tony\u2019s henchmen try to force Retief out of the room, he hefts a large trunk at them and then tosses all the luggage into the hallway. Next, the Captain appears and tries to throw Retief off the ship, but Retief claims the right of the passage under Section Three, Paragraph One of the Uniform Code. The henchmen and the Captain give up for now.\n\tAt dinner, the wait staff ignore Retief, but the chef, Chip, provides him with an excellent meal. Chip dislikes the Captain and Mr. Tony, but he knows they won\u2019t replace him because of his excellent culinary skills. Chip befriends Retief and explains the situation to him. He doesn\u2019t know exactly what the Captain and Mr. Tony are up to, but they make frequent trips to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and cut off all tourist travel to the planet. They travel to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds every few weeks but never pick up any cargo. They allow the Soettis, the aliens who are planning an attack on the Worlds, to board the ships and inspect them because the Soettis are in control of the travel lanes to the planet.\n\tWhen Skaw, a Soetti, demands Retief\u2019s travel papers, Retief attacks him and kills him. The Captain is terrified that the Soettis will kill all of them, and Retief urges him to show some backbone. Retief knows the Soettis won\u2019t make a big deal of the death because they don\u2019t want to draw attention to themselves on the eve of their launch against the Worlds. \n\tLater, Chip informs Retief that the Captain has ordered a change of course to skip Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and travel on to Alabaster. Retief must reach the Jorgensen\u2019s population ASAP with news of the impending alien attack, so he goes to the Captain\u2019s cabin, catching him off guard, and makes him change the orders for the crew, keeping the ship on track to the Worlds. To prevent the Captain from changing the order, Retief stays with him in his cabin and uses the threat of his needler as a deterrent.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Councillor Magnan assigns Retief on a mission to Jorgensen's Worlds to warn and prepare them for an attack by the Soetti, an alien species characterized by their long legs, turnip-shaped torsos, snapper arms, and aggressive infiltration of Terrestrial space. Since Jorgensen's Worlds are underdeveloped technologically, Magnan wants Retief to help the Jorgies convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon for their defense. Retief has four weeks to complete his mission. Magnan has booked him a space flight as far as Aldo Cerise, and he warns Retief prior to departure to look out for the Soetti, who are patrolling the customs areas into Jorgensen's Worlds. Retief brings a gun with him in case he encounters trouble. When he arrives to check in to his flight, the clerk informs him that his flight is full, and he has no chance of boarding. Retief finds out the gate number and goes there, knocking out a guard in order to make his way onto the ship. When Retief locates his cabin, he discovers a tall man named Mr. Tony and his henchman, a short, thick-necked man named Marbles are already there. Mr. Tony orders his henchman to remove Retief, but Retief throws his luggage out into the corridor and closes the door. A few minutes later, Marbles returns with the ship's captain and orders Retief to leave the ship. Again, Retief refuses, and the captain's henchmen avoid escalation having seen Retief's previous aggression with Mr. Tony's luggage. At dinner later, the waiters refuse to serve Retief, and he sees the Captain dining with Mr. Tony and his henchmen. Retief meets the ship's chef Chip, who serves him food. Meanwhile, four of Mr. Tony's henchmen come to Retief's table to find out why he wants to go to Jorgensen's Worlds. When Marbles pulls a knife, Chef Chip offers Retief a knife of his own, but he simply punches Marbles in the face, knocking him out. Another thug pulls a gun on Retief, but the Captain defuses the situation, thinking about his career. After everyone leaves, Chip informs Retief that the Captain has a shady business arrangement with Mr. Tony wherein he ferries unknown cargo instead of tourists to Jorgensen's World with frequent visits from the Soetti. Before the conversation has ended, the Captain arrives with a Soetti named Skaw, who wants to question Retief. When Retief refuses to show Skaw his papers, Skaw moves in for the attack, and Retief breaks his slender leg. Skaw flops about the floor until he dies. Horrified, the Captain worries the other Soetti will react violently, but Retief orders him to show them the body of Skaw and some guns, predicting they will retreat. Later, Chip informs Retief that Mr. Tony is deeply upset about Skaw's death, considering they were close business partners; he also tells him the captain has ordered a course-change to bypass Jorgensen's Worlds and head straight to Alabaster. Retief finds the captain and strong-arms him into maintaining his course to Jorgensen's Worlds.",

Magan suggests a show of force against the Soetti is necessary, and details that he has acquired their war plan and weapon schematics. The Soetti will attack the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds in less than four weeks and are already patrolling the trade lanes into them, making Retief\u2019s entry sketchy even while hiding his Corps credentials. Magnan gives him a ticket departing in four hours to the Aldo Cerise to start Retief\u2019s trip. However, Retief has to punch out an attendant to actually get on this ship because his ticket has been voided by \u201cVIPs\u201d booking the train up to capacity and bumping him off. Retief goes to his originally assigned cabin, but it is already full of expensive luggage. Two men tell him it\u2019s Mr.Tony\u2019s room and that he needs to leave. The Captain shows up and tries to tell Retief to leave as well, but Retief cites the Uniform Code law that protects confirmed space on interplanetary vessels. \nRetief meets the chef, Chip, in the dining car as he watches the red-haired Captain eat with a table of men, including Mr. Tony. One of the \u201cthugs\u201d dining with the Captain dips a cigar into Retief\u2019s coffee while walking past, and Retief throws the coffee on him and punches him in the chin. Mr. Tony calls on one of his men, Marbles, to take out Retief and he attacks. Chip offers Retief a knife, but he doesn\u2019t take it. The Captain urges them to stop fighting saying he has his \u201ccharter to consider\u201d.\nChip brings Retief a meal in his cabin, and tells him that the Captain and Mr. Tony are in a crooked business arrangement and haven\u2019t let any tourists into Jorgensen's World in 6-8 months. They only make quick stops and never pick up any cargo. The passengers currently aboard are headed to Alabaster. The Soetti board the vessel, and one of them, Skaw, appears at Retief\u2019s cabin with the Captain and demands his papers. Skaw threatens Retief with snapping claws, but Retief refuses and breaks his leg, which leaks green fluid and kills Skaw. \nThe Soetti don\u2019t retaliate when Skaw\u2019s body is returned to them, but the thugs and Mr. Tony are very angry with the Captain, and force him to pass by Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and go straight to Alabaster. Retief goes to the Captain\u2019s quarters and tries to get him to return to the original course. The Captain initially refuses, but Retief slams his fingers in a drawer and the Captain obliges.

Retief boards a ship on Aldo Cerise without a boarding pass and claims a room that is meant for a man named Mr. Tony. Mr. Tony calls his associates and they attempt to remove Retief from his room but are unsuccessful.

        "Summary_1": "The Soettis are involved in some kind of illegal activity with the Captain and Mr. Tony. The Soettis, nicknamed Sweaties, by humans who dislike them, are an alien species who have been moving deep into the sector where the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds are located. The Soettis are unattractive creatures with skinny legs like a lobster\u2019s and a big chest shaped somewhat like a turnip. They have rubbery heads, and you can see their pulse beating when they get upset. They have tiny arms with toothed pincers at the ends and threaten humans with them. These pincers are incredibly strong and can cut through steel. \nIt has been learned that they are planning to seize Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds by force, a move of open aggression against Terrestrial territory that cannot be overlooked. The headquarters where Retief works has obtained the Soetti War Plan from a defector of Terrestrials who have actually been providing advice to the Soettis, so the plan is for Retief to travel personally to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds to provide them with this information and also with the schematics that will enable them to convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon to protect the planets. Reaching the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds will be challenging because the Soettis are on patrol in the trade lanes where the airships travel to the Worlds. The Soettis look down on Terrestrials and try to assert themselves over them. The Soettis can speak English, so they can communicate with the Terrestrials.\nThe Captain is afraid of the Soettis and worries that when Retief harms Skaw, the Soetties will kill all of the humans. Retief intends for Skaw to go back and tell the other Soettis that they can no longer enter the Terrestrials\u2019 airships and search them. When Skaw dies, the Captain is certain they are done for, but Retief tells him to bluff and show guns when they return the body, and the Soettis will back down. Surprisingly, the Soettis don\u2019t say anything about Skaw\u2019s death, but Mr. Tony is furious. Retief thinks it is good to know that the Soettis are easy to kill.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Soetti are a hostile alien species that have been infiltrating Terrestrial space. Councillor Magnan and his associates have uncovered their plot to seize Jorgensen's Worlds and assign Retief to travel to the underdeveloped planets to help prepare a defense.  The Soetti are tall creatures with skinny legs, big chests, and round, bulbous torsos. Their heads look rubbery and pulse when they are angry. Soettis have two small arms with pincers for hands that are sharp enough to cut through steel. Magnan warns Retief to be on the lookout for Soettis when he boards his flight for Jorgensen's Worlds, since they tend to patrol the customs areas. They also seem to have some kind of business arrangement with the Captain of the ship that ferries to Jorgensen's World and Mr. Tony, a space thug who employs a number of strong men like Marbles to rough up passengers to Jorgensen's Worlds who might get too curious. Chip informs Retief that the Soetti frequently board the ship, although he is not clear as to their purpose. A Soetti named Skaw confronts Retief and asks to see his papers. When Retief refuses the request, Skaw moves in to attack him. Retief discovers a Soetti weakness when he breaks Skaw's slender leg, spilling greenish blood, and ultimately killing Skaw. Retief demonstrates to the Captain how this can be used as leverage against the hostile aliens.",
        "Summary_3": "Soettis are an alien race of lobster-like crustaceans with skinny legs, big chests and rubbery heads that show their beating pulse. They patrol the trade lanes into the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and one of them, Skaw, boards the merchant vessel that Retief is riding on, acting as if he is a Customs Patrol officer. Skaw is tall with tiny hoof-like feet, and a loose mantle that flaps around knobby knees. He wears a metal helmet. Retief easily breaks the joint of one of Skaw\u2019s legs which then leaks green fluid and kills Skaw.\nThey are significant to the story because they are the enemies that Retief is being sent on a Corps mission to clear from the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds where they are mounting a hostile takeover of Terrestrial space. After Retief discovers how easy they are to kill, he knows he can exploit this weakness to succeed on his mission to reclaim Jorgensen's Worlds for Terrestrials.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Soettis are an aggressive species that is attempting to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force. They are much more technologically advanced than the Jorgensen's Worlds, especially when it comes to weaponry. The Soetti look different than the other characters in the story, with skinny legs like lobsters, and big chests that look like turnips. They have hoof-like feet as well. In Retief's quest to defend Jorgensen's Worlds, he finds that they have some kind of shady dealings with Mr. Tony aboard the transport ship from Aldo Cerise."

However, the governing body in this sector of space has received word that an alien race, the Soetti, has plans to seize Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. The governing body isn\u2019t going to sit by and let the aliens take over Terrestrial-occupied territory. Retief is on a mission to deliver information to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds that will enable them to defend themselves from the alien attack, providing them with the Soettis War Plan, a battle plan for the planets, and the schematics that will enable them, in a matter of minutes, to convert their anti-acceleration fields into a powerful weapon. Reaching Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds will be challenging because the Soetti are patroling the trade lanes to the planet.

Technologically underdeveloped, Jorgensen's Worlds make their industries in farming and trading and have nothing in the way of defense against hostile attack. The Soetti plan to seize Jorgensen's Worlds as part of their efforts to continue infiltrating Terrestrial space; this plan was revealed to Councillor Magnan and his associates by a defector from a group of Terrestrials who had been working with the Soetti. Councillor Magnan sends Retief on the four-day trip to help them convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon that may be used to defend themselves against the Soetti. Tourism to Jorgensen's Wolrds has recently come to a stand-still, but a ship piloted by the Captain and occupied by Mr. Tony, his henchmen, and the attendant Soetti ferries frequently to the planets carrying a mystery cargoload.

Most of the population lives on the warmest of the planets, Svea. Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped, populated by mostly farmers or traders, with industry playing only a minor economic role that barely supports the Merchant Fleet to make runs to them. They are significant because they are within Terrestrial space and an alien race, the Soetti, are trying to claim them by hostile takeover which Retief is sent by the Corps to stop.

But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Tony is a tall, florid man with expensive clothes and a massive paunch. He is also used to getting his way. The Captain and Mr. Tony are involved in an illegal deal with the Soettis, so the two men are business associates, although they don\u2019t much like each other. Together, they have cut off all tourism to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds for the past six to eight months; the airlines won\u2019t provide any bookings for passengers; however, the Captain\u2019s airship has at least a dozen empty rooms. Mr. Tony has several henchmen working for him who do his \u201cdirty business\u201d of roughhandling anyone who interferes with Mr. Tony\u2019s business. Whatever their business is, it involves frequent trips to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds without taking any cargo there. Mr. Tony seems to hold power over the Captain.\n\tThe Captain is a thin, leathery-skinned man who wears white ducks, a blue turtleneck, and a peaked cap that he tilts rakishly over one eye. He isn\u2019t a very strong person or leader. He tries to get Mr. Tony\u2019s men to throw Retief off the ship, but they refuse to do so when Retief warns them not to try and when they realize he is the person who picked up Mr. Tony\u2019s trunk and threw it. The Captain has ordered Retief to get off the ship but backs down when the men refuse to touch Retief. He apparently tells the wait staff in the restaurant to refuse service to Retief because they all ignore him. And when the Captain warns Mr. Tony\u2019s henchmen not to shoot Retief on his airship because it could threaten his charter, one of them talks back and tells him he won\u2019t need it for long. Retief has the distinct impression that Mr. Tony has something on the Captain that forces the Captain to cooperate with him and places him at a lower level than Mr. Tony.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Captain and Mr. Tony are friends, which Retief discovers when he sees them dining together and occasionally glancing over at his table as the waiters ignore him. Chip fills him in on their close business association, which includes an arrangement to ferry some unknown cargo to Jorgensen's Worlds. Mr. Tony is a VIP guest on the Captain's ship and takes Retief's room, but Retief kicks him out, which draws the ire of Mr. Tony and his henchmen. It appears that Mr. Tony is a thug whose men work as guards of whatever cargo is being transported to Jorgensen's Worlds. The Captain and Mr. Tony are also working with the Soetti, who visit the ship during each flight, according to Chip. Although the exact details of their plot are never revealed, Retief assumes it has something to do with the Soetti's overall plan to seize Jorgensen's Worlds in their overall infiltration of Terrestrial space. Although the Captain and Mr. Tony are friendly, the Captain is concerned about his charter, and he draws the line when Mr. Tony's men come for Retief with a gun. He calls off his henchman and leaves.",
        "Summary_3": "The Captain is operating a Merchant Vessel transiting between Earth and distant worlds to deliver and retrieve passengers and cargo. However, he has fallen into crooked business with Mr. Tony, who is a violent ring leader closely connected with the Soettis who are trying to violently take control of the Terrestrial space of Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. For the last 6-8 months they have not delivered any tourists to Jorgensen's Worlds, and never pick up any cargo, which is highly suspicious. \nMr. Tony deals closely with the Soettis, and is very upset when the Soetti Skaw is killed and the body has to be returned to them. Skaw boards the Merchant Vessel to check Retief\u2019s papers even though he has no authority, and Retief kills him by breaking his leg joint which leaks green fluid. Mr. Tony and one of his \u201cthugs\u201d, Marbles, yell at the Captain for half an hour in his cabin after this incident and force him to change course to not stop at Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds, demonstrating that Mr. Tony has control over the Captain in their relationship.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The captain has given up control of the ship to Mr. Tony and has basically become one of his underlings. This is most evident when the captain attempts to throw Retief out of Mr. Tony's room and when he attempts to reroute the ship to Alabaster when Retief beats up Mr. Tony's goons. Chip says that the captain has a crooked business agreement with Mr. Tony, but it becomes clear later in the story that the business agreement is really controlled by the Soetti. The captain says he has no control over Skaw, the Soetti that comes aboard the ship, and becomes very nervous when Retief kills Skaw. "

        "Summary_1": "Following the departure of Consul Whaffle, Retief has taken over as Consul for the Terrestrial States with the Terrestrial Consulate General on the planet Groac. His administrative assistant, Miss Yolanda Meuhl, wants him to attend Groacian cultural events, but Retief is more interested in addressing the nine-year-old mystery of the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific--an event which was followed by a coup d'etat enacted by the current Groacian government. Much to Miss Meuhl's dismay, Retief shirks his cultural duties and makes his way to the Foreign Office Archives, whereupon he is promptly barred from entering by a pale-featured Archivist speaking in the throat-bladder vibrations of the native Groacians. Because of the Archivist's insistence that \"outworlders\" cannot access the archives, Retief begins walking back to the Consulate and stops at a bar for a drink. At the, a drunken Groacian approaches Retief and threatens to cage him and put him on display as a freak. The bartender orders the drunken Groacian out of the bar, and Retief follows him, ultimately beating him up for information. When Retief returns to the Consulate, Miss Meuhl informs him that two angry Groaci await him in his office. One is Fith, an employee of the Terrestrial Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the other is Shluh, a representative of the Internal Police. They are there to investigate reports that Retief has assaulted a Groacian national--an accusation Retief ignores in order to launch into his own accusations that the Groaci were engaged in a cover-up of the whereabouts of the ISV Terrific. Miss Meuhl continually interjects, expresses horror at Retief's claims, and apologizes to the Groacians on behalf of the Terrestrial Consulate. Despite the persistent denials of the Groacians, Retief continues his accusations, suggesting the coup d'etat was an effort to silence government officials with knowledge of the truth of what happened to the cruiser and its crew. Then he reveals what he discovered from the drunken Groacian: The crew of the ISV Terrific had been caged and paraded through the streets of Groac and then neglected until they died. Fith and Shluh finally admit the truth and offer to show Retief the hidden cruiser in order to show their contrition. When Retief sees the ship, he once again accuses the Groacians of attempting to mislead him, saying that this is a lifeboat, and he demands to see the actual ship. Fith has had enough and threatens to arrest Retief, who yields and goes back to the Consulate. There, Miss Meuhl is at her wits end. Retief orders her to barricade herself inside the office while he goes to the Foreign Ministry to gather more evidence. When he returns, Miss Meuhl informs him she has reported him to Regional Headquarters, and Retief learns he has been relieved of his post. Soon after, the Groacians appoint Miss Meuhl to his position, and Fith and Shluh enter to arrest him.",
        "Summary_2": "Consul Whaffle left the Terrestrial Consul three months prior, leaving Retief in charge. Retief is sick of the constant cultural events and lack of real progress, so he\u2019s beginning to suspect the Groaci are hiding something. He turns down the latest invitation, offending his Administrative Assistant Miss Meuhl. She is horrified at his choices and at his questioning the Groaci\u2019s motives. Retief wants to learn more about the Terrestrial cruiser, Terrific ISV, that crashed on Groac nine years ago. Miss Meuhl disapproves and believes the Groacian side of the story, but Retief is not convinced. He is turned down at the Archies, as he is an outsider. He leaves and decides to visit a bar and try the local drink. There, Retief is refused by the bartender as well, claiming his stomach can\u2019t handle their drink. A drunk Groacian in the background whispers about putting Retief in a cage where he belongs. He follows the drunk after he gets thrown out and violently interrogates him.\nWhen Retief returns to his office, Miss Meuhl announces that there are two Groaci waiting for him. Fith and Shluh, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Internal Police respectively, have heard about the assaults on a Groacian. Retief asks Miss Meuhl to record their conversation. Retief admits to his questioning, but not before doing some of his own. He prods the two Groaci about the Terrific ISV cruiser and soon reveals that the drunk told him about the zoo-like parade of Terrestrials. Fith admits to the parade and tells them that the Terrestrials died afterward due to insufficient nutrition. The Groaci hid their blunder and lied to the Terrestrials about what truly happened. Retief asks them to take him to the cruiser, which they do. After they explore a little, Fith and Shluh ask him to keep his mouth shut. Retief refuses and says that this ship was the lifeboat, not the cruiser itself. Four armed Groaci surround Retief, but he talks his way out of the situation. \nHe returns to the Consulate and tells Miss Meuhl everything, warning her to prepare for the present crisis. She is still upset and defends the Groaci. He tells her to lock herself in the Consulate and wait for his return. If something were to happen, she is to send the recording and all his evidence to Regional Headquarters. He leaves to break into the Foreign Ministry. When he returns, he asks Miss Meuhl to fire up the sender, which she\u2019d already done. She had reported him to the Regional Headquarters and all his misactions. Counsellor Pardy pops up on the screen and attempts to relieve Retief of his duties, but he quickly shuts it off. Retief says he found the missing cruiser but is interrupted by the local communicator. A Groacian promotes Miss Meuhl to Consul, and she lets in the so-called peace squad.

Retief dictates a response declining a prestigious invitation to a Groacian event to Miss Meuhl, and she warns he will offend them. This is not Retief\u2019s only controversy. He also questions the coup d'etat of the present government and the disappearance of the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, nine years ago, which are considered topics to be avoided by Miss Meuhl. Retief is denied entry into the Foreign Office Archives to investigate, and steps into a local bar. A drunkard Groacian calls Retief a freak and then is escorted out by two other customers. Retief follows the drunk out to the street and pins him down to the ground to have a \u201clong talk\u201d.\nBack in Retief\u2019s consulate office, two angry Groacian officials, Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh, of the Internal Police, accuse Retief of beating the drunkard. Retief has Miss Meuhl officially record the conversation and pivots to ask what happened to the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, that disappeared nine years ago. Fith is offended and calls for Retief to be fired. Retief presses on to ask why the government fell after the visit of a Terrestrial investigation task force after the incident. He notices the Groacians are covering something up - not letting Terrestrials have social contacts outside the diplomatic circle and never speaking of a parade of six Terrestrials hauled through the streets after the vessel disappeared. Fith admits that six Terrans were captured and they fell ill and died because the Groacians didn\u2019t know what to feed them. Fith admits the ship descended intact East of the city, and that they didn\u2019t realize they had done something terrible until the Terran warships came. So they covered their mistake, purging their guilty leaders, concealing what happened, and offering Terrans diplomatic relations.  Fith and Shluh take Retief to see the ship in a cavern, however, it is not the real ISV Terrific. The Terrific was a twenty thousand ton ship, and this one is only a small lifeboat. Fith becomes furious. Shluh and four constables escort Retief back to the city and ban him from leaving or questioning Groacian government matters. \nRetief decides to find what happened to the real Terrific before they destroy all the Archives\u2019 paperwork. He instructs Miss Meuhl to lock herself in the consulate office. She reports Retief to Regional Headquarters. When Retief returns, he wants to send his findings to Regional Headquarters, but when they reconnect, Counsellor Pardy, DSO-1, Deputy Under-secretary for the region fires Retief. Miss Meuhl answers a call from the Groacians who accredit her as the new Terrestrial Consul to Groac (Retief\u2019s role). She lets armed Groacian\u2019s into the consulate and waives diplomatic immunity for Retief. A total betrayal that shocks Retief.",
        "Summary_4": "Consul Retief for the Terrestrial States is serving on the Groac planet, having replaced the previous consul, Mr. Whaffle, three months ago. His Administrative Assistant, Miss Meuhl, tries to tell him how to do his job, indicating what he can and cannot do. She is defensive of the Groacians, calling them sensitive, cultured, innocent, and gentle yet unsophisticated. She professes deep shame at the way they were treated by the investigators. She has been working in the consulate for four years and considers herself much more knowledgeable than Retief. There was a Terrestrial ship, the ISV Terrific, that went missing in their sector nine years ago, and while the Terrestrials held an investigation and questioned the Groacians, they did not get satisfactory answers. Retief is trying to get those answers.\nTo determine what happened, Retief first tries the Archives and local museum, but Terrestrials are denied entry here. From there, he makes his way to a bar. While the bartender refuses him service, a drunken Groacian calls out for a cage to put Retief in, referring to him as a zoo animal or a freak. When the bartender has the drunk taken out of the bar, Retief follows and beats him to get more information. Later, two government men, Fith from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh from the Internal Police, show up at the consulate to question Retief about the beating. He turns their questioning into his own interrogation about the missing ship from nine years ago and the reason for the change in their government right after the investigators left Groac. Retief confronts them with his knowledge that the Terrestrials were put in cages and paraded through the streets and demands to know what happened to them. Fith admits this happened and claims the humans grew ill and died since the Groacians didn\u2019t really know how to keep them alive.\nFith also relates that the government was changed after the inquiry to get rid of the leaders who were involved. To try to cover and make up for their mistakes, they then reached out to the Terrestrials to establish a diplomatic relationship. When Retief asks to see the ship, Fith and Shluh show him a ship hidden in a cavern, but Retief realizes it isn\u2019t the ISV. He confronts the men about this, and they end their cooperation with him. Fith warns Retief to stay close to the consulate.\nKnowing that he has little time left, that night Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry to find evidence and answers to his questions; he is sure they will destroy this information soon. When he returns to the consulate, Miss Meuhl has filed a report against him with the Regional Headquarters, having him relieved of duty and making her acting Consul. Fith and Shluh show up to question Retief about the break-in, and he claims diplomatic immunity, but Miss Meuhl waives his immunity.  \n"

The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition.

And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad.

A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another.

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on the planet Groac, which is populated by the native Groaci. The Groaci is a skinny, pale species with a throat-bladder that vibrates when speaking with a glottal dialect in an unusual syntax. They are a sensitive race, according to Miss Meuhl, and they hide their heads and hurry along at any sign of trouble. Consul Retief has an office in the Terrestrial Consulate General and attends cultural events such as light-concerts, chamber music, and folk-art festivals. Retief suggests that these events are mere distractions from more underhanded business happening on the planet, which explains why visas are handed out for only a few terrestrial businessmen, traveling to outlying districts is forbidden, and social contacts must be limited to the diplomatic circle. Groac also has a moon that foreigners cannot visit. In addition to the Consulate General, other important government agencies exist including the Foreign Office Archives, the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Internal Police (called \"peace-keepers\"). Close to the Consulate General is the bar where Retief goes, seeking a cold drink and information. The bartender stands in the bar-pit and dispenses a Groacian beverage he insists is poisonous to foreigners due to its lead content. Retief brandishes a thick gold piece to act as a filter. Later, Fith and Shluh lead Retief to a crevasse nine miles from the supposed landing point of the ISV Terrific. Due to the large veins of high-grade iron ore, Terrestrial investigators had been unable to detect the cruiser's presence, which had been disguised by a roof of heavy timbers. Retief enters the cruiser via a narrow companionway and sees dust all over the deck, stanchions, instrument panels, sheared bolts, and scraps of wire and paper strewn about the control compartment. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place on the planet Groac inhabited by the Groaci. Previously undiscovered by humans, the Groaci had their first contact with an alien species just nine years prior to the story beginning. The Groaci use ground cars to travel, though they may be considered flimsy. With a cool temperature and clean air, Groac isn\u2019t a terrible place to live. There are mountainous caverns in the terrain as well, and one serves as the hiding spot for the lost Terrific ISV. Retief visits several places and buildings on Groac, including the Consul, their Ministry of Affairs, and a bar, showing their culture does not differ entirely from Terrestrials. The Groaci are often called simple people, however. They have several cultural events, such as folk festivals, chamber choirs, and light concerts. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Madman From Earth is set on the planet of Groac, where the Terrans have had a Terrestrial Consulate General for less than nine years. The consulate contains offices for the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy staff like Retief and Miss Meuhl as well as their living quarters. Relations between the Terrans and the Groacians have been peaceful, but there are some subjects that are off limits to discuss with the Groacians, such as the disappearance of a Terran ship, ISV Terrific, nine years ago. Retief is the new Consul, and is planning on digging into this controversial topic directly with the Groacians, creating a very tense atmosphere.\nIn the city, there are windowless stucco facades on the buildings lining the street, and  the Groacians avoid the Terrans as they pass. There are high-wheeled ground cars and the environment has clean and cool air. Retief enters a Groacian bar that serves clay pots of an alcoholic drink that could harm humans from a pit in the center of the room. When Retief is escorted out of the city by Fith and Shluh, they take him to a natural crevasse with thick veins of high-grade iron ore in the rock that they claim the vessel, ISV Terrific, was lowered into and then it was covered with a roof to avoid detection. The land around the city is dusty like a desert, and Terrans are generally forbidden from traveling through these areas or visiting Groac\u2019s satellite, which is part of their cover-up of what happened to the ISV Terrific.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on the planet inhabited by the Groacians, specifically in the Terrestrial Consulate, a bar, and a cavern. The Consul for the Terrestrial States has been open on the planet for almost nine years, opening not long after the ISV Terrific B7 New Terra Terrestrial cruiser went missing in the sector. The Consul is in a building protected by a safelock and communicates with the Regional Headquarters via a video communication system. The Consul has a needle gun for protection and keeps food and water on hand; it has quarters in the building for the staff as well.\n\tGroac is civilized and orderly. The Groacians have an Archives and museum for their local history, but it is off-limits to Terrestrials. Buildings have deeply carved, windowless stucco facades lining the streets, and Groacs travel by flimsy, high-wheeled ground cars. The air on the planet is clean and cool. Carvings over the doorways of buildings indicate the businesses housed within; one such business is a bar. The bar features a bar pit at the center of the room, and drinks are served in clay pots. They have culture, too, with light concerts, chamber music, and folk-art festivals. There is a Foreign Office that handles foreign matters and maintains files regarding its dealings.\n\tThe Groaci, however, have a deep dislike of Terrestrials. They avoid them on the streets, refuse service, and drunkenly slur insults at them. The Groaci government was overhauled after an investigation of a missing cruiser; after this, the Terrestrial consul was established. \n\tRetief is taken to a cavern to see the ISV Terrific, but it turns out not to be the real ISV Terrific. The Groaci authorities claim they hauled it there, nine miles from where it landed, placing it in a natural crevasse and roofing it over with high-grade iron ore. The ship has curving flanks and a space-burned hull. The instrument panels are empty, bolts have been sheared, scraps of paper and wire are lying around. Cutting torches have been used to remove the heavy shielding.\n"

While both are Groacians, they speak to Retief in a lisping Terran and wear heavy eye-shields and elaborately-decorated crest ornaments indicating their rank. Fith does most of the talking as he attempts to convince Retief to cease his inquiries into the ISV Terrific, and Shluh is there primarily as a tool with which to threaten Retief. When the two Groacians first meet Retief, they accuse him of attacking a Groacian national, which Retief admits to, but he quickly reveals what the national confessed to him about the fate of ISV Terrific's crew. Although Miss Meuhl is sympathetic to the supposed sensitive nature of the Groaci, Retief distrusts them wholly, and when Fith and Shluh eventually confess to hiding the ISV Terrific, he further distrusts their sincerity of contrition and accuses them of showing him a lifeboat instead of the missing cruiser. This accusation infuriates Fith, who threatens to have Shluh's attending officers arrest Retief on the spot. Later, following Retief's break-in at the Foreign Ministry, Fith appoints Miss Meuh as Consul for the Terrestrial States and orders Shluh to arrest Retief.",

Fith and Shluh accompany Retief on his journey of discovering the mystery of the ISV Terrific crash and human discovery on Groac.

Fith reveals that all six of the Terrestrials used in the parade died due to malnourishment and the Groaci\u2019s unfamiliarity with the needs of humans.

They are first introduced when they show up to Retief's Terrestrial Consulate office on Groac to question him about a report of a drunkard who was beaten on the street. Fith\u2019s role is largely to protect the interests of the planet Groac, who Retief is threatening with his offensive investigations into the disappearance of the ISV Terrific, which Groacians claim the Terrans falsely accuse them of capturing nine years ago. Although Fith admits to the cover up of the vessel, it appears he is concealing a much larger secret that Retief uncovers when he notices they are showing him only a small lifeboat from ISV Terrific and claiming that they know nothing further. Then, Fith and Shuhl become forceful and violent with Retief when he presses about the heavy cruising ship - the real ISV Terrific - that the small lifeboat came from. \nShluh commands the Internal Police, and enforces the wishes of Fith faithfully throughout the story. This is seen when Shluh and four of his constables apprehend Retief at the cavern and forcefully escort him back to the city, and again when they enter the Terran consulate armed to take Retief into custody.\n",

When we first see them, the two men question Retief about his beating of the drunk Groacian from the bar, but Retief counters by asking them questions about the ISV Terrific. Retief reveals that the drunken man told him certain information, and Fith indicates he will ask for Retief\u2019s recall and claims he would do more if Retief didn\u2019t have diplomatic immunity. While Retief tells them what he knows and then inquires how the people from the ISV Terrific died, proffering several suggestions, Fith becomes so worked up that he begins answering the questions. He admits the humans died from illness but claims the Groacians tried to keep them alive but didn\u2019t know how. He also asserts that the Groacians were unaware of the severity of their actions until the investigation was held. They were afraid to tell what had happened and hid the ship. When the investigators left, they replaced their government and opened diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. To persuade Retief of their sincerity, Fith offers to show Retief the ship and takes him to a ship hidden in a cavern. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific and confronts Fith with this fact, leading Shluh to have his four armed constables surround Retief. Fith then warns Retief not to go far from the consulate and to drop his inquiries about the government. At the end of the story, the two men come to the consulate to remove Retief for questioning and respond to Miss Meuhl as Consul now. "

        "Summary_1": "The ISV Terrific, full name ISV Terrific B7 New Terra, was a Terrestrial cruiser gone missing nine years prior to the events of the story. The vessel landed on Groac and its crew was captured and paraded through the streets by the Groaci. The crew died of mysterious causes and the vessel was hidden in a cavern and undetectable by investigators thanks to large veins of high-grade iron ore under the planet's surface. After a Terrestrial investigation failed to uncover the cruiser, a Groacian coup d'etat replaced the government in the time before the establishment of the Terrestrial Consulate General. Fith and Shluh deny any wrongdoing related to the deaths of the crewmembers when Retief confronts them about the situation, insisting that the crew died because the Groaci were ignorant about the Terran diet. They do, however, admit that they hid the cruiser. When they lead Retief to the ship, he observes its state of disrepair: A thick layer of dust covers the deck, stanchions, acceleration couches, instrument panels, sheared bolts, and scraps of wire and paper strewn about the control compartment. Then, Retief accuses them of attempting to continue their deception by showing him a lifeboat instead of the actual cruiser. This enrages Fith. The disappearance of the ISV Terrific, the coup d'etat that followed, and the subsequent incompetent Terrestrial investigation had led Retief to conduct the investigation in the first place and ultimately reveal that the Groacians are trying to hide something more sinister.",
        "Summary_2": "The ISV Terrific is a Terrestrial spaceship that crashed on Groac nine years before the story begins. It is significant because it marks the first Terrestrial contact with the Groaci, in fact, the first alien contact at all. The crew of the ISV Terrific were captured and paraded through the streets like animals in a zoo. They all later died due to malnourishment and dehydration, or so the Groaci claim. The ISV Terrific is significant because it acts as the catalyst for much of the conflict in this story, as Retief sets down a path to discover the truth and reveal what was long ago covered up. ",
        "Summary_3": "The ISV Terrific was a heavy, interplanetary cruising vessel, weighing about twenty thousand tons, that was mysteriously lost on the planet Groac nine years ago. When the Terrans questioned the Grocians about their vessel, the Groacians covered up the fact that the ship did land on their planet to the east of the city and there were humans that all died after falling ill because the Groacians did not understand what to feed them. \nThe ISV Terrific is significant in the story because it is Retief\u2019s singular focus to solve its disappearance. Retief is highly suspicious of why his fellow colleagues at the consulate are afraid to investigate the incident any further.  The Groacians treat the incident as an embarrassment, as if the Terrans had wrongly accused them. But Retief is intent on getting to the bottom of it. At first, he is able to get some information from Fith, who admits to covering up the ship and the death of the humans that fell ill. When Retief arrives at the cavern that the Groacians have hidden the ship in, he uncovers a further mystery. The ship they show him is only a hundred-ton lifeboat of the ISV Terrific, marked 'IVS Terrific B7 New Terra\u2019 on the bow. The real ISV Terrific is somewhere else.\nRetief does not give up on his quest, despite the threats of the Groacian officials, and pushes on into the night by breaking into the Archives to obtain the records from nine years ago to find out where the ISV Terrific is.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The ISV Terrific is the reason for Retief\u2019s appointment as Consul on Groac. The ship was a Terrestrial cruiser that went missing nine years ago in the Groaci sector of the galaxy. Consul Retief is trying to track down the ship and discover what happened to the passengers. He suspects that the ship crashed on the Groaci\u2019s planet and that the Groaci killed the people on it. He is on a mission to answer these questions. He first asks Miss Meuhl what she knows about it. She refuses to discuss it, siding with the Groacis and defending them as a very sensitive race and stating she is ashamed of how they were treated when the investigation was conducted. Retief tries to enter the Archives and local museum to search for information but is denied entry. \nBut he stumbles on a clue in a bar when a drunken Groaci points at him and says they need to find a proper cage for him; Retief follows the drunk out of the bar and learns that the Groaci captured the passengers and caged, paraded, and exhibited them. Fith and Shluh admit that these Terrestrials died but that the Groaci tried to keep them alive but didn\u2019t know what foods they ate. They fell ill one by one and died. The Groaci claim that they didn\u2019t realize the significance of the humans until the warships came to investigate, and then the Groaci were afraid to say anything. Afterward, they got rid of their government, replaced it with a new one, hid the ship, and invited diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. Fith and Shluh also reveal that the ship didn\u2019t crash but landed intact and claim that the ship is hidden in a cavern now and offer to show it to Retief. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific  but is, instead, a lifeboat. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry during the night and finds answers to his questions, but before he can transmit the information that he has learned, Miss Meuhl notifies the Regional Headquarters of his actions, having him removed as consul, and allows the Groaci into the consulate to take Retief into custody.\nThus, the ISV Terrific is the basis for interplanetary hostilities, the opening of a diplomatic channel between the Groacians and the Terrestrials, the overthrow of the Groaci government, and an unsolved mystery that could reopen hostilities when the truth of the matter is revealed.\n"

Miss Meuhl wears glasses, uses a dictyper, and takes her position at the Consulate extremely seriously. She faithfully executes her duties as an administrative assistant without question, which leads her to develop a blind trust in authority as well as the Groaci race, according to Retief.  Miss Meuhl considers the Groaci to be a sensitive race and defends them against Retief's constant accusations of misconduct. She threatens to report Retief to the Regional Headquarters when he continues to act against the guidelines set forth by the Corps. Her commitment to diplomatic relations ensures that she takes the side of the Groaci in nearly every matter; she even excuses when Fith and Shluh admit to hiding the Terrestrial cruiser. When Retief orders Miss Meuhl to lock herself inside the office while he goes to break into the Foreign Ministry, Miss Meuhl calls the Regional Headquarters and makes a full report of his actions. When he returns, Counsellor Pardy calls and relieves Retief of his post. Then, a Groacian official calls and appoints Miss Meuhl to the post vacated by Retief, which she accepts.

Miss Meuhl does not approve of his actions and argues with Retief throughout the entire story. In the end, Miss Meuhl essentially betrays his trust and allows the Groaci to take Retief away, making her the new Consul.

She objects to nearly everything that Retief does during the course of the story, and only obliges when the task might gain her some information she can use against Retief in the future.

When Retief brings up questions about the replacement of the government and the Groacis\u2019 role in the missing ISV Terrific, Miss Meuhl sides with the Groaci, stating that they are a very sensitive, cultured, gentle race and were treated very poorly during the inquiry that followed the disappearance of the ship. When Fith and Shluh arrive to question Retief about his role in beating a Groaci, she is appalled. She refuses to be a party to his conversation with the authorities until Retief forces her because he needs her to record the discussion. When Retief leaves with the authorities to see the ship, he trusts Miss Meuhl to transmit the recording to the Regional Headquarters if he doesn\u2019t return in a reasonable amount of time. When Retief later continues his investigation under cover of night, he warns Miss Meuhl she is in danger and not to leave the consulate; he also warns her not to trust the Groaci.

He finds himself staring around a dark, silent room full of indeterminate objects. He believes he hears a faint voice in the distance, and suddenly a pinkish light illuminates his path of vision. He sees many familiar objects including a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a girl's bathing suit, and more; he wonders how he got there and why such objects are there with him. Three of the room's walls are made of a hard, organic compound, and from grates comprising the fourth wall pours a pungent air. As McCray's confidence returns, he wonders what happened to the Starship Jodrell Bank and begins to wonder if he is dead. When he remembers spacesuits come with radios, he tries contacting the ship to no avail and realizes he must be many lightyears away. Then, with sudden horror, he realizes that he cannot see his own body, and the room goes dark again. Outside the room, an alien named \"Hatcher\" runs a probe team tasked with observing McCray and running experiments on him in order to develop an understanding of the human species. Their \"probes\" are mandibles that can attach and detach from their round, jelly-like bodies and run errands and conduct scientific research. Hatcher makes his way to the supervising council of all probes to report the team's findings that McCray displayed \"paranormal powers\" when using his radio to establish contact with his ship. The council urges Hatcher to continue his studies with haste because a member of The Central Masses probe team has been captured by the Old Ones, an ancient species hostile to Hatcher's people. His team must put McCray through a series of tests in order to help them potentially discover a way to defend themselves against the Old Ones. As Hatcher considers the best way to establish communication with McCray without causing him harm, his assistant alerts him to the presence of a female human on the viewing console. Hatcher orders the assistant to bring her in as they may need another human in case McCray dies. Hours after his initial transmission was sent to the ship, McCray receives a response from the ship. He dispatches another transmission and begins to notice the room getting hotter as the air grows more toxic. Hatcher has started the survival portion of the test. McCray uses an ax to break his way out of the room and enters another dark room full of desks he assumes are some kind of workspaces for his captors. Suddenly, he hears a woman's voice crying out for the Jodrell Bank and makes his way toward her. Hatcher and his assistant discuss whether to abandon McCray and focus on the female since she appears to be more susceptible to communication, but they ultimately decide against it.

Some he recognizes from his early life, like a childhood rocking chair. He calls for help on the ultrawave radio of the spacesuit, but there is no answer, telling him he is a long way from anything since the range of the radio is hundreds of light-years. McCray is being observed from another room by an alien Probe Team led by Hatcher. They are watching McCray\u2019s every action with fascination. They think he has paranormal powers when he operates the radio and they detect electromagnetic vibrations that are modified by his voice. Hatcher rushes to tell a councillor from the supervising council of all the alien probes about the discovery and he is ordered to establish contact with McCray immediately because they need allies in the race of Old Ones (their word for humans). Hatcher defends going at a slow pace since they have frightened McCray so deeply already, but the concillor does not budge since there has been an incident of one of their staff on the Central Masses probe team getting captured by their human subject. Hatcher\u2019s people are capturing humans from Jodrell Bank because they detected it near their territory and were almost completely destroyed when they last encountered humans. They are now desperate to find ways to fight or escape them.\nBack in McCray\u2019s observation room, he hears a faint voice responding from his ship via the spacesuit radio. This gives him hope, but also panic because he calculates that he must be more than five hundred light-years away from his ship for such a long lag. He radios back, but knows there will be no response for several more hours. The room suddenly gets very hot and a chlorine-like gas is being pumped in that burns his lungs. He quickly puts on the spacesuit which will keep him cool and filter the air, then picks up an axe and breaks out of the room into a hallway. He finds the parts of an antique bullet gun on a bench outside, and then hears a woman scream out to Jodrell Bank for help on his radio.\nThe heat and chlorine gas are a survival test, and McCray passes. McCray uses his radio to locate the woman. He notices that there is a new door where there was not one before. Hatcher has engineered this so that McCray will find the woman and they can study them communicating with each other. Hatcher thinks this is a step toward successful contact with humans.

They have tried working with other humans in the past, but they have all died during the stages of their tests.\n\tThe probe team acquires another test subject, a female, who begins calling out for help. McCray hears her and begins making his way to her. She is unconscious when he finds her, and he suspects that it is from breathing the air in the building.

He sifts through the items on the floor, objects from Earth mostly, and looks at the metal walls. One of the three walls is made up of an organic plastic compound, but the rest are impenetrable. He sees a spacesuit and uses its microphone to emit a distress signal to Jodrell Bank. He hears nothing in response, meaning he must be hundreds of light-years away from them. Suddenly, the light goes out, but not before he realized he couldn\u2019t see his reflection in the spacesuit. As he freaks out, the reader is introduced to Hatcher, the lead alien probe of the team observing Herrel.

Herrell hears a click, feels the room get warmer, and smells something unpleasant. He turns on the light in the spacesuit and is relieved to see his body. Jodrell Bank calls him back, so he sends in a long message explaining his situation. He hears nothing back. He climbs into the spacesuit, realizing the air is toxic, and lets the spacesuit provide fresh air. He grabs an ax off the floor and uses it to break out of the poisonous room. Once out, he tries to open a cupboard in the new area but is unable to. He sees a pistol that had been taken apart before. Jodrell Bank calls back in, but this time a woman responds, calling for help. McCray communicates with her and tracks her using her descriptions. He runs around the compound, trying to find her, and eventually goes through a door that was previously unopened. He finally finds her, unconscious on the floor. "

Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins sometime during the Starship Jodrell Bank's Long Jump from Earth to the colonies surrounding Betegeuses Nine as it passes by Betelgeuse, Rigel, and Saiph. The rest of the action takes place in an unknown area of space within a \"great buried structure\" that is a massive labyrinth of dark rooms and hallways with unusual doors that seem to shift and change after passing through them. This is where Hatcher and his probe team observe McCray in his enclosure, which is no bigger than a prison cell, dark, and full of vaguely familiar objects: a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a chemistry set, a girl's bathing suit, an ax. Three of the walls are made of a hard, organic compound and the fourth is covered in grates from which a halogen-smelling air pours out into the room. Although everything is dark, Hatcher occasionally triggers a pinkish, halo-like light that allows McCray to examine his surroundings. Elsewhere in the structure is a place where the supervising council of all probes stays in permanent session, monitoring the work of all probe teams including the team at The Central Masses. When McCray breaks out of his initial enclosure, he finds himself in another dark room, large and bare. Using the beam from his suit lamp, he sees shelves, cupboard-like contraptions, and level surfaces that appeared to be waist-high workbenches attached to the walls and ceiling. He finds a gun on one of the benches. After finding the gun, he realizes the door he came through is gone; instead, there is an uneven, three-sided door he enters to find the unconscious woman on the other side.",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in a time when humans have interstellar travel and are mapping new galaxies. They are feared by at least some of the aliens they have encountered, such as Hatcher\u2019s people who were almost completely wiped out after their last human contact. The aliens are so fearful now that they have abandoned a planet as a decoy for the humans and are capturing humans off the Starship Jodrell Bank that they\u2019ve detected in their galaxy to probe them and find out ways to fight or escape humans for good.\nWhen McCray is captured, he awakes in a strange room with three walls made of a hard organic compound, and one wall made of grates that a pungent halogen smell came out of. There is a dim pink light in the room, and it is filled with meaningful objects from McCray\u2019s past and present that he thinks of like a creepy trophy room of his life. Importantly there is a modern spacesuit that saves his life when the aliens administer a survival test that heats the room and pumps in chlorine gas through the grates. Directly outside of this room is a sterile hallway and the rest of the testing facilities of the aliens. There are other rooms similar to his where other humans are being probed by the aliens, such as the woman he hears screaming through the radio of his space suit who is in a nearby room.\nHatcher, the alien in charge of conducting the Probe Team to make contact with the humans, observes them with his team of scientists and they take detailed notes on their actions that are reported to the supervisory council of probes in another nearby room.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in the spiral arm of the galaxy where the aliens who abduct McCray are living. McCray is abducted from the Starship Jodrell Bank where he is navigator as the ship is on a trip from Earth to the colonies in Betelgeuse Nine. McCray is on the ship one minute, and the next, he is in a completely dark room full of unidentifiable objects. Unknown to him, the objects have been selected by the aliens as ones that are on McCray\u2019s ship to give him a homey setting. McCray has been trying to feel the objects and his surroundings to determine where he is. When he calls out in frustration because he can\u2019t see, they light up a spacesuit that gives him enough illumination to see the objects that include a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old fashioned children\u2019s rocking chair, a chemistry set, and a girl\u2019s bathing suit. Three of the walls, the floor, and the room's ceiling are an unusual substance, possibly cellulose. The fourth wall is grated like a ventilation system, and there is a faint smell of halogen gases lingering in the room. The spacesuit has a radio which McCray uses to contact his ship, but it doesn\u2019t respond immediately. \n\tFrom another room, McCray is being observed by Hatcher and his probe team. Hatcher isn\u2019t exactly male; his race doesn\u2019t have them, but he isn\u2019t female either. He is a three-foot sphere-shaped glob of jelly covered with a hard shell. His arms and legs are not attached but rather are snakelike structures that obey his brain. They work best close to the body but can work up to a fourth of a mile from it. Hatcher\u2019s appendages are the calmest ones in the room.\n\tThe building where all this takes place is located underground. The supervising council is located in the same building, and Hatcher can move from his observation room to the council\u2019s room in a matter of minutes. Due to the lag in transmission time and message reception, McCray believes he is somewhere around five hundred light-years away from his ship.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Five Hells of Orion by Frederick Pohl takes place on an unknown planet light-years away from the realm of human discovery. The probes, a blob-like alien race, have captured two humans and brought them back to their home to study and observe them. Herrel McCray wakes up to a dark prison cell filled with Earthly items, such as a book or a bathing suit. This tiny cell has three impenetrable walls, and then the fourth is made of something similar to plastic. He cuts into the fourth wall with an ax and escapes the room only to arrive in a new one. This one features cupboards with the same impenetrable surfaces and an antique pistol that had been previously taken apart. As Herrel makes his way through the story, the reader sees very little of the compound they\u2019re keeping him in, as there is presumably not a lot of light. However, we do know the probes eat in an eating room that features a trough where they can dispose of their bodily fluids. "

Any progress?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; but\nwe thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.\"\n  \n \n  The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting.

        "Summary_1": "Hatcher is an alien of an unnamed race. He cannot be described as male because his race \"had no true males.\" He is three feet tall with a hard-shelled, circular body of jelly. His arms and legs are snakelike mandibles that can detach from his body, and he can control them with his brain from vast distances, although their effectiveness diminishes the further they travel from Hatcher's body. When they return to Hatcher's body, they rest in crevices in his skin. When he feeds, a slit appears at the bottom of his body and emits a thin, fetid fluid Hatcher throws away; he then places a nutrient-filled, kelp-like vegetable in the slit for sustenance. Hatcher is young, adventurous, scientifically gifted, knowledgeable, and enjoys playing sports. Although he does not feel the equivalent of human empathy, he also doesn't want harm to befall McCray and feels responsible for his proper care. Hatcher manages the probe team that observes McCray throughout the story, and he reports on McCray's behavior and his use of \"paranormal powers\" to the supervising council. Hatcher worries about hurrying to establish communication with McCray because he believes it will harm and perhaps even kill him, and later he wonders if communication is even possible at all with humans (later, he notes he is able to establish a minor level of communication with the female but wonders if others might be able to communicate with her). When Hatcher makes his report to the supervising council, they inform him of the return of the Old Ones, who have captured a member of The Central Masses Probe Team. He questions whether or not to tell his crew considering he was never explicitly told not to by the council. In many ways, Hatcher and McCray are similar although Hatcher is generally disgusted by the human body.",
        "Summary_2": "Hatcher is an alien from a race that was once nearly completely destroyed by humans (they call Old Ones) before. They are now probing humans from McCray\u2019s ship, Starship Jodrell Bank, because they have detected the human mapping mission in the spiral arm of their galaxy and are afraid of another encounter. They are looking for ways to fight or to escape humans for good, and have abandoned one of their planets as a precautionary decoy to avoid an encounter.\nHatcher runs one of the alien Probe Teams, and McCray is one of his human subjects. Hatcher is an adventurous, young scientist who enjoys games and sports, and he is in a position of importance - reporting only to a Councillor of the supervising council of all probes. Hatcher is a three foot diameter sphere with a hard shell and jelly interior. He possesses arms and legs but they are not attached to the sphere of his body. He controls those appendages with his brain telepathically, such that they can be operating in one room when he is in another. He doesn\u2019t want to harm his subjects, including McCray, because they are difficult to acquire. Hatcher doesn\u2019t necessarily have emotions, but he can comprehend human feelings and knows when McCray is in distress during the experiments. Hatcher\u2019s role is essential to his people making contact with humans and finding ways to deal with them so that they don\u2019t have to continue living through generations of fear about being wiped out by them. ",
        "Summary_3": "Hatcher leads the probe team observing Herrell McCray and testing him when he discovers that McCray has paranormal powers (which are actually his voice and the radio microphone). Once he realizes this, he immediately takes the news to the supervising council. After discussing the new information, the council orders Hatcher to establish communication with McCray immediately. They explain that the Central Masses team has just lost one of their probe team to the Old Ones, so the danger is even greater than before, and time is running out. Hatcher is reluctant to push McCray for fear of causing harm to him, but the council lets him know they are facing an emergency. Hatcher informs his team the council is ordering them to move to Stage Two. They increase the heat and pour a halogen gas into the room and watch as McCray uses the spacesuit for protection and breaks out of the room using the space-ax. This means that McCray has passed the first survival test. When the female subject cries out in pain, Hatcher watches with interest as McCray makes his way to her. He thinks that the female and McCray are communicating with each other. Hatcher\u2019s team adds a door to the room McCray is in so that he can find the female, and Hatcher is pleased that McCray has made it this far in their test.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Hatcher is one of the probes and the leader of his particular study group. He is a three-foot-tall blob with detachable limbs. He eats through a slit lower on his body, which processes vegetation and then essentially pees it out. He is fairly young, but also very intelligent and capable. Hatcher acts as the commander over the team of probes that are testing and observing Herrel McCray. He, of course, reports to the Council who oversee several different probe operations. Hatcher does not want to kill the Earthmen and believes they are moving too fast with their tests. "

Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets.

But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh.

        "Summary_1": "Physically speaking, the probes refer to the snakelike mandibles that form the arms and legs of the alien race to which Hatcher belongs. These mandibles are able to detach themselves and travel vast distances away from the body, conducting experiments and running errands controlled remotely by the brain. When they return to the body, they settle into little grooves formed in the skin at the base of the globular host body. Hatcher manages the probe team responsible for observing McCray and running him through a series of tests. The supervising council oversees operations of all the various Probe Teams throughout the universe; the ultimate goal of all Probe Teams is to discover a way in which to defend their race against the hostile Old Ones who have recently resurfaced and captured a team member from The Central Masses Probe Team.",
        "Summary_2": "The probes are significant because they are being conducted by an alien race in order to find a way to fight humans or to escape them. The threat of the humans (called Old Ones by the aliens) has loomed over the aliens for generations, and Hatcher describes that one encounter with them in the past had nearly completely destroyed their people. The only way they were able to escape was by abandoning one of their planets as a decoy and running away. When Hatcher\u2019s people once again detected that there were humans on a mapping mission in their spiral arm of the galaxy, they formed Probe Teams to capture and study the humans. The success of the probes in establishing contact with the humans is essential to them understanding how to protect their people from the fear they live under.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The probes are being carried out in an effort to find an ally among the Old Ones (humans) in order to save the beings of Orion. They had an encounter with the Old Ones years ago, and their race had almost been destroyed. They had to run and hide, take a populated planet with them, and then abandon it. Now the Old Ones are sending out mapping teams near their planet, and they are running out of time. The Probe Teams are trying to find a way to combat the Old Ones or else run from them again. Time is growing shorter because now the Central Masses have taken someone from one of their probe teams, so they might be getting the information to destroy them. ",
        "Summary_4": "The probes cause the main conflict in this story: the kidnapping and testing of two humans. The probes are worried that human domination will occur again and their species will be murdered or forced out of their homes. They plan to learn more about these humans, so they can destroy them, know their plans, or know when to run. The probes kidnap Herrel McCray from the Jodrell Bank and put him through a series of tests to better understand his race. Evidently, they have done this before, for Hatcher speaks of previous test subjects who all died during the first test. "

        "Article": " \n  THE FIVE HELLS OF ORION\n  \n \n  BY FREDERICK POHL\n  \n \n  Out in the great gas cloud of the Orion\n   \n  Nebula McCray found an ally\u2014and a foe!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  His name was Herrell McCray and he was scared.\n  \n \n  As best he could tell, he was in a sort of room no bigger than a prison\ncell. Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business\nin it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump\nfrom Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray\nwas ship's navigator, plotting course corrections\u2014not that there were\nany, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings\nwere made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth\nangles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon\nstars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the\nlocking mechanism visually. It was only a personal quaintness; he had\ndone it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel\nand Saiph ... it happened.\n  \n \n  The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a\ncollection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes\nand a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something\nthat rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered\nhollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled\ndangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right\nthrough his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched\nit.\n  \n \n  McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n  \n \n  Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No. Not\nquite utter silence.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something\nlike a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as\nstill as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n  \n \n  Probably it was only an illusion.\n  \n \n  But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n  \n \n  It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get\nfrom a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on\n   \n   Starship Jodrell Bank\n   \n  to\nthis damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to\nhurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in\nexasperation: \"If I could only\n   \n   see\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like\nbaker's dough, not at all resilient.\n  \n \n  A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He\nwas looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Among the debris on the floor, he remembered, was a five-foot space-ax,\ntungsten-steel blade and springy aluminum shaft.\n  \n \n  McCray caught it up and headed for the door. It felt good in his\ngauntlets, a rewarding weight; any weapon straightens the back of the\nman who holds it, and McCray was grateful for this one. With something\nconcrete to do he could postpone questioning. Never mind why he had\nbeen brought here; never mind how. Never mind what he would, or could,\ndo next; all those questions could recede into the background of his\nmind while he swung the ax and battered his way out of this poisoned\noven.\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Crash-clang!\n   \n  The double jolt ran up the shaft of the ax, through his\ngauntlets and into his arm; but he was making progress, he could see\nthe plastic\u2014or whatever it was\u2014of the door. It was chipping out. Not\neasily, very reluctantly; but flaking out in chips that left a white\npowdery residue.\n  \n \n  At this rate, he thought grimly, he would be an hour getting through\nit. Did he have an hour?\n  \n \n  But it did not take an hour. One blow was luckier than the rest; it\nmust have snapped the lock mechanism. The door shook and slid ajar.\nMcCray got the thin of the blade into the crack and pried it wide.\n  \n \n  He was in another room, maybe a hall, large and bare.\n  \n \n  McCray put the broad of his back against the broken door and pressed it\nas nearly closed as he could; it might not keep the gas and heat out,\nbut it would retard them.\n  \n \n  The room was again unlighted\u2014at least to McCray's eyes. There was not\neven that pink pseudo-light that had baffled him; here was nothing\nbut the beam of his suit lamp. What it showed was cryptic. There were\nevidences of use: shelves, boxy contraptions that might have been\ncupboards, crude level surfaces attached to the walls that might have\nbeen workbenches. Yet they were queerly contrived, for it was not\npossible to guess from them much about the creatures who used them.\nSome were near the floor, some at waist height, some even suspended\nfrom the ceiling itself. A man would need a ladder to work at these\nbenches and McCray, staring, thought briefly of many-armed blind giants\nor shapeless huge intelligent amoebae, and felt the skin prickle at the\nback of his neck.\n  \n \n  He tapped half-heartedly at one of the closed cupboards, and was not\nsurprised when it proved as refractory as the door. Undoubtedly he\ncould batter it open, but it was not likely that much would be left of\nits contents when he was through; and there was the question of time.\n  \n \n  But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches.\nMetallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a\nstiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar. They were, he\nthought, very much like the parts of a bullet-gun.\n  \n \n  In fact, they were. He could recognize barrel, chamber, trigger, even\na couple of cartridges, neatly opened and the grains of powder stacked\nbeside them. It was an older, clumsier model than the kind he had seen\nin survival locker, on the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  \u2014and abruptly wished he were\ncarrying now\u2014but it was a pistol. Another trophy, like the strange\nassortment in the other room? He could not guess. But the others had\nbeen more familiar; they all have come from his own ship. He was\nprepared to swear that nothing like this antique had been aboard.\n  \n \n  The drone began again in his ear, as it had at five-minute intervals\nall along:\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  calling Herrell McCray....\"\n  \n \n  And louder, blaring, then fading to normal volume as the AVC circuits\ntoned the signal down, another voice. A woman's voice, crying out in\npanic and fear: \"\n   \n   Jodrell Bank!\n   \n  Where are you? Help!\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  Hatcher's second in command said: \"He has got through the first\nsurvival test. In fact, he broke his way out! What next?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" Hatcher ordered sharply. He was watching the new specimen and\na troublesome thought had occurred to him. The new one was female and\nseemed to be in pain; but it was not the pain that disturbed Hatcher,\nit was something far more immediate to his interests.\n  \n \n  \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that they are in contact.\"\n  \n \n  His assistant vibrated startlement.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Hatcher said, \"but watch. Do you see? He is going straight\ntoward her.\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher, who was not human, did not possess truly human emotions; but\nhe did feel amazement when he was amazed, and fear when there was\ncause to be afraid. These specimens, obtained with so much difficulty,\nneeded so badly, were his responsibility. He knew the issues involved\nmuch better than any of his helpers. They could only be surprised at\nthe queer antics of the aliens with attached limbs and strange powers.\nHatcher knew that this was not a freak show, but a matter of life and\ndeath. He said, musing:\n  \n \n  \"This new one, I cannot communicate with her, but I get\u2014almost\u2014a\nwhisper, now and then. The first one, the male, nothing. But this\nfemale is perhaps not quite mute.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then shall we abandon him and work with her, forgetting the first one?\"\n  \n \n  Hatcher hesitated. \"No,\" he said at last. \"The male is responding well.\nRemember that when last this experiment was done every subject died; he\nis alive at least. But I am wondering. We can't quite communicate with\nthe female\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But?\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm not sure that others can't.\"\n  \n",

He is grateful when a pinkish light offers some illumination, and he attempts to contact his ship using the radio on a spacesuit he finds in the room. Before the light goes out, he panics when he is not able to see any part of his body; he later realizes this was a trick of the light.

He tries the radio on a spacesuit in the room several times. He receives a message from his ship several hours later that gives him a glimmer of hope for rescue, but he calculates that he must be five hundred light years away from them to account for the hours-long lag between messages. When the room begins heating up and chlorine gas begins burning his lungs as the aliens administer a survival test, he quickly gets into the spacesuit and breaks out of the room with a large space axe.

He tries to explore the objects with his hands but in frustration, calls out that he wishes he could see, and there is a flicker of pinkish light from a spacesuit. With the light available to him, he looks at the other objects in the room: a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old-fashioned child\u2019s rocking chair, a chemistry set\u2026.The objects are somewhat familiar, many of which he had owned himself. Three walls are solid, but the fourth seems to be a grating, perhaps a ventilator. McCray recalls that spacesuits have radios, so he tries to contact his ship but receives no answer. He thinks about the speed of radio transmissions and realizes he must be far away from his ship not to receive an immediate reply. \n\tUnknown to McCray, he has been selected for observation and an experiment by a probe team.

It dawns on him that the distance between him and his ship is so great that it takes two or three hours to transmit messages. After sending another message, he uses the space-ax to break through the door of the room because the gas is hurting his lungs. He finds himself in another room or hallway with what appear to be workbenches mounted at various heights. On one he sees the parts of a bullet-gun.\n\tNext, McCray hears a woman calling for help. He tries to determine the direction of her voice, and when he turns around, there is an open door where there wasn\u2019t one earlier.

After stumbling around in the dark, a faint pink glow partially illuminates his surroundings. He sees a bunch of random items, like books, a bathing suit, and a rocking chair. There\u2019s also a spacesuit, which he uses to attempt to communicate with his ship by accessing the microphone. No one responds to his cries though, and he notices that he is unable to see his hands in the reflection of the spacesuit. He screams and darkness falls again. Later, remembering another aspect of the handy-dandy spacesuit, Herrel flicks on the light inside of it and is now able to see the entire room. He is also able to see his own body again, which calms him down. He feels the temperature increase, smells a weird, halogenic-like scent, and hears a buzzing, but he ignores it as his spacesuit starts speaking. Someone aboard the Jodrell Bank is calling for him, so he responds, but there\u2019s no answer. He realizes that he must be hundreds of light-years away for communication to be taking this long. Realizing there\u2019s poison in the air, he steps inside the spacesuit to avoid suffocation. The suit cooled him and provided fresh air. He picks up an ax off the floor and uses it to chop down the door. He escapes his cell and explores the next room. Jodrell Bank calls in again, but this time a woman answers it, also calling for help. He tracked her voice and went through a previously-unopened door to find her.

        "Summary_1": "A Gleeb for Earth is a collection of letters, signed by two characters - Ivan Smernda (a human on Earth who owns the Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City) and Glmpauszn (an alien from a world that is entwined with Earth through a spiritual fringe). \nIvan dictates the first letter through his son Ronnie (14 years old) and sends it to the Editor of a print publication, feeling responsible for publicizing what he witnessed to save humanity. Ivan recounts an occurrence in the Plaza Ritz Arms where two alcoholic guests that he calls \u201cstew bums\u201d, Joe Binkle and Ed Smith (an alias for Glmpauszn), mysteriously disappeared, leaving their suits behind as if they had melted out of them. Ed had checked in with a mirror with a heavy bronze frame. After their disappearance, Ivan found only their clothes, the frame of the mirror in Ed\u2019s room, and a stack of letters in the bureau in Joe\u2019s room, which are the letters that tell the remaining story.\nThe vibrational plane of an alien world extends into Earth\u2019s (which they call the not-world), allowing intrusive vibrations from Earth to semi-terrorize sentient alien vibrations. Human spiritual mediums can force psychic reproductions of themselves into the alien world, and conversely pull alien vibrations over the \u201cfringe\u201d. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate it, and send Glmpauszn and Joe to take on human form and develop a chemical weapon to kill all humans.\nGlmpauszn crosses the fringe through a vibrational gateway that allows his consciousness to move into a newborn baby. Joe has already arrived in human form. Glmpauszn quickly grows the baby into an adult man. At three days old, he is 36 inches tall and talking, and a couple of days later is an adult man. Glmpauszn writes to Joe by controlling the minds of sleeping people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. He wonders why Joe won\u2019t write to him, and can\u2019t contact him spiritually, like normal, since Joe has fallen into alcoholism. Glmpauszn forgets to wear clothes and is nearly arrested, but escapes by becoming invisible. When Joe finally writes, it is to ask for money, enraging Glmpauszn who reports Joe\u2019s actions to their boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn becomes distracted by exploring human emotions like intimacy with women and love of money, which causes him to rob a bank and fill 18 rooms of a hotel with money. He also falls into alcoholism. Blgftury is accidentally summoned into a seance by a human medium who pulls Blgftury\u2019s vibrations through the fringe (the very thing they are trying to stop from happening), and Glmpauszn is caught with a red-haired woman by his boss not doing his job. Glmpauszn finally develops a mold that can kill humans, and meets with Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms with lots of gin that they consume before successfully returning to the vibrational frequency of their world, releasing the mold in the room.\n",
        "Summary_2": "\n\tThe story begins with a letter to the editor of a magazine describing two unusual incidents in a hotel in New York. In both cases, two men checked into the hotel and then mysteriously disappeared, leaving all of their belongings behind, including the clothes they were wearing. The man who owns the hotel doesn\u2019t want to involve the police for fear of reprisals against him; therefore, he sends the letters to the magazine, hoping they will print them. \n\tThe rest of the story is a series of letters, all addressed to Joe Binkle but written in different handwritings and from other parts of the US and the world. They trace the progress of a being named Glmpauszn who, in the first letter, is preparing to be born so that he can enter human society. Once he is born, he grows quickly, and within days, he escapes the hospital and hides in a cave until he has grown into a man. At that point, he makes his way to a chemist to procure the chemicals he needs for his mission: to destroy humanity for encroaching on his world. He walks down the street trying to act normal, but a young lady sees him and begins screaming: he has forgotten to wear clothes. Glmpauszn blames part of his failure on Joe, who apparently is supposed to provide him with the background information he needs to succeed.\n\tGlmpauszn often comments that he has yet to receive a return letter from Joe, but when he does, he complains that Joe has asked him for a $5.00 loan. Glmpauszn refuses the loan initially, making much of the fact that Joe didn\u2019t greet him or express pleasure at his arrival. Glmpauszn alludes to the fact that humans have encroached on their world through the use of mediums or spiritualists. \n\tGlmpauszn takes time to experience various aspects of humanity, including emotions and impressions, such as love of money, love, beauty, pain, etc. He thinks he is on the verge of love until he suggests a biological exploration of it and the women say yes, leading him to conclude it isn\u2019t love. In the meantime, Glmpauszn drinks more and more and accidentally sets off an explosion in his hotel rooms. \n\tGlmpauszn keeps Joe up to date on what he is doing but complains about Blgrtury\u2019s criticism and demands for reports. Finally, Glmpauszn tells Joe that he has successfully created a mold that will destroy humans by dissolving their brains and then their bodies. He also tells Joe to meet him at his original place of birth, and he will bring the gateway, a large mirror. The plan is to drink all the gin they have and then plant the mold in the hotel.\n\tThe hotel owner has read all the letters and wants to know if anyone can tell him how long a gleeb is, as several times in his letters, Glmpauszn refers to this length of time.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with a hotel owner, Ivan Smernda, writing to the editor of a magazine about two strange guests at his hotel. Ivan has found only their suits, some letters, and the frame of a mirror left over after their stay. Ivan has forwarded these letters he has found to the editors of the magazine. These letters tell a story of two alien visitors to Ivan's world that intend to destroy all of humanity because the vibrations from Ivan's world sometimes cross over into their world. The alien visitors become addicted to alcohol and human feelings, but ultimately they succeed in developing a mold that will spread across humanity and kill everyone.",
        "Summary_4": "This epistolary narrative begins with a letter to the editor of a paranormal-themed magazine. The letter's author, Ivan Smernda, owns a hotel called Plaza Ritz Arms, and recently two of his guests mysteriously vanished leaving behind several letters, a mirror frame without the mirror, and each of their suit of clothes, perfectly intact. The men are named Ed Smith and Joe Binkle, although Ivan guesses these are aliases. Ivan shares the men's letters with the editor in the hopes that they will be printed and serve as a warning for humanity. The first letter reveals Ed Smith's true name, which is Glmpauszn. Glmpauszn and Joe are Frequencies, ghost-like entities that exist in a spirit dimension adjacent to human reality. Due to the rise of humans using the services of mediums and fortune tellers to make contact with loved ones in the spirit world, the Frequencies feel terrorized. Glmpauszn has been sent to inhabit the human dimension, what he calls the \"not-world\", in order to find a way to destroy humanity and end its assault upon the vibrations of the Frequencies. Joe has already spent several \"gleebs\" (an unspecified amount of time) on Earth studying human ways in order to prepare Glmpauszn for his mission. They write to each other by possessing the minds and bodies of sleeping humans who can translate the language and write the letters. Glmpauszn details how he attuned himself to a human fetus and then sped up the growing process upon his birth, believing that the speed of his growth would impress his not-mother and not-father. Instead, he only frightens them both, and he runs away to a cave whereupon he accelerates his growth until he becomes an adult. As he begins to seek out a chemist to help him begin to plan the destruction of humanity, he runs into a woman who screams when she sees he is totally naked. Embarrassed, Glmpauszn lashes out at Joe, complaining that he has not prepared him sufficiently for his mission, and he must better learn human customs and emotions. He slowly adapts the forms and impressions of the human dimension. Not only does he love drinking hard liquor, but he also uses his invisibility power to rob a bank and fill his eighteen-room suite at the hotel with money. As Glmpauszn grows increasingly enamored with the human experience, he begins to neglect his mission, including reporting to his boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn drinks excessively and starts to court women, seeking out the elusive feeling of love. One night he even attends a seance, and the medium summons Blgftury, who glares at him in anger. As Glmpauszn falls deeper into alcoholism, his neglect of the mission becomes so bad that he accidentally blows up his suite of rooms at the hotel. Eventually, he devises a kind of mold that can cause a fatal disease to spread throughout the planet. Mission accomplished, Glmpauszn suggests he and Joe rendezvous at Joe's hotel and return to their home dimension through the mirror gateway."

        "Summary_1": "A Gleeb for Earth takes place on Earth, where the spiritual vibrations of human mediums and psychics are intruding upon and semi-terrorizing another world populated by sentient vibrational beings. The vibrational plane of the alien world extends just a tiny bit into Earth (referred to as the not-world by the aliens), and the fringe between the two allows for human psychics to intrude into the alien\u2019s realm, or for human seance practises to summon alien vibrations on Earth in ways that are terrifying for the aliens. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate these vibrational intrusions any longer and have embarked on a mission to destroy all life on Earth by having two of their own take the form of humans and develop a chemical weapon (a mold) to wipe them out.\nThe mission of Glmpauszn and Joe takes place on Earth between June 8th and September 25th of an unknown year. Glmpauszn mails letters from various international locations to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City by controlling the minds of unknown sleeping humans to pen what he spiritually dictates, and mail the letters without ever knowing they have done it. Glmpauszn\u2019s physical location is not explicitly discussed, but it is possibly nearby to New York City since he does not mention the need for any long-distance or international travel in his letters. Both Glmpauszn and Joe become distracted from their mission at times by drugs, alcohol, stealing money using their invisibility, and the sensations of experiencing human emotions like love.\nThe Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City is an especially important location in the story, because it is the final meeting place where Glmpauszn and Joe return to their vibrational realm through a mirror with a heavy bronze frame, leaving their clothes in heaps as if they had melted out of them, only the frame of the mirror, and the pile of letters from Glmpauszn to Joe that detail their entire mission on Earth.\n",

Glmpauszn has been tasked with ending the human race so that they can no longer pull beings from their homeworld anymore and cause them great pain. Glmpauszn needs to travel to do this, and taking the form of a person on Earth means he can move freely, despite the fact that there is quite a learning curve in becoming disguised as a human.",
        "Summary_4": "Thanks to an increase in the number of humans using the services of mediums, fortune tellers, and s\u00e9ances, there has been substantial interference in the vibrational plane that connects the human dimension with the real of the Frequencies. The humans see this as a meaningful way to interact with deceased loved ones, while the Frequencies view this as an invasive practice that terrorizes their way of life. Glmpauszn has been sent from the Frequency realm to the human dimension in order to find a way to destroy humanity and restore peace to their society. By attuning himself to a human fetus, Glmpauszn believes he will be able to better disguise himself and avoid detection. He experiences growing pains as he works to assimilate to human customs and emotions. He struggles with alcoholism and begins dating women in order to find love. Glmpauszn grows to enjoy being human, but it also distracts him from his ultimate mission."

        "Summary_1": "Glmpauszn is a sentient being from an alien world that takes the form of spiritual vibrations that are capable of controlling humans on Earth (which he refers to as the non-world), or entering the body of a human to take their form. He travels through a gateway (a vibrational point that alters the frequency of those who enter in the form of a mirror with a heavy bronze frame), allowing Glmpauszn to take on the frequency of a human and move his consciousness into a newborn baby. Once on Earth in newborn form, Glmpauszn quickly grows the body of the newborn baby into that of an adult man over a matter of days, and begins using the alias Ed Smith. He writes to Joe by vibrationaly controlling the minds of a variety of literate people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. The people he uses the mind of never become aware that they have written or mailed the letters.\nJoe (an alias name) is of the same world as Glmpauszn, and they are on a mission together to destroy all human life on Earth in order to stop the intrusive vibrations of Earth polluting their spiritually sentient world. There is a rocky start to their mission as Glmpauszn is not receiving any contact back from Joe who has become distracted by drugs and alcohol in his human form on Earth. Normally, Glmpauszn would be able to reach Joe through spiritual vibrations instead of letters, but Joe\u2019s vibrations are very weak due to the substances he takes. Joe eventually does write to Glmpauszn, but only to ask for money, which greatly offends Glmpauszn who becomes furious with him for abandoning their mission. However, their relationship changes as Glmpauszn begins to experiment with the feelings of being human, and tries to feel love and consume alcohol. Glmpauszn starts to relate to Joe\u2019s experience with alcohol, and they even decide to bring lots of gin to consume when they finally meet at the Plaza Ritz Arms to re-enter the gateway to their own world together after releasing the deadly mold that will kill all humans on Earth and complete their mission. They finish the mission triumphantly together, with Glmpauszn referring to them together in one of his final letters as conquerors and liberators for their world.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The relationship between Glmpauszn and Joe is much like that of brothers. Joe is like an older brother who gives Glmpauszn advice, but when Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t like what Joe writes in his letters, he makes sure to send them on to Blgftury to \u201ctell on him.\u201d Glmpauszn relies on Joe\u2019s information, based on his experience in the human world. In his first letter to Joe, though, Glmpauszn blames him for not responding to his vibrations, forcing Glmpauszn to communicate with Joe by mail. By his second letter, however, Glmpauszn is more sympathetic to complications that Joe must have encountered due to humans, although he still doesn\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t received letters in response to his own. \n       Interestingly, Glmpauszn tells Joe all about what he is doing but is less forthcoming with Blgftury. Yet Glmpauszn blames Joe for being inefficient in providing the information he needs to succeed in his mission. Interestingly, at one point, Glmpauszn complains that Joe has asked for a loan of $5.00, which Glmpauszn refuses until later. Glmpauszn confesses that he is trying to learn to love money as humans do and has been amassing large amounts of it; he agrees to loan Joe the $5.00 he requested earlier but only by sending it through the person writing the letter for him.\n\tLike a big brother, Joe gives Glmpauszn advice. He specifically advises him not to drink alcohol. By the time Glmpauszn receives this letter, he is already heavily imbibing and learning the impact of hangovers. Glmpauszn confesses that he needs the alcohol to escape from the reality of human life. He also acknowledges that it is dulling his abilities, including the ability to become invisible. For their final encounter, which will be when Glmpauszn launches his attack on humanity, he wants Joe to bring as much gin as he can, and he will do the same. Together, after all the gin is gone, Glmpauszn and Joe will return to their world through the gateway of the mirror.\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Glmpauszn writes Joe as a companion on this quest to destroy humanity, but his written communications only go one way as far as the reader can tell. Joe never writes back, but can communicate with Glmpauszn via psychic ability, or \"vibrations.\" Glmpauszn quickly sours on Joe as he realizes that Joe has lost most of his alien abilities due to being addicted to alcohol and obsessed with money. However, Glmpauszn comes around on his fellow alien as he falls victim to alcoholism and \"money-love\" himself.",
        "Summary_4": "Glmpauszn and Joe are both Frequencies who have attuned themselves to different humans in order to disguise themselves and gather information that will assist them in a plot to destroy humanity. Joe has spent a significant amount of time longer on Earth than Glmpauszn, and therefore he has had more time to adapt to human customs and emotions. Joe lives in New York at Plaza Ritz Arms, a hotel where the two eventually rendezvous in order to return to their home dimension when they accomplish their mission.  Glmpauszn sends Joe a number of letters describing his slow adjustment to human form. Although Joe's communications are never explicitly shared, his replies to Glmpauszn are minimal and often unrelated  to the letter to which he's responding. For example, Joe asks Glmpauszn for five dollars in response to a letter about Glmpauszn's rocky entry into the human dimension. This anger Glmpauszn, and he is further incensed when he receives a nonsensical, insulting communication later. However, after Glmpauszn discovers alcohol, he begins to relate to Joe, who has also succumbed to the struggles of alcoholism. Eventually, Glmpauszn develops a mold that can eliminate humanity, and they rendezvous at Joe's hotel to make their re-entrance to the vibrational plane via the mirror gateway."

        "Summary_1": "Blgftury is an alien of the same world as Glmpauszn and Joe, which is being semi-terrorized by intrusive vibrations from Earth (which they refer to as non-world) that pollute their world\u2019s sentient frequency. Their world wishes to destroy all human life on Earth to become free from these intrusions. Blgftury is the boss of the other two, and Glmpauszn often refers to having to write reports for him begrudgingly to update on the status of the mission.\nBlgftury is not a supportive boss, because he wished to go on this mission himself. Glmpauszn describes that Blgftury gave him little praise, and even wrote thinly-veiled threats, in his response to Glmpauszn\u2019s report on how he escaped the pursuit of the police when he was caught naked in public after forgetting humans need to put on clothes. Blgftury has the authority to take corrective action related to the mission, evidenced by how Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t hesitate to forward him the letters from Joe that he finds offensive about asking for money and discussing \u201crevolting bodily processes.\u201d \nBlgftury has to pester Glmpauszn for reports when he begins to go off the plan and experiment with human feelings like falling in love and alcohol. Glmpauszn does finally successfully develop a mold that will kill all humans on Earth and sends detailed chemistry reports back to Blgftury on the subject. \nBlgftury spends a lot of time sending vibrations in the fringe area between Earth and their world, and by accident his vibrations are summoned by a spiritual medium into a white, shapeless cascade of light at a human seance gathering that Glmpauszn happens to be attending on Earth where he is fooling around with a red-headed woman in the corner of the room (flagrantly not doing the work of the mission) in full visibility to Blgftury. Blgftury responded with a pattern in his matrix that showed pain, anger, fear and amazement. Glmpauszn goes on to complete the mission and return with Joe to their home world without further interaction with Blgftury.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Blgftury is the being who supervises Glmpauszn and whom Glmpauszn seems to dislike and want to impress at the same time. Glmpauszn thinks that Blgftury\u2019s criticism and threats are actually praise; he also thinks that Blgftury wanted to be the one to go on the expedition that Glmpauszn is on and is jealous that he didn\u2019t get to. At the same time, Glmpauszn wants to impress Blgftury. And when Glmpauszn has a complaint against Joe, he forwards it to Blgftury so that he is aware of what Joe is doing, most likely to make himself look better. Glmpauszn grows annoyed with Blgftury\u2019s requests for reports because he thinks he has other, more important things to do, such as exploring human emotions. To pacify Blgftury, Glmpauszn sends him reports about his experiments with chemistry that he plans to use to defeat humans, although he has not actually carried out these experiments. Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t have much respect for Blgftury and envisions an incident where Blgftury is present as an olive and is eaten by the blonde girl. \nAt a seance that Glmpauszn attends, the medium actually brings Blgftury across when she is trying to bring over a woman\u2019s grandmother. Blgftury looks angry and sees Glmpauszn, peering at him with an expression of pain, anger, fear, and amazement. At the end of the story, Glmpauszn has succeeded in his mission of creating a way to destroy the human race in the form of a mold. This mold will dissolve the brain and then cause the body to fall apart. Glmpauszn is pleased to have succeeded, and he dares Blgftury to make any criticism against what he has accomplished. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Blgftury is the alien in charge of this operation to destroy the \"not-world,\" which the reader would know better as Earth. Blgftury is concerned with the success of this mission and constantly badgers Glmpauszn for status reports. Blgftury appears briefly on Earth during a human seance, and this causes him great pain. Glmpauszn becomes quite annoyed with Blgftury, describing Blgftury's attempts to get updates about the mission as an annoyance. This is likely due to Glmpauszn becoming an alcoholic and being more interested in learning about human emotions like love instead of the mission at hand. ",
        "Summary_4": "Blgftury is a fellow Frequency to whom Glmpauszn is supposed to send consistent status updates on his mission to develop a way to destroy humanity. Blgftury had wanted to complete the mission himself, and he is rarely complimentary, so his communications with Glmpauszn are often curt. At first, Glmpauszn warns Joe he has forwarded his inappropriate, insulting letters to Blgftury. As time goes on, however, Glmpauszn reveals a growing distaste and impatience for Blgftury's grumpiness, criticisms, and bureaucratic oversight. At one point, he even expresses a desire for Blgftury to enter the human dimension in the vibrational pattern of an olive so that his blonde date could eat him. When Glmpauszn attends a s\u00e9ance conducted by Mrs. Somebody, he is horrified to see an angry Blgftury summoned instead of Grandma Lucy. "

I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\nall those mysteries. I met you when the whole\nvalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\nby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,\nnot me. He was the hero without even meaning to\nbe. He was the one who rode through town and\nwarned people that the flood was coming. I was off\nchasing a shadow.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n\u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\nto talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\ncould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\nabout?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n  \n \n  \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\n  \n \n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n  \n \n  \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\ntear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> id=\"chap02\">\n  CHAPTER II\n  \n If Wishes Came True\n  \n  \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Listen, lady,\" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, \"we got a long\nway to go to get home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said another kid, in a black mask, \"and we're late as it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't care less,\" Judy told them callously. \"You can't go down\nthat street.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete\nand elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt\nand a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a\nblack knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. \"Why can't we go down\nthere?\" this apparition demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Because I said so,\" Judy told him. \"Now, you kids get away from here.\nTake off.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. \"Hey, they're\nfighting down there!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a rumble,\" said Judy proudly. \"You twerps don't want to be\ninvolved.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went\nrunning around Judy and dashing off down the street.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Eddie!\" shouted one of the other kids. \"Eddie, come back!\"\n  \n \n  Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase\nthe one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would\ncome running along after her. She didn't know what to do.\n  \n \n  A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.\n\"Cheez,\" said one of the kids. \"The cops!\"\n  \n \n  \"Fuzz!\" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the\nschoolyard, shouting, \"Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!\"\n  \n \n  But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the\nschoolyard.\n  \n \n  The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving\ntheir arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling\noff their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering.\nThey were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's\nwarning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both\nschoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy\nand the rumble was over.\n  \n \n \n \n  Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great\nbig blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in\nthe yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.\n  \n \n  And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Lois and Lorraine are having lunch at Judy\u2019s house, speaking about how Judy nearly spoiled their double-wedding where they both became sisters under the name Farringdon-Petts by solving a mystery.  \nJudy starts telling the story of the haunted fountain. She discovered a photo of a spectacular fountain in her grandmother\u2019s hot attic one summer as she was stuck there for two weeks while her parents went on vacation. She shed a tear onto the photo while recalling her sadness about not having friends or a sister, and imagined the fountain was a place for lonely girls to fill with their tears. Her grandmother overhears her speaking aloud her wishes and calls that she shouldn\u2019t keep her wishes to herself, because \u201cmost of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\nJudy\u2019s grandparents take her to the fountain in the photo and it speaks to Judy, directing her to shed a tear into it and make wishes. Judy sheds a tear thinking about how her only friend just moved out of town and then hurries through her wishes before the ripples disappear - to have lots of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. All things that have come true in her life.\nAbruptly returning to Judy\u2019s modern timeline, she takes Lois and Lorraine to the attic. They are spooked by Judy\u2019s black cat, Blackberry, who makes sudden noises. Judy finds the photo and Lorraine recognizes the fountain is identical to one on her estate - yet it is in a different location. They surmise that it is in the woods on the edge of town that are part of the Brandt estate, and drive to it immediately.\nDuring their adventure, Judy recalls more of her fountain memory. Her grandparents didn\u2019t know the Brandt\u2019s well enough to pay them a visit, but instead stopped by the fountain on their way to drop off her grandmother\u2019s hooked rugs at the estate further up the path. Judy was left behind napping in a hammock - told by her grandparents they were getting her a surprise, but they didn\u2019t return. She followed a path to an old windowless tower, but got distracted by the sound of her grandfather's cart leaving. This is all she recalls, but there is evidently more to discover that will solve the mystery.\nThe trip to the fountain shakes the confidence of Lorraine in the back seat, who knows information about the new owners of the estate - Roger Banning - that she is withholding. Lois and Judy probe her about what she knows and why she ducked down to hide her face from a stranger passing in a car. Although Lorraine tells them about Roger, she does not reveal why she is afraid. Judy mentions knowing Roger\u2019s pal Dick Hartwell, who is apparently in the Federal Penitentiary for forgery now. As they park and exit the car to walk to the fountain, two dark-coated strangers approach them. This is where the story ends.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Judy, a woman known for solving mysteries and chasing ghosts, had her friends Lois and Lorraine over for lunch in the haunted house she had inherited from her family. When Judy was growing up, her parents would spend summers on vacation without her, so she did a lot of reading at her Grandmother Smeed's house. These were sad summers for her, but she would soon start to solve mysteries and find her own adventures. She mentioned her tears falling on a magazine with a picture of a fountain; she imagined it was full of tears of many girls and pondered the idea of an enchanted fountain. Her grandparents took her to see a fountain the next day, where she heard a voice that told her to make a wish and to cry into the fountain--the same fountain that was in the picture in the magazine. Judy's friends got more excited about the story, and it continued: she had to think of a wise wish, but reacted too quickly to think carefully. Her wishes did come true; she wanted lots of friends, a sister, to solve mysteries, and to marry a G-man. All of these things came true, and the fountain kept Judy captivated. She patiently explained to her friends that she hadn't tried to learn the secret of the fountain, and it didn't speak to her after the initial encounter. Judy had lost her appetite for her dessert but wanted to retrieve the photo of the fountain to see if Lois recognized it; they all went to the attic, bringing Blackberry the cat with them. Lorraine recognized the photo of the fountain, but it seemed to make her nervous. Lois didn't want to leave yet even though Lorraine was clearly uncomfortable and wanted to go, and thought she might recognize the fountain from the Brandt estate, so Lois and Judy decide it's worth checking out to see if it's the same one. Lorraine only agreed to join after they promised not to drive all the way up to the house, and to walk the last part of the way. After a twenty-minute drive, Judy talked more about what she remembered about the day she visited the garden; she'd fallen asleep in a hammock, and woke up to an empty garden. She headed towards a tower but found her grandfather's car before she encountered anyone. Through all of this, Lorraine hints that she knows more than she's letting on, and doesn't think things will be as Judy expected. This is when Judy picks up on Lorraine's reticence. Judy and Lois want to explore the old tower and look for the fountain, when Lois admits she knows Roger Banning has been around the area. Lucy and Lois push Lorraine to say more about why she isn't talking, and they want to know why she doesn't want to be recognized. The story ends in suspense as two people in dark coats are walking towards the three women.",
        "Summary_3": "Judy has invited her friends, Lois and Lorraine (who are sisters-in-law), to lunch at her home. She and her husband, Peter, live in a house she inherited from her grandmother. While Judy is out of the room, Lois asks Lorraine to tell Judy about something that is upsetting Lorraine, but Lorraine accuses Lois of always siding with Judy. On top of that, she claims that Judy almost ruined their double wedding. Judy enters at the end of the conversation, admitting that she has problems, too, and hasn\u2019t been able to solve all the mysteries she has attempted. When Judy mentions a promise she made not to discuss the dam and that she should have told Arthur, Lorraine has a pained expression and asks them not to talk about him.\nLois changes the subject, praising Judy\u2019s mystery-solving and ghost tracking abilities that she then explains sensibly; she asks Judy to tell them a story about one of her mysteries. Judy tells them about the haunted fountain that she saw when she was fifteen years old and spending part of the summer with her grandparents while her parents were on vacation. In the attic to look at some of her grandmother\u2019s old magazines, Judy began feeling sorry for being left behind and started crying. Her tear fell onto a picture of a fountain, and she pretended it was filled with the tears of lonely girls. Aloud, she comments that would make the fountain enchanted and starts to say a wish when her grandmother interrupts to tell her that if she let people know her wishes, most of them wouldn\u2019t be impossible to fulfill.\nThe next day, Judy\u2019s grandparents took her to a fountain that looked just like the one in the magazine. Judy walked into it and heard a voice telling her that if she sheds a tear in the fountain and makes a wish, her wish will come true. But the voice admonishes her to wish wisely. So Judy thought about how lonely she had been since her best friend had moved away and wished for lots of friends and a sister, to marry a G-man, and to solve lots of mysteries, all of which have come true.   \nJudy shows her friends magazine with the fountain, and Lois realizes it looks like the fountain on the nearby Brandt estate. On a whim, the three women decide to drive there to look at it. Although Lorraine is less than enthusiastic about the venture, she goes along but insists they not drive all the way to the house. After they turn into the long drive, a car approaches with a memorable-looking man at the wheel. As they near the path to the fountain, Judy recalls that her grandfather started to drive off without her, and she assumed he was teasing her. Lorraine admits she knows the Brandts no longer own the estate and has seen a classmate, Roger Banning, nearby. Suddenly, two dark-coated figures approach them.\n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Judy is enjoying dessert with her two friends Lorraine and Lois as she recounts a tale from her childhood in which she came across a magical fountain that granted her all of her wishes. This fountain has given Judy her husband, friends, and renown as a paranormal mystery solver. As they are in the home in which she discovered a picture of the magical fountain, the three ladies decide to go into the attic to dig up that picture. Upon seeing the picture of the fountain, Lorraine and Lois seem to know its location. The three ladies head there but it seems that Lorraine is hiding some secret connection with the fountain, and there are people there that don't seem to want them around the fountain."

I was off\nchasing a shadow.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n\u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\nto talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\ncould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\nabout?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture.

        "Summary_1": "The story opens at Judy\u2019s house as she has Lois and Lorraine over for lunch. Judy\u2019s lives in her grandparents' old house that she modernized with her husband, Peter. The house has an attic that is up a narrow set of stairs with a door at the top. They have a black cat named Blackberry that spooks her friends because it is creepy when it makes unexpected noises in the attic.\nWhen Judy is recalling the story of the fountain, the narrative bounces back and forth into their present reality as Lois and Lorraine ask questions.\nIn Judy\u2019s recalled story, she is a young red-haired girl with no friends who spends two weeks in the summer with her grandparents at their home. They have a hot attic filled with keepsakes and old reading materials, most notably a picture of a fountain that Judy\u2019s grandmother later brings her to. The fountain was centered in a deep, circular pool, and had steps leading up to it that were bordered with smaller fountains of lions with water spurting out of the mouths. Judy thinks it could be a beautiful location at any time of the year, surrounded by lush vegetation like rhododendrons and evergreens. From the fountain there was a path leading to a windowless old tower that was populated by cupids and gnomes that peered out at Judy.\nBack in modern day, when Judy, Lois and Lorraine go looking for the fountain, the tower is still visible, and Lorraine describes it as something out of \u201cGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales.\u201d The friends visit it on a day where the trees are leafless in the woods, making the rhododendrons appear vibrantly green, under a gray sky. They do not actually reach the fountain in the story, but they do pass several posted signs for \u201cNO TRESPASSING\u201d along the wooded road.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The house that Judy lives in was inherited from her grandparents, and she now lives there with her husband Peter and their cat Blackberry. She has made some changes to the house, including in the staircases to the attic, but she has not yet gone through all of her grandmother's belongings so they take up a lot of the attic. Judy's friends consider the house haunted, but Judy insists that at least the attic is not. After the three leave the house to investigate where the fountain might be, they head into the woods where there is an uphill road leading to the Brandt estate. In this estate, there was an old water tower that was visible from the path the women were on, but the story ended before the women were able to confirm if the fountain was on this estate or not. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place around the early 20th century in a town called Farringdon in the USA as Judy\u2019s grandparents still drove a horse-led wagon, but Lois now drives a car, and Judy\u2019s husband is employed by the FBI. The story begins at Judy\u2019s house, which she inherited from her grandparents. While she is in the process of renovating the house, she still has her grandmother\u2019s things in the attic, including the magazine with the picture of the fountain. Lois alludes to the fact that Judy has tracked down the ghosts in the attic and cellar of the house. The attic is where Judy found the magazine with the picture of the fountain on it that she is telling her friends about. When Judy saw the picture, she had never seen a fountain in person, although there is a fountain at the nearby turreted Farringdon-Petts mansion. After Judy shows the picture of the fountain to Lois and Lorraine, the two women recognize it as the fountain on the Brandt estate.\n        The fountain is part of the setting in the flashback in the story. Judy remembers visiting the fountain during June; it was centered in a deep, circular pool with steps leading to the fountain. Smaller fountains in the shapes of lions were beside the steps, and water spurted from their mouths. After leaving the fountain, Judy found a hammock in a beautiful garden encircled by rose trellises. There were also rhododendrons and evergreens in the garden. After waking from her nap in the hammock, Judy saw an old windowless tower and a path leading to it. She followed the trail, and all along it were cupid and gnome figures that seemed to be looking out at her, tucked into surprising places. Just as she reached the tower, she heard her grandfather leaving with the wagon.  \n\tThe rest of the story occurs in the present\u2019s second setting, the Brandt estate. The drive off the main road is a narrow, gravel road uphill through the woods. An oncoming car driven by a swarthy man with hypnotic eyes startles them. Traveling on, they pass more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendron and can see the tower from the car. As Lois turns the car around, two figures in dark coats approach them.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Most of the story takes place in Judy's grandparents' house, which Judy currently owns and has modernized. The main focus of the first half of the story is on the house's attic, where Judy's grandmother's things are kept. The story also takes place in a car on the way to the Brandt estate, which is the location of the fountain. The characters wind up on the estate, but it is a private estate and there are people there who do not want them there. The story takes place in a time period that seems older, with a lot of pomp and propriety. "

This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> id=\"chap02\">\n  CHAPTER II\n  \n If Wishes Came True\n  \n  \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Listen, lady,\" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, \"we got a long\nway to go to get home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said another kid, in a black mask, \"and we're late as it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't care less,\" Judy told them callously. \"You can't go down\nthat street.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete\nand elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt\nand a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a\nblack knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. \"Why can't we go down\nthere?\" this apparition demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Because I said so,\" Judy told him. \"Now, you kids get away from here.\nTake off.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. \"Hey, they're\nfighting down there!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a rumble,\" said Judy proudly. \"You twerps don't want to be\ninvolved.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went\nrunning around Judy and dashing off down the street.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Eddie!\" shouted one of the other kids. \"Eddie, come back!\"\n  \n \n  Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase\nthe one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would\ncome running along after her. She didn't know what to do.\n  \n \n  A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.\n\"Cheez,\" said one of the kids. \"The cops!\"\n  \n \n  \"Fuzz!\" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the\nschoolyard, shouting, \"Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!\"\n  \n \n  But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the\nschoolyard.\n  \n \n  The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving\ntheir arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling\noff their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering.\nThey were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's\nwarning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both\nschoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy\nand the rumble was over.\n  \n \n \n \n  Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great\nbig blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in\nthe yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.\n  \n \n  And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Judy was a freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that spent two weeks every summer with her grandmother, Smeed, and grandfather while her parents went on vacation to a beach hotel they honeymooned at many years ago. Judy resented being left behind by her parents. However, during one summer with her grandparents, they took her to an enchanted fountain that Judy found a photo of in their attic. The fountain spoke to Judy and asked her to shed a tear into the fountain and make wishes. All of the things that Judy wished for in her life came true - to have a lot of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. \nIn the telling of the story, Judy is older, married, and has a sister Lois (by way of Judy\u2019s marriage to her brother), and another close friend like a sister, Lorraine (by way of her marrying into the same family as Lois - the Farringdon-Petts). Judy shows modesty by bringing up the mysteries she never solved when Lois and Lorraine shower her with compliments. Judy\u2019s grandparents have since passed, but she lives in their home and keeps their belongings in the attic, showing her connection with family. \nJudy (maiden name Bolten) is married to Peter Dobbs, an FBI agent, and she prefers to discuss facts instead of gossiping about hear-say with Lois and Lorraine. Judy is diligent in asking questions about Lorraine\u2019s behavior when she ducks down in the car to hide her face from a passing stranger, and probes her to tell the truth about knowing who the new owner of the Brandt estate is - Roger Banning. Her wit is sharp, and she comes across as determined and willing to take risks to solve her mysteries (like passing no trespassing signs in broad daylight after they have already been spotted by a stranger).\n",
        "Summary_2": "Judy is a woman known for her sharp detective abilities. She is married to Peter Dobbs, and took his last name when they married instead of keeping her maiden name, Bolton. She grew up rather lonely, not having many friends--the one friend she did have moved away. After she made a wish in an enchanted fountain, however, her life changed--she found friends, a sister, a dream husband, and a new ability to solve mysteries which brought her notoriety in the area. She is a very curious person who loves to read, which is why she was with the magazines in the attic at her grandmother's in the first place. She grew up interested in mystery books also, as evidenced by the books her father bought her, which likely led to her interest in solving mysteries of her own. ",
        "Summary_3": "Judy Dobbs, n\u00e9e Bolton, is friends with Lois and Lorraine and their friend and her sister-in-law Honey. She is married to Peter Dobbs, an employee of the FBI. Growing up an only child, Judy had only one best friend and was very lonely when her friend moved away. She also never got to go on family vacations; her parents would leave her with her grandparents while they went to the beach hotel where they had spent their honeymoon. Judy is a forthright, somewhat self-centered woman. She is very curious and has a habit of pursuing mysterious occurrences to discover what is behind them. When the voice in the fountain urged her to make wise wishes, Judy wished for just the things that have happened in her life, but Judy points out that her wishes didn\u2019t come true until she started thinking of others. She also believes that as she goes through her grandmother\u2019s belongings, she might be able to solve some of the mysteries about her grandparents\u2019 lives. Judy is also analytical; she notices Lorraine\u2019s tendency toward jealousy and Lorraine\u2019s reaction to mentions of Arthur and suspects that Lorraine might be jealous about him. She also notices Lorraine\u2019s reaction to the oncoming car, hiding herself behind Lois, and her reluctance to tell them what she knows about the Brandt estate and confronts her, asking for her reasons.",
        "Summary_4": "Judy is the main character of the story and she has become famous for solving paranormal mysteries. Judy's drive to see the fountain that brought her all her good fortune is what drives the story forward and gets the characters into trouble. Judy seems like a privileged character who is thankful for that privilege. She's highly inquisitive, never wanting to let a mystery go unsolved. She is a content character, but much of the story's beginning is dedicated to describing how she was before she became content as a lonely, depressed younger girl in need of friends."

There isn\u2019t\nanything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters\nnow. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\nloyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s\npart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\nwedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe\nshe\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.\nEveryone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no\nexception.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming\nin to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\nfor lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have\nproblems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t\nsolve.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one\nsingle spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll\nbelieve you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\nall those mysteries. I met you when the whole\nvalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\nby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,\nnot me. He was the hero without even meaning to\nbe. He was the one who rode through town and\nwarned people that the flood was coming. I was off\nchasing a shadow.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n\u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\nto talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\ncould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\nabout?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n  \n \n  \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\n  \n \n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n  \n \n  \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\ntear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> id=\"chap02\">\n  CHAPTER II\n  \n If Wishes Came True\n  \n  \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> id=\"chap03\">\n  CHAPTER III\n  \n A Strange Encounter\n  \n  Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\ntrip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\nit under one condition. They were not to drive all\nthe way to the house which, she said, was just over\nthe hilltop. They were to park the car where no\none would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.\nShe and Lois both argued that it would be better to\ninquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\n  \n \n  \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it\nlooks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they\nstarted off in the blue car she was driving.\n  \n \n  It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\neasy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\nand said if they did find the fountain she thought\nshe\u2019d wish for one exactly like it.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said\nabout wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you\nlet people know about them instead of muttering\nthem to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know\nabout this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\nbe Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\ncoat he gave me last year.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too\nwarm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\ntrip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\nas it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\nhad covered the distance that had seemed such a\nlong way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s\nwagon.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve\njust about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t\nthink my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\nto pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\nqueer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s\nold farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\n  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t\nexplain what happened afterwards. When I woke\nup in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\nwagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to\nsee how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Again she broke off as if there were something\nshe wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare.\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy.\n  \n \n  \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\nwere telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\nbut you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d\nLorraine reminded her.\n  \n \n  \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,\nbut it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember\ndriving home along this road. You see, I thought my\ngrandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\nand would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\nThere wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next\nhill,\u201d Lois put in.\n  \n \n  \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I\ncouldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\ntower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\nI followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in\nthe woods that always tempts me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\nyour latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where\nthe hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d\nJudy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes\npeered out at me from unexpected places. I was\nactually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\nThere wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard\nthe rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he\nwas driving off without me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,\nand Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like\nthat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\nand wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.\n\u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\nthem, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for\nMrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they\nturned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\n  \n \n  \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s\nanother car coming.\u201d\n  \n \n  As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\nducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind\nJudy until the car had passed. The man driving\nit was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember\nhis hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a\nlong time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered\nmost of his hair.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois\nwhen the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for\nplaying hide and seek?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine\nbegged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there\nany more.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,\ncan\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly.\n  \n \n  She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew\nmore about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\n  \n \n  Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly\nroad. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge\nof rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very\ngreen next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.\nThe sky was gray with white clouds being driven\nacross it by the wind.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can\nsee it over to the left. It looks like something out of\nGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder\nwhat it is.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It\nwould be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut\nif there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give\nus permission.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy\nsuggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends\nas Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the\nroad. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to\nexplore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for\nthe fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf\nyou know anything about the people who live here\nnow, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,\nI\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do\nknow who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember\nRoger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?\nI\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have\nacquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on\nthe estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you\ntell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places\ntogether.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.\n\u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a\ncar of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger\nBanning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better\nthan that. I did know him slightly, but not from\nschool. The boys and girls were separated and went\nto different high schools by the time we moved to\n  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\nlot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at\nchurch.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer\nmention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy.\n  \n \n  Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts\nto gossip.\n  \n \n  \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from\nhis father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\nbusiness people. I think he forged some legal\ndocuments, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\nIt was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her.\n  \n \n  Now Judy did remember. It was something she\nwould have preferred to forget. She liked to think\nshe was a good judge of character, and she had taken\nDick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would\nnever stoop to crime.\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d\nLois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look\nfor it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I\njust like to know what a tiger looks like before he\nsprings at me,\u201d Judy explained.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition\nof ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine.\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who\nseems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.\n  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve\nseen that character who drove down this road and,\nfor some reason, you were afraid he would see you.\nWhy, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied\nevasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private\nestates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,\n\u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect\nwe\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused\nof trespassing.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two\ndark-coated figures strode down the road toward\nthem. \u201cYou drove right by a\n  NO TRESPASSING\n  sign,\nand this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to\nmeet us!\u201d\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Tears are the inciting event that connect Judy with the photo of the fountain as a tear rolls off her cheek and onto the photo as she thinks of her loneliness in her grandparents attic. Expressing her longing for friendship and a sister aloud sparks her grandmother to take her along to the fountain itself. When visiting the fountain, tears again become important because the fountain asks for a tear to be shed into it before wishes can be made.\nThe physical description of tears rolling onto a photograph or causing small ripples in the fountain that travel and dissipate are important visualizations that draw the reader into Judy\u2019s story, and make her character feel real. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Tears are first brought up when Judy is thinking about her summers that she spent in the attic at her grandmother's house, where she said she was reading but really needed some space to herself to cry. Her tears fell on a magazine that had a picture of a fountain, and she found it amusing that the fountain had tears as its source of water. She pretended that it was full of tears of many young girls, and her grandmother overheard her pondering this possible enchanted fountain, so they went to see a similar fountain the next day.  She cried into the fountain and her dreams eventually came true, changing the course of her life in many ways. ",
        "Summary_3": "Judy\u2019s tears over her loneliness of losing her best friend and not going on vacation with her parents provide the catalyst for significant changes in her life. When her tears fall on the picture of the fountain, and her grandmother overhears her comment about the enchanted fountain and her wishes, it marks the beginning of life-changing events. Her grandparents take her to see the fountain on the Brandt estate, and there, she hears the voice telling her if she sheds a tear in the fountain, her wishes will come true. As she watches the ripples in the water caused by her tear, Judy quickly comes up with several wishes that ultimately come true; even the wish for a sister that seemingly would be impossible to fill comes true when she gains a sister-in-law. Her story about the fountain and her tears are the impetus for Lois\u2019s push to visit the Brandt estate to see the fountain and for the women being caught trespassing on the property.",
        "Summary_4": "Judy spills tears while she is first looking at the photograph of the fountain in a magazine. Judy is crying because her parents have left her with her grandmother Smeed, whom she finds a complete bore. The tears spill onto the magazine and seem to bring the fountain to life with the tears of all the lonely girls like Judy. Seeing the fountain in this way helps Judy make a connection with the fountain and draws her toward finding it the first time. "

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between Lois and Lorraine in The Haunted Fountain, and how does it relate to Judy's involvement in a double-wedding event that nearly went awry due to her mystery-solving attempts?",
        "Article": " id=\"chap01\">\n  CHAPTER I\n  \n An Unsolved Mystery\n  \n  \u201cTell Judy about it,\u201d begged Lois. \u201cPlease, Lorraine,\nit can\u2019t be as bad as it appears. There isn\u2019t\nanything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters\nnow. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be\nloyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s\npart. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double\nwedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe\nshe\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.\nEveryone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no\nexception.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming\nin to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited\nfor lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have\nproblems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t\nsolve.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one\nsingle spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll\nbelieve you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved\nall those mysteries. I met you when the whole\nvalley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened\nby flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,\nnot me. He was the hero without even meaning to\nbe. He was the one who rode through town and\nwarned people that the flood was coming. I was off\nchasing a shadow.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.\n\u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.\n\u201cI know now that keeping that promise not\nto talk about the dam was a great big mistake and\ncould have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding\nher pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk\nabout?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve\nsolved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or\ntwo before the flood, but what about the haunted\n  house you moved into? You were the one who\ntracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar\nand goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing\nghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did\nyou fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,\n\u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There\nwas one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but\nwhat she was or how she spoke to me is more than\nI know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.\nAnd now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.\nThey left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with\nthis house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of\nthem when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re\nstored in one end of the attic.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed\nLois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and\nshow up the spooks?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She\nwasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,\nbut Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally\ntold them, the summer before they met. Horace\nhad just started working on the paper. Judy remembered\nthat it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton\nLee, who gave him his job with the\n   \n   Farringdon\nDaily Herald\n   \n  . He had turned in some interesting\nchurch news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him\n  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that\nhe spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon\nwhere the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted\nmansion, while she had to suffer the heat and\nloneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she\nconfessed now as she reviewed everything that had\nhappened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact\nthat her parents left her every summer while they\nwent off on a vacation by themselves. What did they\nthink she would do?\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told\nher. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery\nseries you like. When they\u2019re finished there are\nplenty of short stories around. Your grandmother\nnever throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s\nsaved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for\nthem she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how\nyou love to read.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired\neyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a\nvacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too\nlittle to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to\nthe beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It\nwas a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton\nand his wife relived it. And every summer Judy\nwent to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who\nscolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t\nglad to have her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,\nand Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling\nbehind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with\nyourself this time?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say\nyou have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you\ncan stand the heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so\nmuch as to escape to a place where she could have a\ngood cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth\nbirthday. In another year she would have outgrown\nher childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or\nbe grown up enough to ask them to let her have a\nvacation of her own. In another year she would\nbe summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands\nand solving a mystery to be known as the\n   \n   Ghost\nParade\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling\nher, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d\n  \n \n  But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no\nidea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There\nseemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears\ncame and spilled over on one of the magazines. As\nJudy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen\non a picture of a fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d\nshe remembered saying aloud.\n  \n \n  Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of\nwalking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett\nmansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a\nfountain still caught and held rainbows like those\nshe was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.\nBut all that was in the future. If anyone had told\nthe freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one\nday marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in\ntheir faces.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat tease!\u201d\n  \n \n  For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who\nused to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day\nshe yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so\nare you!\u201d\n  \n \n  Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a\nkitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.\nThe kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the\nsummer Judy found the picture of a fountain and\nspilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,\nshe confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to\npretend the fountain in the picture was filled with\nall the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly\nexclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered\nit distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother\n  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,\n\u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people\nknow your wishes instead of muttering them to\nyourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what\nJudy was telling them without interruption.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  And she went on to tell them how, the very next\nday, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain\nexactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center\nof a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.\nBeside the steps were smaller fountains with the\nwater spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy\nhad stared at them a moment and then climbed the\nsteps to the pool.\n  \n \n  \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.\n\u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d\n  \n \n  A voice had answered, although she could see no\none.\n  \n \n  \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you\nshed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely\ncome true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a\ntear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will\nsurely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded\nher. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up\nthere in the attic?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2014you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered\nexclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It\ndoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had\nsaid in a mysterious whisper.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> id=\"chap02\">\n  CHAPTER II\n  \n If Wishes Came True\n  \n  \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.\n\u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> id=\"chap03\">\n  CHAPTER III\n  \n A Strange Encounter\n  \n  Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed\ntrip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to\nit under one condition. They were not to drive all\nthe way to the house which, she said, was just over\nthe hilltop. They were to park the car where no\none would see it and follow the path to the fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n  \n \n  Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.\nShe and Lois both argued that it would be better to\ninquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.\n  \n \n  \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it\nlooks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they\nstarted off in the blue car she was driving.\n  \n \n  It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and\neasy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed\nand said if they did find the fountain she thought\nshe\u2019d wish for one exactly like it.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said\nabout wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you\nlet people know about them instead of muttering\nthem to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know\nabout this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon\nbe Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur\ncoat he gave me last year.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too\nwarm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this\ntrip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves\nas it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.\n  \n \n  The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they\nhad covered the distance that had seemed such a\nlong way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s\nwagon.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve\njust about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t\nthink my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough\nto pay them a visit, though. We must have looked\nqueer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s\nold farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had\n  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t\nexplain what happened afterwards. When I woke\nup in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,\nwagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois.\n  \n \n  \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to\nsee how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  Again she broke off as if there were something\nshe wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare.\n  \n \n  \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy.\n  \n \n  \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You\nwere telling us how you woke up in the hammock,\nbut you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d\nLorraine reminded her.\n  \n \n  \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,\nbut it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember\ndriving home along this road. You see, I thought my\ngrandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise\nand would return for me. I told you I was all alone.\nThere wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next\nhill,\u201d Lois put in.\n  \n \n  \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I\ncouldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old\ntower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,\nI followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in\nthe woods that always tempts me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about\nyour latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where\nthe hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d\nJudy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes\npeered out at me from unexpected places. I was\nactually scared by the time I reached the old tower.\nThere wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard\nthe rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he\nwas driving off without me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,\nand Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like\nthat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop\nand wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.\n\u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered\nthem, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for\nMrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they\nturned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.\n  \n \n  \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s\nanother car coming.\u201d\n  \n \n  As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine\nducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind\nJudy until the car had passed. The man driving\nit was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember\nhis hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a\nlong time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered\nmost of his hair.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois\nwhen the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for\nplaying hide and seek?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine\nbegged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there\nany more.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,\ncan\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly.\n  \n \n  She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew\nmore about the Brandt estate than she was telling.\n  \n \n  Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly\nroad. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge\nof rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very\ngreen next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.\nThe sky was gray with white clouds being driven\nacross it by the wind.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can\nsee it over to the left. It looks like something out of\nGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder\nwhat it is.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It\nwould be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut\nif there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give\nus permission.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy\nsuggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends\nas Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the\nroad. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to\nexplore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for\nthe fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf\nyou know anything about the people who live here\nnow, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,\nI\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do\nknow who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember\nRoger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?\nI\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have\nacquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on\nthe estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you\ntell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places\ntogether.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.\n\u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a\ncar of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger\nBanning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better\nthan that. I did know him slightly, but not from\nschool. The boys and girls were separated and went\nto different high schools by the time we moved to\n  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a\nlot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at\nchurch.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer\nmention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy.\n  \n \n  Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts\nto gossip.\n  \n \n  \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from\nhis father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important\nbusiness people. I think he forged some legal\ndocuments, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.\nIt was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her.\n  \n \n  Now Judy did remember. It was something she\nwould have preferred to forget. She liked to think\nshe was a good judge of character, and she had taken\nDick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would\nnever stoop to crime.\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d\nLois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look\nfor it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I\njust like to know what a tiger looks like before he\nsprings at me,\u201d Judy explained.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition\nof ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine.\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who\nseems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.\n  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve\nseen that character who drove down this road and,\nfor some reason, you were afraid he would see you.\nWhy, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied\nevasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private\nestates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,\n\u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect\nwe\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused\nof trespassing.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two\ndark-coated figures strode down the road toward\nthem. \u201cYou drove right by a\n  NO TRESPASSING\n  sign,\nand this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to\nmeet us!\u201d\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Lois and Lorraine became sisters by marriage as they both married into the Farringdon-Petts family in a double-wedding event. Judy (a sister to Lois by way of her marrying Lois\u2019 brother, Peter Dobbs), nearly ruined the double-wedding trying to solve a mystery.\nLois is perhaps more forgiving to Judy, and Lorraine goes as far as to describe that Lois has always taken Judy\u2019s side. Both Lois and Lorraine acknowledge that Judy is great at solving mysteries and try to lift her up when she is down on herself about the few that she couldn\u2019t solve when they come over for lunch. \nLorraine becomes evasive and hides from view when the three of them go to the fountain together, concealing information about the new owners of the Brandt estate that Lois and Judy eventually get out of her by probing questions. This event shows Lois\u2019 willingness to challenge Lorraine, and perhaps also supporting \u201cJudy\u2019s side\u201d as Lois calls her out on earlier in the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Lois and Lorraine are sisters-in-law who want to look out for one another. Lois is excitable and very giggly, whereas Lorraine is a bit more mild-tempered and careful, less sure about having Blackberry the cat around. Lorraine is going through an emotional time when this story takes place, only admitting small bits of information at a time about how she doesn't trust Arthur anymore, but won't give up more detail when pushed. Judy found Lorraine to seem somewhat jealous, but both Judy and Lois seem to know that Lorraine is keeping something from them. On the other hand, Lois is very open and encourages the others to speak their minds to work through anything that might be bothering them. ",
        "Summary_3": "Lois and Lorraine are sisters-in-law who care for each other, although Lorraine can sometimes be difficult to get along with. Lois is the friendlier, perkier of the two, while Lorraine is brooding and distrusting. Lorraine has a jealous streak that interfered with the budding friendship between Lois and Judy, and even now, Lorraine complains that Lois always sides with Judy. She also holds grudges, as she brings up the point that Judy almost ruined their double wedding. Lorraine has a problem that appears to be related to her husband, and Lois thinks Lorraine should tell Judy about it because Judy is so good at solving problems and mysteries. When Judy mentions Arthur, Lorraine looks as though she is in pain and asks the others not to talk about him now. Later, she comments that she wishes she could go back in the past to the time when she trusted Arthur, and when they meet the oncoming car on the way to the Brandt estate, she hides herself from the driver. Lois encourages Lorraine to tell her what her problem is, but Lorraine won\u2019t. All day, Lois engages in eager conversation, asking Judy questions as she tells her story, while Lorraine appears lost, glum, and hurt; Lorraine starts comments that she doesn\u2019t finish and mysteriously seems to know more about the Brandt estate than she will tell the other two women.",
        "Summary_4": "Lois and Lorraine appear to be sisters. At one point, Judy is recounting how she wished for a sister her age, and Lois squeezes Lorraine's hand, proclaiming that her future held a sister just like Judy's future held a sister. It isn't clear, however, if they are biological sisters or symbolic sisters. Judy is describing more of a symbolic relationship with a woman of her age, but Lois does not clarify if her relationship with Lorraine is by blood or simply by love like how Judy is describing. Either way, the two characters seem very close and care for one another deeply."

Already I am static\nand for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe\nwith fear and trepidation.\n  \n \n  As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but got\nno response. What could have diminished your powers of articulate\nwave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and\nreturning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing\nand surrounded with an impregnable chimera.\n  \n \n  Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the\nnot-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by what\nthe not-world calls \"mail\" till we meet. For this purpose I must\nutilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose\ninadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.\nEach time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.\n  \n \n  I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary\nreports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury\nof facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free\nof the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in\nyour task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we\nreturn again.\n  \n \n  The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of\nBombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.\nTomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact\nlocation, for the not-people might have access to the information.\n  \n \n  I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it\nis alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from\nthe pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational\nlikeness.\n  \n \n  I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among\nthem. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway\nlies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in\norder that I might destroy the not-people completely.\n  \n \n  All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too\nfast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision.\nGezsltrysk, what a task!\n  \n \n  Farewell till later.\n  \n \n  Glmpauszn\n  \n<doc-sep>All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.\n  \n<doc-sep>Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and\nthought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the\ngirl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that\n   \n   was\n   \n  my name.\n  \n \n  \"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like\nwaterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help\n   \n   me\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.\n  \n \n  She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.\n\"What do you think of this?\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.\n  \n \n \n   Dear Acolyte R. I.

The counterman was\ntrying to pull it out.\n  \n \n  I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a\ncup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and\na pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five\u2014if the\nlady didn't pay you.\"\n  \n \n  \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that\nbill out of your hand?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman\nput down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant\nbar, smoothing it.\n  \n \n  I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the\nsidewalk, only in the doorways.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Alec Graham returns to his home from the office after a long day. His wife Molly has left, and he still feels that it looks wife-deserted even after doing many chores to clean it up. He recounts his bad day, having forgotten to set his alarm and rushing to the TV Studio that he writes for. The taxi driver refuses to take him to Madison and Fifty-fourth, and the rain has gotten worse. His hand continuously bleeds after passing by a big excavation site, and he misses his story conference. After hearing the same phrases numerous times and all six elevators being jammed, he is convinced that he is coincidence prone. Molly leaves him instructions on how to take care of himself, and he works on his novel. More of these events happen with pigeons colliding and somebody getting five straight-flushes in a row. Nat tells Alec about the strange occurrence as they get soda. The three bottles do not break after falling at least five feet, and Danny, the cop, is shocked. Outside, more strange events occur when Nat almost gets caught up with a swerving taxi. Once they return home, he immediately calls McGill, an assistant mathematics professor for some expert advice. Once McGill arrives, he says that all of the events are very improbable, which makes him inclined to believe that Alec is stringing him on or subject to delusion. They do an experiment involving coin-throwing, and all of the coins are arranged in a neat pile when Alec throws them. McGill asks him some more questions about any recent occurrences, but Alec suggests that they go outside to eat. Outside, the cars are being towed away, while two pedestrians are having trouble letting each other pass. Danny is confused by all that is happening. Alec also runs into Molly, stuck in a confused wrangle of umbrellas with two other women. She explains that somebody from their home had kept calling her mother\u2019s number, so she came back to investigate. Back at the apartment, all of this is traced back to Alec as the center. McGill tries to explain what is possibly happening to Alec, but they are interrupted by the telephone repairman. Molly suggests they go out to a restaurant to eat, and Nat comes along. They pass by the car jam again, and the police lieutenant looks at Alec with interest. Even at the restaurant, Alec realizes that his Tom Collins drink is made with salt instead of sugar. When the bartender tries to remake the drink for them, the shaker has frozen solid. It happens again with a new shaker, and the waiter is extremely confused. When Alec\u2019s hand collides with Molly\u2019s cigarette, it goes into the neighboring lady\u2019s vichyssoise. The two of them are displeased, and when Alec stands up, he ends up pulling all of the contents on their entire table onto the floor. The lady and the man are furious at Alec; even the owner has come to fix the situation. ",
        "Summary_2": "Alec returns to his apartment after a day at the office, feeling worn out and defeated. He recalls the events from earlier that day; he had forgotten to set his alarm clock, making him late for a conference at the advertising studio he works at. He had forgotten an umbrella and found himself in the pouring rain, where he caught a taxi only for it to not start. The subways had suffered delays as well. On his walk to the office, Alec passed by a construction site, where he was nicked by a piece of glass from an explosion. He ended up missing his conference, and on his way home, a cop tells him that the elevators in his office building had all broken down as soon as he left. Alec reflects on these events, perplexed by the accident-prone coincidences. He decides to write at his typewriter when he drops his pencil, finding that it has landed standing on its end. As he continues to be stunned by the events, he fixes a drink for himself, taking note of the several notes that his wife, Molly, had left him while she visits her mother. Alec then witnesses a card game between his neighbor, Nat, and a group of men, in which Nat draws five straight flushes. Alec invites Nat in after the heated game, and after breaking a soda, they go to the corner store to buy more, where the bottles fall through the bottom of the bag. As the two walk back to their apartment, Nat is nearly bumped into and he steps onto the curb, causing a severe accident between multiple cars. Nat later leaves to his office to write an article about the strange events, and Alec calls up McGill, a mathematics professor and friend. McGill comes to Alec's apartment, and he is suspicious that he may be delusional or lying, due to the impossible probability of the events occurring. McGill then tosses some change onto the floor, testing to see if they all land on heads; instead, the coins stack up on top of each other. McGill is also confused, trying to imagine an explanation, and Alec suggests that some form of life is controlling the events. The two go out for food and pass by three women who have their umbrellas tangled up together. One of the women turns out to be Molly, who says she returned after her mother had been receiving constant calls from Alec's phone with no one on the other end. They go back to the apartment and discuss the matter, as the telephone repairman arrives. After, the three go to a restaurant, and face more inconveniences, such as having salt in their drink instead of sugar. Alec then accidentally drops a cigarette onto a neighboring party, and the woman gets angry, as Alec somehow pulls their tablecloth and dinner onto the floor, angering many. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with Alec missing his wife\u2019s presence as he feels lost without her aid in his life. He details how his commute to work was heavily hindered by unlucky transportation happenings and awful weather. When Alec leaves work and gets back to his apartment, he attempts to write a bit. In addition, he thinks over the strange coincidences that have happened during the day thus far. Upon hearing a loud commotion in his apartment building hallway, he goes to investigate. He finds his neighbor Nat in an argument with a group of men accusing Nat of cheating. In a fit of rage, one of the men hits the deck of cards that Nat is holding, causing them to be tossed to the floor. In another strange coincidence, half of the cards land face down but all the face-up cards are red. The group of men leave in confusion and Alec invites Nat into his apartment for a drink to cool down. \n\nAfter consuming most of the club soda, the two men leave to grab more club soda in a nearby deli. At the deli, another strange incident occurs. The 3 glasses of club soda fall through a thin plastic bag, 5 feet towards the ground and do not break when they should have broken due to the fall. The storekeeper is shocked but Alec shrugs off the weird incident. Nat and Alec return to his apartment where he notices more strange coincidences. Alec grows frustrated and decides to call his friend McGill to help him make sense of everything. McGill promptly comes over to Alec\u2019s apartment to help. McGill gets to the apartment and Alec tries to explain all of the coincidences. McGill is understandably very skeptical and wants Alec to prove it for his own eyes. \n\nAlec is able to prove that something strange his happening with a demonstration that involves throwing coins to the floor. The coins are thrown and somehow clustered together into a perfectly stacked pile. McGill then begins to believe Alec. He is uncertain about the probability of the coincidences but refuses to attribute it to superstitious happenings and states that it is an unknown force. When the two leave to go get food, they see and meet up with Molly on the street and quickly return to the apartment to catch Molly up on the strange occurrences. After much discussion over what could be causing the day\u2019s incidents, they decide to all go to get food. They order drinks at the restaurant, but mysteriously the shaker is causing the liquids to freeze. Molly notes how the restaurant is continuously becoming warmer, and later Alec mentally notes that he can no longer hear the sound of the air conditioner. While preparing to discuss the issue of the AC, Alec accidentally flips his cigarette onto another occupied table. This causes a heated argument with the other guests and the unapproving look from the owner of the restaurant towards Alec. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Alec, the narrator, had a very weird and exhausting day. In the morning he overslept work and hurried out. A rain storm started the subway was delayed and there was a huge excavation on his way. The drill working with clay hit something glittering inside and a little explosion happened. The narrator's face was slightly scratched and bleeding. His absence at the conference wasn't noticed. Back home Alec saw his wife's nots with directions all around as she left to attend to her mother. Then he tried to write his novel and came to a dead end, so he poured himself a drink and watched some pigeons being trained outside, when some traffic occurred and a couple birds fell. There were loud voices outside: four men confronted the narrator's neighbor, a shy guy named Nat. Then the man came in for a drink, and told Alec that he had miraculously won in cards a couple times in a row, and his partners believed he had cheated. The narrator and Nat went out for sodas in glass bottles, which fell and miraculously did not break. On the street, a pedestrian, who suddenly stopped in front of Nat, caused a series of accidents leading to a huge traffic jam. Back at Alec's place, the curtain was weirdly tied in three knots and he called his knowledgeable friend McGill to get a consultation. The man came and considered all of the day's weird events very improbable but not impossible. McGill offered to make a demonstration, so Alec threw a handful of coins which bounced together, stacking into a neat pile. McGill's coins created an exactly straight line. McGill stated that Alec was the center of the weird events and there must be some design in that. They went out to eat and the cars were wrecking all along their way, overwhelming the cops. Two people were unable to go past each other, they fought making the same motions and saying identical words. Many similar situations were happening all around. One of the women with intertwined umbrellas was Molly, the wife. Her mother's number was constantly dialed with no one on the line, and Alec's number was always busy, so Molly got worried. At that point Danny, the local policeman, started suspecting Alec. The three went out for dinner eventually and took Nat with them, who wanted to hear the story. Alec dropped his cigarettes out of the pack under the suspicious gaze of Danny and a lieutenant. In the restaurant the whole company got salty drinks which puzzled the bartender. When he tried to do the new ones, nothing came out of the shaker - everything inside turned into ice. The place suddenly started getting warmer and quieter. Alec's hand collided with Molly's and her cigarette fell into the dish of a perturbed lady at the nearby table. While standing up, Alec accidentally pulled everything from that table to the floor and the angry lady slapped him. "

He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\nthe dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\ncontinue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n  \n \n  He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\npicked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\ntheir leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\npollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\ndelicate wings.

In the home, there is also carpet, cushions, and ashtrays for cigarettes. Alec also owns an alarm clock to help him wake up. In the living room, there is also a typewriter and a telephone. Alec tries to go to his conference in New York, but it is raining heavily, and the cab refuses to take him to his destination. However, the story also mentions the subway, which he takes. Alec\u2019s stop is Fifty-first and Lexington. There is also mention of a big excavation site for a new building. On his way to the studio, he also stops at the drugstore. There are also at least six elevators in his building. Around the corner of the apartment, there is a delicatessen that sells soda. On the streets outside, cars are jamming into each other and have to be towed away. Later, the story is set in a restaurant near Sixth Avenue. The restaurant is crowded but cool, and there is a bar too. There is also background music and the faint hum of the air-conditioner, both that stop shortly after. \n",

Alec lives in an apartment complex in a comfortable home, containing a living room where he keeps his typewriter, a small kitchen, and a bedroom. Alec's living room window offers a view of the roof across from him. Throughout the story, Alec visits many different places. In addition to his office, he goes to a small corner store to purchase soda, as well as a restaurant near Sixth Avenue. ",
        "Summary_3": "The main setting of the story is presumed to be in Manhattan in New York City. Alec goes to different parts of the city due to work, where he lives, and for food. His commute on the subway was fraught with troubles and he ends up missing a meeting at work, though his absence goes unnoticed. His wife, Molly, who was visiting her mother, finds him on the street surrounded by a bunch of commotion. Alec, his wife, and McGill return to Alec\u2019s apartment to discuss what has been happening. After much discussion, they go out to eat. As more strange coincidences happen at the restaurant, Molly notes how it keeps getting warmer. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts in Alec's apartment which looks wife-deserted as Molly, his wife, is visiting her mother. All around the apartment there are what-to-do notes from Molly. Alec rushes out for his job and it starts raining really bad outside. The cab doesn't move and he gets into the subway. Then he exits near his job, there is a huge excavation nearby, with men drilling clay and some spectators. Inside one piece of clay there is something shiny, like glass. Alec gets to his TV studio and soon takes the subway back home. At home he makes a drink in the kitchen and sits down in the living room with some papers which are supposedly his future novel and a typewriter. Weird events like a pencil standing straight and a tied in three knots curtain keep happening. From the window Alec sees a man exercising a flock of pigeons on the rooftop and a weird traffic occurs among the birds. Alec hears loud voices and opens the door to see his neighbor, Nat, being confronted by four men in the hallway. The two get into Alec's apartment and soon go out for sodas. At the delicatessen on the corner, Alec drops three bottles of water but they don't break. A series of accidents happen on the road outside and create an enormous traffic jam. Soon, Alec is alone in his apartment and invites his friend McGill to figure out the weird happenings. After a couple more very unprovable events they go out for food. The traffic outside is incredible, every car wrecks and pedestrians can't get past one another and fight. Molly appears among the women fighting over umbrellas and the three go back home. After a couple more weird events including the broken phone, they take Nat and go to a restaurant after all. The traffic on the street is still crazy. The restaurant is air-conditioned and noisy. The drinks are salty, and when the bartender tries to redo them, the liquid freezes, gathering many spectators. The air gets warmer and another accident creates a fight between Alec and a lady at the next table.\n"

He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "McGill is an assistant mathematics professor at a nearby university. He is friends with both Alec and Molly, even calling to ask about the both of them. He is considered to be highly imaginative, but they believe that he knows everything. Personality-wise, McGill is a very logical person. He believes that what Alec has told him is normally impossible, and the odds against it are very astronomical as well. Even when Alec shows him what has happened to him, he continues to pursue a logical explanation. However, despite these theories, he tries to approach these findings logically and tells Alec not to be superstitious when they initially discuss why this is happening to him. ",
        "Summary_2": "McGill works at a university as an assistant professor of mathematics. He is known to be extremely intelligent, as well as imaginative, as Alec describes him. McGill is eager to help Alec explain his improbable luck, both out of friendship and excitement by his passion for science. Though McGill is imaginative, he is also skeptical and not easily gullible, as shown when he is wary of Alec's legitimacy behind his claims. However, he can easily think outside of the box, and uses his knowledge of science to propose unheard possibilities.",

He is described as being very imaginative, but his advice is held in high regard. He is quick to help Alec after a simple phone call with no explanation of Alec\u2019s need. When Alec explains the strange occurrences throughout the day, McGill is skeptical but willing to give Alec the benefit of the doubt. He routinely measures the likelihood of occurrences in an analytical manner that relies on probability. ",

They are close enough for Alec to call and ask McGill to come straight away, who comes immediately. Alec and some other people from his company consider McGill very knowledgeable about all sort of things. He is open to anything and considers every possibility, even the impossible and supernatural as long as he doesn't have any other explanation. However, he believes this case to be very weird and improbable but not impossible - he has scientific approach to everything. He is interested in weird happenings and willing to find the answer.

        "Summary_1": "Alec is tired, upset, and confused about the strange coincidences relating to him. When he first goes home, he is extremely tired and compares his day to be the same as being beaten down. Judging from the events throughout his workday, he does not understand how they all relate to him and thinks of them as extremely weird coincidences. He even thinks of himself as being coincidence-prone. After the soda incident, however, he no longer finds it surprising after all that has happened to him. As the events build up, Alec slowly realizes that he is the center of it all, and he knows that he cannot get out of it. No matter how hard he tries, he directly interacts with or is nearby becomes strange coincidences. ",
        "Summary_2": "As the strange coincidences occur in the story, Alec becomes increasingly frustrated. However, instead of driving him to the point of rage, the frustration drives him to exhaustion. At the beginning of the story, Alec already describes himself as feeling beaten down due to the morning's events. He feels more and more defeated as the day goes on, but also becomes more and more perplexed and fascinated. By the end of the story, Alec feels both helpless due to his uncontrollable bad luck and eager to find an explanation for this rare scenario, seeking other people for help and validation.",
        "Summary_3": "For a large portion of the story, Alec is very casual about the strange coincidences that occur. He acknowledges them but does not fuss over them as much as those who also see them. When he is told that he just missed being stuck in his office building\u2019s elevators, he brushes it off as another coincidence. He does the same when his pencil lands on the floor standing on its end. Towards the end of the story, he grows more aware of the coincidences and becomes frustrated with them. The story ends with him getting into a heated argument at a restaurant when it is assumed that he purposefully flew his cigarette at an occupied table. ",
        "Summary_4": "The first coincidences are just some bad luck as Alec thinks. When one oversleeps something important and is in a hurry, series of delaying events can happen as some bad luck. He is simply nervous about missing the conference, and tired of constant failures. It'[s also hard for him to live without his wife, his place looks wife-deserted which upsets him and this is the part of the reasons for his tardiness. When his absence isn't noticed, he returns home in a better mood and tries to write. Nothing helps though and Alec is stuck. Unnatural events start happening which distract him, at first, they simply surprise Alec. Later, they become more strong, often highly improbable - not breaking bottles, traffic, especially the three knots on the curtain. These ones look impossible to Alec and therefore scare him, so he calls McGill for a consultation. Further evidence convinces Alec in him being the center of a huge mess. He is confused and tries to hide his failures from the overseers."

        "Summary_1": "Peter Karson has finished planning out the blueprint for the Citadel. He is excited to see it be built and go off into space to collect new information. Something suddenly snaps him out of his fantasy. Fifty stories above the window, there is a blood-red and subtly inhuman face staring back at him. The face slowly disappears, but he is stunned by the image. He then shakingly lights a cigarette and turns on the newsbox to see that an invader has appeared in Boston. More disasters are listed below, and the World Police announces that the Invaders have already begun terrorizing the world since they appeared twenty-four hours ago. Peter is doubtful that they can take down the Invaders and goes to Lorelei Cooper\u2019s laboratory. Lorelei does not know what is happening because Harry and she have been working for thirty-six hours straight. She does not have a newsbox, but he tells her to turn on her scanner to see the news. The panel shows the Science City of Manhattan, but the Invaders have come and snatched up men and women. Slowly, two Invaders make their way to the Atlas building, where Peter and Lorelei are. He goes into the inner room, even though she yells at him not to go. The Invaders have reduced Harry to nothing but a puddle of flesh, and Peter begins to ask why they are doing this desperately. They whisper to him in a strange language; he suddenly realizes that Lorelei has followed him. She drops to the floor after looking at the Invaders, which makes Peter scream. When he awakes again, a doctor named Arnold tells him to lie back down and that he is in a hospital. Although Dr. Arnold initially tells him that he has been in the hospital for three months, he eventually finds out that it has already been nine and a half months since he went into his coma. All of the survivors are underground because nobody knew how to kill the Invaders. Peter is considered their last hope because he is a scientist, and he thinks back to his plan of the Citadel. The ship is built, and it is called The Avenger instead. Lorelei tries to plead with Peter, but he refuses and says that it must be him who finds a superman that can destroy the Invaders. He goes into space until the ship curves into orbit. Peter kills many of the changeling children, but he allows one to live. The child is named Robert and is considered to be a super-intelligent being. Peter is hopeful that the changeling can kill the Invaders, but Robert says he will not return to Earth. He explains that they are like kin to him, and he logically has no reason to kill him. Peter is shocked and tries to plead with Robert, but the superman does not understand emotions. Robert does not feel good about the expression on Peter\u2019s face, and he hastens to an inevitable end. ",
        "Summary_2": "Blood is dripping from a dead body in the room, Peter Karson. The story moves to the past, when young Peter finished the project of 'Citadel' - a spaceship to set off to an orbit. 'Citadel' was supposed to be a huge well-equipped laboratory, the first of its kind. While imagining the greatness of the creation, Peter felt dread and saw a face staring at him outside the window, fifty stories up. The face was scary and inhuman, the body hung without support for a while and then disappeared. Everything around was normal and Peter was worried he had gone mad. Then he saw the red headlines in the newspapers about appearing invaders and disappearing people. Cities worldwide were attacked and the World Police were mobilizing. The news proclaimed that the greatest enemy was to be faced and defeated. Peter rushed downstairs to Lorelei's laboratory, who had been working without breaks and hadn't seen the news. After Peter's agonized pleas, Lorelei turned on the news and saw a video of people becoming an unrecognizable joined mass, helpless and suffering. Then the two saw their own building in the news and halted. Peter went towards the inner room despite Lorelei's protests. He saw two aliens staring at Harry, Lorelei's assistant, and turning him into a boneless mess. Peter was so shocked that he screamed \"why?\" and heard some incomprehensible whisper in his head in response. Suddenly, Peter saw that Lorelei had followed him and her body dropped to the floor. Peter screamed inhumanely loudly and faded. He woke up in a hospital, the doctor said he had been very sick for three months and that Lorelei was fine. When Peter kept asking, he finally learned that he had been in a coma for more than nine months because of the rather long contact he had had with the invaders. Lorelei was simply shocked and recovered much faster. Arnold, the doctor, finally decided that Peter was strong enough to learn the truth and told about the part of humanity hiding underground as killing the aliens turned out to be impossible. Peter was needed as a scientist. His 'Citadel' project contained everything necessary to live a lifetime, it was a new independent world to save the rest of humanity. So, it was renamed 'The Avenger' and finished, as life underground was not a solution but a delay. Lorelei was in despair because of Peter boarding the ship and wanted to follow, but the rays were strong and even Peter had low chances of staying alive. When 'The Avenger' reached orbit, Peter felt the rays burning his flesh and smashed the mirrors to allow the embryos to mature. After a long time Peter told the story to Robert, the mutation-child with a superior brain who could destroy the invaders. Robert refused to go to Earth as his brain was logical and saw no reasons to destroy the Invaders. Peter didn't understand and the inevitable end approached. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story opens with the character Peter Karson dead, as the narrator, identity unknown, contemplates their emptiness after killing him. The narrator says that they do not regret doing so, but they are unable to explain their emotions as they feel a tear rolling down their cheek. The story then goes back to a younger Peter as he finishes his project, the development of the Citadel spaceship. He suddenly hears a strange whisper within his brain, and he turns around to see a face with a shriveled body staring at him through the window. The creature slowly dissolves and disappears, and Peter is left stunned. He finds breaking news of invasions all over the world, murdering hundreds of civilians. The invaders, according to Secretary of the Council, are from outer space, and the World Police is attempting to destroy them. Peter rushes downstairs to find Lorelei, his lover, in the laboratory. She is unaware of the news, and upon seeing footage of the gruesome attacks, she is shocked, and they soon see the invaders approaching their building from the television. Peter steps into another room, seeing the two creatures with their focus on Harry Kanin, Lorelei's assistant. To Peter's horror, Harry quickly becomes a limp pile of flesh. Peter confronts the creatures but only hears foreign whispers, as Lorelei drops to the floor behind him. Peter lets out a scream, and wakes up in a hospital. The doctor tells him that he has been there in a coma for over nine months, and that Lorelei had recovered from shock. The doctor then tells Peter that society has moved to living underground in order to avoid the invaders; Peter, as a scientist, is their last hope. Later, Peter approaches the newly crafted spaceship, titled The Avenger, which lacks the typical shield to protect one from cosmic rays. Lorelei begs Peter not to go, but he believes it is necessary, and too much of a risk for Lorelei to join him. He boards the ship with the mission to create a \"superman\" to ultimately defeat the invaders; the plan is to allow the cosmic rays to mutate several embryos on board, hopefully creating a strong enough being. As The Avenger leaves and goes into orbit, Peter begins feeling the effects of the rays as his skin and hair mutates. As time passes, he allows the embryos to develop, destroying all but one. He raises the embryo as it develops into a person, and the story jumps many years later, as the child becomes a man named Robert. Peter had raised Robert, with a superior brain and logical ability, to be the defeater of the invaders. Informing Robert of the plan to return back to Earth, Robert surprisingly refuses. Peter is taken aback, and Robert explains that he is not able to comprehend the emotions that would lead him to kill the invaders and save Earthmen. Peter begs helplessly, and Robert ultimately feels it inevitable to kill him. ",

He finishes his work for the moment and turns on the news to discover horrifying imagery and chaos being reported. He runs to Lorelei Cooper\u2019s laboratory to go share the disturbing news with her. Lorelei and Peter have a romantic relationship. He asks Lorelei to turn on the news and she is shocked by the imagery that is being detailed. Both Peter and Lorelei become stunned when they realize that the invaders to Earth are headed towards their building. They hold each other in stunned silence until they hear a scream from Lorelei\u2019s assistant, Harry Kanin. Peter goes out to investigate and discovers the Invaders turning Harry\u2019s body into nothing but flesh. Unbeknownst to Peter, Lorelei followed him and when the Invaders are done with Harry they begin to focus on her to Peter\u2019s terror.\n\nPeter then wakes up in a hospital bed. After much prodding, he is eventually informed that he has been in a coma for a little over nine months. He is told that humans are losing the fight against the Invaders and have retreated to living underground. He is soon informed that he must gain back his strength because as a scientist he is much needed in the fight against the Invaders.\n\nThe story then goes into detail about how Peter has been chosen to go to space on the Avenger ship and raise a viable embryo that has successfully mutated due to cosmic rays. The resulting person will then be used to fight against the Invaders. He does this while orbiting space on the ship. He destroys the inappropriate creations and keeps one embryo that sees as potential. That would grow up to be Robert. Many years have passed as he raises Robert. Eventually, he tells Robert the story of how he was created and details the mission that he is meant to carry out. Robert has great brain prowess due to his mutations and Peter is hopeful that he will be able to successfully fight against the invaders.\n\nHowever, Robert soon informs Peter that he will not go through with the plan. He reasons that he does not experience emotion and has no reason to care for the humans on Earth. Peter is greatly upset as he realizes his life\u2019s work failed and Earth will not be able to save. \n"

It was supposed to be a huge metal laboratory-spaceship. The ship was to have many levels of laboratories and storerooms, the meteor deflectors, the air renewal system and the mighty engines. Suddenly, Peter felt some kind of dread around, he looked out from the window of his office and saw a horrible creature fifty stories up. Then he took the newspapers from his newsboy and saw the headlines about the invaders. He rushed two floors down through the staircase to the radioactive laboratory, where Lorelei, his girlfriend, was working. She was in the forest corner with a huge ledger. The two went to the scanner to watch the news and suddenly saw their own building, a tall, pure white structure. The silence was oppressive. Peter moved towards the inner room and confronted the aliens. Then he woke up in a sort of hospital after a long coma, he couldn't understand where he was and for how long. All the major cities were destroyed. People were digging to hide underground, but it was a delay rather than a solution. A new ship 'The Avenger' was built following the model of 'Citadel'. 'The Avenger' wasn't that big as 'Citadel' was supposed to be, it was a steel globe with compressed oxygen and concentrated food enough for a lifetime. Peter boarded the ship and sealed the door, then he sank down on the floor, knowing his low chances of staying alive. He closed the inner door and walked to the control room. He turned the keys and was pressed into the chair. He passed the moon and Mars and reached orbit. He felt the rays burning him there and broke the windows. For years he watched the embryos grow until Robert, the needed mutation, appeared. Peter fed him with knowledge for years. Earth was a tiny blue star far away, where many more years passed.

They know each other's habits - the lock on the laboratory, the lack of newsboy at Lorelei's. Peter worries for her more than for himself, and losing his girlfriend means his own death to him, that's the reason he gives for her not to follow him to the orbit.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell.

        "Summary_1": "The Avenger ship is what is built from Peter\u2019s shining dream. It is much smaller than his initial blueprint, a globe of raw-dura steel no more than five hundred meters in diameter. It cannot house a thousand scientists, and the huge compartments are not filled with the latest equipment for experiments. Instead, it is filled with compressed oxygen and concentrated food to last a lifetime. There is also a control room, engine room, airlock, and inner lock. The Avenger ship is essential because it is the key to finding a superman who can save human civilization. Since the Invaders have caused the remaining population to burrow underground, this ship carries all hopes for the future. Peter believes that there is a chance that one embryo will be genetically modified enough to become a changeling who can save humanity. That is why he is willing to take the chance on the ship and realize his dream, even if it is not the dream he initially had in mind. ",

This was the only hope for the humanity to be saved as they couldn't defeat the Aliens with their own forces. Robert is that one right mutation, a superman. There was a flaw in the calculations though, as a coldly logical being Robert has no reasons for destroying the Aliens. He doesn't have feeling, so he doesn't have compassion towards the humans to help them. Moreover, as the Invaders are easy for him to understand, he is rather on their side. He cares for Peter as much as he can, but his gratitude can't overcome his lack of desire to do something. After Peter's death, he can't feel emotions either but he feels some emptiness inside, which shows he has developed some warmth towards Peter.

        "Query": "How do the Earthmen impact the Masur family business in Zur in A Gift From Earth?",
        "Article": "By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first\nterrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in\ngas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business\nwas gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas\nat a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the\nbrothers Masur.\n  \n \n  The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an\nenergetic protest to the governor of Lor.\n  \n \n  At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen\nfor a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and\ndeparted from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of\nMasur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that\nmuch new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\n  \n \n  \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan\nblackly.\n  \n \n  In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio\nreceiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was\nloaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other\nradio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the\nnatural follow-up in its campaign of advertising\u2014radio programs\u2014with\ncommercials.\n  \n \n  Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or\nthey would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\n  \n \n  \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not\npaused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be\nmodern\u2014keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing\nall in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a\ngreat, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in\nten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they\nare even bringing\n   \n   autos\n   \n  to Zur!\"\n  \n \n  The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these\nhitherto unheard-of vehicles.\n  \n \n  \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the\nEarthmen are taking care of that.\"\n  \n \n  At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves\nthat they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses\nand street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new\nhighways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made\nyet.\n  \n<doc-sep>Zotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman,\nwon over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter\ninterest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth.\nThese, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.\n  \n \n  The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the\nEarthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.\n  \n \n  For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars about on the\nnew concrete highways the Earthmen had built. From pumps owned by a\nterrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from\nthe crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit.\nThe food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges,\nserved up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the\nwinter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though\nthey had gas-fired central heating.\n  \n \n  About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric\ngenerators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of\nelectrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason,\nbatteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to\nbuy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?\n  \n \n  The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan.\nThey had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric\nfans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could\npossibly sell them.\n  \n \n  \"We will be forty years paying it all off,\" exulted Zotul, \"but\nmeantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?\"\n  \n \n  But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option.\nThe Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The\nEarthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because\nit was so much more efficient\u2014and to lower prices, which was Earth's\nunswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded.\nBroderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.\n  \n \n  The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets\nwere delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and\nmaintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth\nhad them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth,\nbut to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.\n  \n \n  The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush\nbusiness.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  A Gift From Earth\n  \n \n  By MANLY BANISTER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by KOSSIN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction August 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Except for transportation, it was absolutely\n    \n   free ... but how much would the freight cost?\n   \n \n \n \n  \"It is an outrage,\" said Koltan of the House of Masur, \"that the\nEarthmen land among the Thorabians!\"\n  \n \n  Zotul, youngest of the Masur brothers, stirred uneasily. Personally, he\nwas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\n  \n \n  At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his\ndotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the\nPottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and\nhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers\u2014Koltan, eldest\nand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their\ntreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in\nthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\n  \n \n  \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are\nthese Earthmen to worry about?

The truth was that all on Zur were panting\nto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a\nvery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The House of Masur is a family business in Zur, run by Koltan and his six sons. The business specializes in pottery and clay manufacturing for Zur. The family gathers as they deliberate the upcoming arrival of Earthmen. Some of the brothers express frustration that the Earthmen will be landing among the Thorabians rather than in Zur, disrupting their plan to steal the precious, scarce metals off their ship. Zotul, the youngest of the brothers, discourages the plan, saying that the Earthmen's ship is their only way of transport. After the meeting, Zotul ponders what other benefits the Earthmen could serve. The Earthmen eventually arrive at Zur, parading the streets and making speeches, and leaving shortly after. They return with multiple ships and establish corporations all over Zur. One day, Zotul's wife brings home a metal pot, which she had bought from Earthmen; she tells him that they are high in demand and that a new type of stove is essential to use them. Zotul protests, but later designs a ceramic stove, which becomes a successful development in their business. Earthmen continue introducing more technology to Zur, including a printing press and telegraphs. Zotul notes internally that though the business has made profit, it is dependent upon the pots from Earth. The business quickly begins declining, with sales dropping. They attempt to advertise their business, but advertisement has become fully occupied by Earth. After ten years, during which Koltan has passed on, the Masur business has dwindled. The brothers decide to go to the governor of Lor, who tells them that the developments are all beneficial, informing them of a new production of highways. The brothers are optimistic that they would be able to use their clay for the roads, but Earthmen begin using cement. The governor then refers the brothers to Earth's Merchandising Council, where Zotul meets Kent Broderick, where he expresses sympathy about the status of the Masur business and offers them the luxuries brought by Earthmen, completely free except for the cost of freight. The cost, however, is more than the brothers could ever afford, and so Broderick sets them up with a credit system, as well as a contract for the family to supply Earthmen with ceramic parts. The brothers enjoy their luxury, but it is short lived, as their contract expires and they find themselves in debt. Zotul then revisits the governor, who ends up being Broderick. Broderick informs Zotul that Earth has bought them, and every business in Zur, out, and that they own everything. Broderick tells Zotul that the family will work for Earth now, and that Earth will fully conquer Zur. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is about a group of people on a planet called Zur. One day, they are visited by Earthmen who arrive in a ship made of valuable material. The Earthmen come with announcements that they only intend to provide the world of Zur with great things and that all will be well if the Zurian people cooperate. Soon, more Earthmen arrive on the planet. They land a ship in every city on Zur and begin trading basic items. When they trade, they take the Zurian version of their goods and destroy them. Zotul is forced to design new stoves for the new cookware. Zotul and his brothers are initially able to make a great profit selling their new ceramic stoves. \n\nThe Earthmen continue to bring new inventions that the Zurian population do not possess. They bring new communication devices like the printing press, then radios, and eventually television sets. Eventually, Zotul and his brother\u2019s operations are unable to compete with the Earthmen\u2019s goods. Their profits drop to abysmal levels in all of their industries. Zotul is told by his brothers to go make a formal complaint. He goes to the headquarters of the Merchandising Council where he meets Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council. Broderick acts very nice to Zotul and appears to only have good intentions. Broderick promises to help Zotul and offers to give him many luxurious gifts that Zotul states he cannot afford. Broderick explains to Zotul that is of no issue and he can offer him credit. After only explaining the good parts of credit to Zotul, Zotul goes and convinces his brothers to sign up for the credit system. In addition, Broderick gives them a contract to manufacture some goods for the Earthmen. However, the contract does not last long and the Earthmen build their own plant. As a result, the House of Masur is unable to keep up with its debts. Zotul\u2019s brothers express their anger and accuse Zotul of getting them into incredible poverty. In an effort to remedy the situation, Zotul goes to the Council House where he does not find Mr. Broderick but a man named Mr. Siwicki. Mr. Siwicki informs him that the Earthmen will repossess everything him and his brothers own if they do not pay their debts. Zotul\u2019s brothers are so stunned by the news that they do not even beat him. In a last-ditch effort, Zotul goes to the governor\u2019s palace for help. There he finds Broderick is now the governor. Broderick then informs Zotul that the Earthmen were slowly taking ownership of Zur away from the Zurian to then move in an attempt to peacefully take over the planet. The ultimate goal is to mix with the native population and then form a cohesive one. However, the Zurian caste system had to be first broken down. The story ends with Broderick asking if Zotul and his brothers are ready to willfully oblige to their assignments and Zotul replies yes. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\nKoltan of the House of Masur is furious that the Earthmen are coming to live amongst the Thorabians in the world of Zur while his brother, Zotul, is in favor of it. Kalrab Masur says that there is nothing to worry about because the Earthmen will eventually leave, but clay will go on forever. Morvan thinks that the Earthmen could have come to Lor, and Singula implies that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen. Zotul tries to explain that they cannot take the Earthmen\u2019s method of transport away from them, but the other brothers tell him to be quiet. The Earthmen arrive at Lor and are impressed with the city, and they communicate through interpreters. Some agreements between the Lorian government and the Earthmen are made. Although the anti-Earthmen Faction is happy that the Earthmen are gone, the visitors come back and establish corporations to engage in trade. When Zotul comes home, his wife Lania shows him an aluminum pot. She tells him that the Earthmen are selling these items cheap. She tells him that he will need to design a new ceramic stove for a dozen pots. He beats his wife but goes off to design the stove anyways; the Masurs begin to profit more than ever from the porcelain stoves. The Earthmen also bring other items such as the printing press, copper wire for telegraph lines, and plastic cutlery. The Masur family ceramics are slowly being replaced. Kalrab concludes that the items from Earth are the main reason.  The Earthmen begin to lay pipelines after the discovery of crude oil and natural gas. The Masur stove business is also gone after ten years; the brothers plan to protest to the governor of Lor. They see the Earthmen are building more structures, such as an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The brothers want to rely on their tile business, but the Earthmen have begun manufacturing Portland cement. The governor is in support of the Earthmen, and they go to speak to Kent Broderick, who is in charge of the Merchandising Council. Broderick tells him that he will give the expensive Earth items to Zotul for the payment of freight charges on items. Broderick offers credit to him and his brothers as part of the Easy Payment Plan. All of the brothers sign. The brothers slowly go into debt, and the Earthmen build plants that cost lower to manufacture materials. They tell Zotul to speak with Broderick again, but Mr. Siwicki speaks to him instead and says that the brothers will need to assign the remaining three-quarters of their pottery. Koltan tells Zotul to see the governor, but the person is revealed to be Broderick. He says that they have taken over everything on Zur because Earth is too overcrowded. The future population will be a mixture of Zurians and Earthmen; he tells Zotul that he will have his job back but work for the Earthmen. Broderick then hands assignment papers for him and his brothers to sign. ",
        "Summary_4": "The House of Masur owns a prosperous family business of pottery and consists of six brothers, each having their position in business according to their rank of age. The Earthmen come to the world of Zur, which enrages some members of the family. The younger brother, Zotul, is sympathetic to the Eartmen, but the youngest can\u2019t speak up and he gets beaten. The Earthmen parade through Zur, proclaiming the intention to do great things and asking for cooperation. After a while, many more ships come from Earth to every Zurian city to establish \"corporations\" for trade. Zotul's wife buys a set of cheap aluminum pots at the market, which are being bought by all the housewives as they are better than those from clay. New pots require completely different stoves and Zotul has to design such. Koltan, the elder brother, puts the model into production as the demand is high. The Masurs flourish with the new business and depend on the metal pots from Earth, as the production of their own falls. The Earthmen keep introducing new things like telegraph lines and printing presses. The Earthmen find a great deal of metals, crude oil and natural gas, and sell it to the Zurians themselves. Further introduction of plastic utensils undermines the Masur's business completely. They head to the governor, who talks about the benefits of new culture and upcoming autos and highways. The Earthmen introduce cement and the hopes for tile business go down as well. The complaints are redirected to the Merchandising Council set by the Earthmen, where Zotul is met by Broderick. The man is sympathetic to the brothers\u2019 poverty, but he can only grant Zotul a gas range, a gas-fired furnace and a car, a luxury only a few can afford and everyone envies. The goal of the Earthmen is to spread technology through the galaxy, so Broderick only asks Zotul to pay for the freight, which is a huge sum, and, therefore, can only be in credit for the family. Enchanted Zotul takes the credit papers for all his brothers to sign to get the same goods. Broderick also gives a contract for making ceramic parts for the cars, which will help the brothers pay off the credit. After signing the papers, the brothers enjoy the luxuries and receive one fourth of the ceramic profits. In three years the Earthmen cancel the contract, the family is poor and Zotul is forced to visit the council again as the Masurs can't pay. A new man threatens him with the court and asks to assign the rest of the business to the Earthmen. Zotul heads to the governor for support, but finds Broderick on his place, who tells the Masur's business is the last to be bought off. Earth is overcrowded, so the new planets are required to take over. Instead of painful wars, the Earthmen buy off other nations to work for them until both nations are equal and mixed. "

        "Query": "What is the treatment of Zotul by his brothers in the story \"A Gift From Earth\"?",
        "Article": "Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his\nown counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough\nfor him. He would report when the time was ripe.\n  \n \n  \"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference\nwas expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his\nelders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building\nthat ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means\nof transport.\"\n  \n \n  Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret\nconclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it.\nThe speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.\n  \n \n  \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,\nremember your position in the family.\"\n  \n \n  Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his\nhead than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of\nthe clay.\"\n  \n \n  Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him\na beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough\nthing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in\ntheir desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they\ndid.\n  \n \n  Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought\nabout the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way\nof metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could\nfigure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of\nhis brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of\ncourse, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.\n  \n<doc-sep>All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this\noccasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.\n  \n \n  Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been\nmade upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in\nthe world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab\nMasur\u2014Divinity protect him\u2014departed this life to collect his greater\nreward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and\nbones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone\nis the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and\nall because of new things coming from Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come\nto me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has,\nwe're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth\u2014always to\ndo right by the customer.\"\n  \n \n  \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for\ndamages.\"\n  \n \n  Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense\nfortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your\ntrouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do\nyou own an automobile?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"\n  \n \n  Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes\nthe music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"\n  \n \n  Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the\nbargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.\n  \n \n  \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these\nluxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off\nwith a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car\nfrom the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered\nand installed in your home.\"\n  \n \n  \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" beamed the Earthman cheerily. \"Every item is given to\nyou absolutely free\u2014a gift from the people of Earth. All we ask is\nthat you pay the freight charges on the items. Our purpose is not to\nmake profit, but to spread technology and prosperity throughout the\nGalaxy. We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out\nthe full program takes time.\"\n  \n \n  He chuckled deeply. \"We of Earth have a saying about one of our\nextremely slow-moving native animals. We say, 'Slow is the tortoise,\nbut sure.' And so with us. Our goal is a long-range one, with the\nmotto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'\"\n  \n<doc-sep>For the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade\nand a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this\nbackward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was\nslow, but it was extremely sure.\n  \n \n  The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less\nmoney and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television\nkept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the\npangs of impoverishment.\n  \n \n  The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul\ndesigned and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons\nwere a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold\nthem for less.\n  \n \n  The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any\nmore, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.\n  \n \n  \"You got us into this,\" they said, emphasizing their bitterness with\nfists. \"Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some\ncontracts to continue operating.\"\n  \n \n  Nursing bruises, Zotul unhappily went to the Council House again. Mr.\nBroderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him.\nWould he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.\n  \n \n  Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint\nof toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.\n  \n \n  \"So you can't pay,\" he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He\nlooked at Zotul coldly. \"It is well you have come to us instead of\nmaking it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Zotul.\n  \n \n  \"If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything\nattached to them. That means you would lose your houses, for they are\nattached to the furnaces. However, it is not as bad as that\u2014yet. We\nwill only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your\npottery to us.\"\n  \n \n  The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of\nbeating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was\nsomewhat comforted.\n  \n \n  \"To fail,\" said Koltan soberly, \"is not a Masur attribute. Go to the\ngovernor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of\nMasur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is\ntime for the government to do something for us.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Each of the six brothers of the Masur business has their own specialty; a director, treasurer, vice-chief, sales manager, export chief, and Zotul, their designer. Despite their equal roles in the business, Zotul is the youngest brother, and for this reason is mistreated. In meetings and conferences, he is rarely allowed to speak without being scolded, and his input is never taken seriously. Zotul also experiences beatings by his brothers regularly. Even though Zotul experiences this treatment, the brothers still expect him to carry the weight of responsibilities for them, such as meeting with Broderick.",
        "Summary_2": "Zotul and his 5 brothers have a hierarchal type of relationship. It does appear to be a loving nor welcoming familial relationship. Zotul is the youngest of his brothers and as tradition is expected to not talk unless spoken to and to enthusiastically agree with the decisions of his elders. Whenever Zotul does break these social traditions, he is physically beaten by his brothers. Zotul does not like the beatings but accepts them as another reality of his life. ",
        "Summary_3": "Zotul and his brothers have a rocky relationship. Whenever the brothers are frustrated or upset, they beat him. They also tell him to stop speaking when his opinion is not needed. When it comes to business, however, the brothers get along. Koltan and Zotul work together to put the new ceramic stove into production. The brothers are also happy when Zotul brings them the papers to sign from Broderick, and they all enjoy the luxuries of the Easy Payment Plan. Whenever there is a problem, such as being unable to meet Payments, they will blame it all on Zotul and tell him to go deal with the problem. ",
        "Summary_4": "The family is organized in a way of hierarchy, where age gives power. All of the brothers have positions and shares in business, also according to the age. As Zotul is the youngest, he has the least rank and importance. During the meetings he is supposed to listen with admiration to the eldest. He can't share his thoughts when he is not asked to. Otherwise, he is beaten badly, which scares him. He is also given all the orders and is used as a negotiator. He does all the time-consuming tasks like to complain. "

Personally, he\nwas in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.\n  \n \n  At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his\ndotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the\nPottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and\nhe knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers\u2014Koltan, eldest\nand Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their\ntreasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in\nthe rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.\n  \n \n  \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are\nthese Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength\nand our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade.

The truth was that all on Zur were panting\nto get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a\nvery scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place in Zur, a region within Lor, on a foreign planet. There is a neighboring region, Thorabia, often seen as a rival. Zur is initially a mellow city, made of clay and tile. However, once Earth begins overtaking Zur, the city becomes more crowded and filled with large, corporate buildings, made of cement and metal. Much of the story occurs within the office of the Masur family business, as well as the governor's building, and the office of the Merchandising Council.",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place on the world of Zur. On Zur, there are many different cities. At the beginning of the story, the House of Masur brothers and their father are sitting around a table discussing the Earthmen and their valuable ship. The city that the House of Masur resides in is known as Lor. The primary setting of the story is different locations or cities on the world of Zur. The Earthmen that visit take trips from Earth on their ships through space and reach Zur after multiple light-years of travel. The story happens over the course of ten place years. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on the planet of Zur. The brothers live in the city of Lor, while one of their rival cities is Thorabia. The buildings in the city are all made of tile, and the ground is paved with tile too. Many of the appliances used by the citizens are made out of ceramic. When the Earthmen come, they fly in strange metal contraptions. Ten years later, one area of the city has been turned into a spaceport for Earthmen. There are also new plants opening up for radio receiving sets and cement. Pipelines are also added, connecting every major and minor area on the planet. The governor\u2019s palace is located in the city as well. Eventually, all of the tiles are replaced with concrete because it is cheaper. Old buildings are torn down to make room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on the planet of Zur, especially a city called Lor. It begins at the long, shining table of the Masur family. The family is wealthy and their pottery business is prosperous. The whole planet is uncivilized and lives in a hierarchical system. Soon a large metal ship comes from Earth and parades through the city, which stuns the local people. Many more ships come soon and step by step introduce the new technologies. At first, the markets are overflowed by aluminum pots, bought by every housewife. One of those appears in Zotul's house, and he designs a new stove for it, which is soon produced by the family business. Newspapers appear in every house, then telegraphs, radio, autos and ,any other things. The city gets urbanized and the people become poor as they try to obtain all the new technologies. Concrete houses are built, gas and metals are found. Soon the Earthmen buy off all the businesses and the planet starts reminding Earth."

        "Query": "How did the Earthmen successfully expand their influence over Zur in the story \"A Gift From Earth\"?",
        "Article": "By and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange\nmetal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the\ncity, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of\ntile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the\npeople to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much\ntoo quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to\nbe desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident.\n  \n \n  The Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of\nZur. It required but the cooperation\u2014an excellent word, that\u2014of all\nZurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in\neffect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered,\nfor it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a\nwhaling for it.\n  \n \n  There was also some talk going around about agreements made between\nthe Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one\nthing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a\nnewspaper, was unknown on Zur.\n  \n \n  Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously,\nnone had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had\ntried. The anti-Earthmen Faction\u2014in any culture complex, there is\nalways an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor\u2014crowed\nhappily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.\n  \n \n  Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships\narrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was\npractically acrawl with Earthmen.\n  \n \n  Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called\n\"corporations\"\u2014Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The\nobject of the visit was trade.\n  \n \n  In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian\ncity of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took\nsome time for the news to spread.\n  \n \n  The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the\npottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an\naluminum pot at him.\n  \n \n  \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.\n  \n \n  \"A pot. I bought it at the market.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my\nsubstance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I\nsay!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first\nterrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in\ngas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business\nwas gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas\nat a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the\nbrothers Masur.\n  \n \n  The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an\nenergetic protest to the governor of Lor.\n  \n \n  At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen\nfor a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and\ndeparted from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of\nMasur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that\nmuch new building was taking place and wondered what it was.\n  \n \n  \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan\nblackly.\n  \n \n  In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio\nreceiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was\nloaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other\nradio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the\nnatural follow-up in its campaign of advertising\u2014radio programs\u2014with\ncommercials.\n  \n \n  Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or\nthey would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.\n  \n \n  \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not\npaused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be\nmodern\u2014keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing\nall in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a\ngreat, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in\nten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they\nare even bringing\n   \n   autos\n   \n  to Zur!\"\n  \n \n  The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these\nhitherto unheard-of vehicles.\n  \n \n  \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the\nEarthmen are taking care of that.\"\n  \n \n  At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves\nthat they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses\nand street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new\nhighways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made\nyet.\n  \n<doc-sep>The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of\nconfusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for\nan interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It\nwas remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female\nterrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men\ncovetous and Zurian women envious.\n  \n \n  \"The governor will see you,\" she said sweetly. \"He has been expecting\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me?\" marveled Zotul.\n  \n \n  She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor\nof Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a\nfriendly smile.\n  \n \n  \"Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.\"\n  \n \n  Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick,\nthe Earthman.\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I came to see the governor,\" he said in confusion.\n  \n \n  Broderick nodded agreeably. \"I am the governor and I am well acquainted\nwith your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand. The Earthmen....\" Zotul paused, coloring. \"We are\nabout to lose our plant.\"\n  \n \n  \"You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away\nfrom you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and\nrichest on Zur, it has taken a long time\u2014the longest of all, in fact.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yours is the last business on Zur to be taken over by us. We have\nbought you out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our government....\"\n  \n \n  \"Your governments belong to us, too,\" said Broderick. \"When they could\nnot pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took\nthem over, just as we are taking you over.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean,\" exclaimed Zotul, aghast, \"that you Earthmen own everything\non Zur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Even your armies.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   why\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Earthmen first visit Zur as a small group, exploring the city and giving speeches declaring future prosperity for Zur. They return shortly after with more people, and establish corporations and a trade business. The Earthmen begin with small products, metal pots, but other businesses soon have to accommodate to Earth's goods. Earth quickly earns profit, with many Zurian businesses dependent on their production. They begin establishing more advanced forms of technology, such as printing, radio, and automobiles. The people of Zur are fascinated, and business booms even more. Eventually, Zur is completely remodeled with Earth products and services, driving other businesses to failure and resulting in the overtaking of the city.",
        "Summary_2": "The Earthmen start by establishing small trading visits with the Zurian people. Once they have gained their trust in trade, they heavily accelerate the number of goods they trade. They establish themselves in every city on Zur to increase their visibility. They bring new communication methods such as the printing press, newspapers, radios, and television sets \u2013 all of which they control the supply. They build projects on the planet of Zur, like highways. They start their own manufacturing operations, successfully competing against and outpricing the native Zurian manufacturing operations. In addition, they lure the populace to be tempted by the new shiny luxury goods they bring and convince the Zurians to sign contracts that put them in debt that they can never realistically pay. They slowly but assuredly took over all of the industries on Zur so that they would have full economic control of the populace. Then they take over the leadership positions on the planet in another angle to obtain full control. The methods of the Earthmen is to ensure that the Zurians are either in debt to them, under their control, or how to work for them to survive. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Earthmen are able to expand to Zur through advertising and selling their products. After signing some agreements, the Earthmen begin importing their materials to Zur. The Earthmen begin bringing products such as aluminum pots, but they eventually move onto even grander things such as the printing press. The purpose of this is to not only spread knowledge but also provide more means of advertising for their products. Eventually, they begin to set up radio stations to broadcast their products even more. Gas-fired ranges, furnaces, heaters, and later cars all drive many of the old ways of Zurian life to the ground. Broderick even tells Zotul that their goal is to buy out all of the companies and eventually become the ruling government on Zur. ",
        "Summary_4": "From the beginning, the Earthmen put themselves as friendly mentors, willing to share their knowledge. The newly introduced goods are cheap and much better than the old ones. It disposes the Zurians towards the kind newcomers. The newspapers and telegraphs are free and gain popularity, while they advertise Earth goods all through the planet. As the time goes by, the Earthmen bring in more expensive and advanced technologies like autos, TVs, radios. People become dependent on those technologies, and as they break, they need to buy the new ones, everyone dreams of luxury cars, etc. At the same time the local businesses fail and poverty approaches. To be able to buy the new technologies, the Zurians get credits and work for the Earthmen to pay them off. Then the contracts are cancelled and the people have to sell their businesses. Therefore, the Earthmen gain control over the whole planet. "

        "Article": "All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this\noccasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.\n  \n \n  Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been\nmade upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in\nthe world of Zur.

This works out really well for the House of Masur until the Earthmen eventually build their own facility and manufacture the same product but in a cheaper manner, undercutting all profits the House of Masur could make. Even further, Broderick gets Zotul and his brothers to voluntarily go into debt so that they could own the luxurious items that the Earthmen were bringing to Zur.

They just fell into an exactly straight line,\nthe adjacent ones touching.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\"\n  \n \n  \"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that\nthere are two great apparently opposite principles governing the\nUniverse\u2014random and design.

It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;\nit's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other\nhand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes\nagainst it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental\nmanifestation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is\ncontrolling the coins and\u2014the other things?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Nagurski brought out a pipe.

Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no\nlonger a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less\nhuman nature.

        "Summary_1": "John Kevin catches up with Doc, who has grabbed a human by the throat. He tells the human that man will reach the moon tonight, and the man agrees, so Doc will let him go. Kevin apologizes to the human and says that his father has trouble differentiating old events. They see Martian tourists approaching the corner, and Kevin recalls how he hates Martian tourists because they are aliens. The two go to a flophouse, where Kevin bargains with the clerk over the price of a room. He threatens the human but stops when he hears Doc mumbling. They go to the room, and he lays Doc out on the cot. Doc begins to mumble more, while Kevin begins to copy down the words in his notebook again. Kevin knows that what Doc is mumbling will make him the most powerful man in the Solar Federation, especially because Doc was once somebody extremely important. Doc then begins to cry, and Kevin decides to comfort him slightly. Kevin then meets a woman by the bus stop and asks her for a dime for coffee. He realizes that she is a human tourist and recalls how he hates tourists. She offers to buy him dinner too, and they go to get a coffee. Kevin is revealed to be a caffeine addict, and he tells the woman that he wants a hamburger. One hamburger becomes several, and he drinks a glass of milk. Kevin asks the woman for a few to take home, and she introduces herself as Miss Vivian Casey. Kevin tells her his name too, and she hands him a coupon from a magazine. When he comes back to his senses, the counterman is pulling a five-dollar bill from under his hand. When he goes back, Doc has made something. It is revealed that Kevin has been trying to get time travel from Doc for the past few months and sees a condemned snowbird. The two thin and heavy men talk to him, asking him to tell them where he came from. The doctor explains his condition and hands him a manuscript, and Kevin steps into the range of Miss Casey\u2019s gun in real life. He asks her for coffee again, and she re-introduces herself as a North American Mounted Police member. She explains that Doc wanted to profit off of his time travel, but he did not have money. He wrestles the gun from her; suddenly, a Martian by the name of Andre appears. Andre makes Kevin realize that he is not a Centurian humanoid because he is the son of Doc. Kevin destroys the thing that Doc creates because he knows nobody is ready for time travel to be rediscovered. Miss Casey and Andre are relieved, while Kevin ponders why he destroyed the machine. He thinks it may be because of emotions or roast coffee. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in the world of intergalactic life and tells us about Kevin, a poor Centurian humanoid, and Doc, a person whose real name and significance Kevin forgot, but still remembers him as someone somewhat important to him in the past and roams with him around North America. Kevin pulls Doc away from an unfamiliar man whose collar he grabbed and carefully walks him to a flophouse. He pays for the room after a small conflict with the clerk. Once inside, Kevin falls down from muscle pain and Doc starts mumbling something that Kevin subconsciously remembers to be of utter importance. After writing down everything he heard from the old man, Kevin leaves in a search for coffee. A woman on the street agrees to pay for his drink and food despite Kevin\u2019s impoverished appearance -  we learn that he has a caffeine addiction that presents in a way more profound and serious way in Centurian men than in earthmen. She introduces herself as Vivian Casey and asks for a favor in return, handing him what seems to be a magazine coupon with some strange content. Suddenly Kevin becomes disoriented, Vivian disappears, leaving the money for the food in his fist. He pays for the bill, ordering some more to take with him, and comes back to Doc who has managed to create some strangely looking device from a bulb, a pen, and the bed carcass while Kevin was away. After kneeling beside Doc while the old man is murmuring something Kevin soon realizes that he is in a Victorian living room. He finally remembers that time travel was the reason why he considered Doc important. He meets two men that seem to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson. They briefly talk about time travel and after the doctor gives him his manuscript  Kevin finally goes back to his time only to find Miss Casey\u2019s gun pointed at him. She turns out to be a constable and tells Kevin that Doc found a way to travel in time and decided to make money by getting rare books in the past, but apparently started bringing works that had never existed. Kevin throws coffee at Casey, disarming her, but instantly sees a Martian at his door. Andre, as he introduced himself, continues the story Casey started and claims that hundreds of people disappeared after receiving Doc\u2019s books, but what\u2019s even more important, these books, which never existed, can help humans reach a state of pure logic. During their conversation, Andre also helps Kevin remember that Doc is his father and Kevin himself is actually an earthman not a Centurian. Overwhelmed, Kevin quickly decides to break the time travel device and, thus, lose this knowledge for many years because he\u2019s certain that neither Martians nor earthmen are truly ready for time travel.",
        "Summary_3": "The story introduces an initially unnamed protagonist, who accompanies a fellow named \u201cDoc\u201d, both of whom are men but not Earthmen, hence Centurians. Doc is first introduced as choking a human man, seemingly in a trance and talking about a man reaching the moon. The protagonist carefully removes the human from Doc\u2019s hold and asks for forgiveness, claiming memory issues, and the pair move on to a cheap motel. While arguing for the cost of their stay, the clerk finds out that the protagonist had cheapened him despite having a quarter, and keeps the remaining nickel. \n\nThere, the protagonist lays Doc on the bed in the dirty room and as he begins to mumble, the protagonist begins to take notes amidst his own cramps and feelings of dirtiness. He soon remembers that the Doc holds the information to become a powerful man. However, his own pain wins out and the protagonist stumbles out of the room and encounters a clean, young woman, hoping to beg for a cup of coffee and she does, but only as she accompanies him in drinking coffee and eating several hamburgers. Introducing herself as Miss Vivian Casey and himself as John Kevin - the protagonist finally realizing his name - Casey presents Kevin with a coupon clipping from a magazine detailing a request for \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. As he reads it however, Kevin finds himself disoriented and the young woman gone. Kevin heads back to the room and finds that Doc has created an unnamed thing, which he finds trouble understanding its meaning. \n\nKevin suddenly finds himself in a Victorian living room with a man he labels as a snowbird, the latter who probes Kevin to reveal what time and place he has come from. Surprised, Kevin realizes that the information he was trying to get from Doc was time travel, and this Victorian snowbird had come to this conclusion as well. Through a length of discourse, Kevin describes what he knows about various Earth theories like yoga and relativity. Afterwards, he asks the doctor a question about his first manuscript and accepts the papers before finding himself back in the original timeline of this story, looking straight into Casey\u2019s gun. \n\nMiss Casey turns out to be a policewoman, who after being handed the manuscript papers, reveals to Kevin that Doc has indeed figured out a method for time travel by obtaining rare editions of literature and books that did not exist for his clients. Aided by a Martian named Andre, it is revealed that hundreds of people have disappeared after receiving a book from the Doc and that Kevin was actually Doc\u2019s son - and human. A dispute soon occurs between the three ending with Kevin destroying the time machine, hoping that the future rediscovery of time travel will be accompanied by the world\u2019s readiness for it. In his ending thoughts - Kevin debates why he did that - for the human race\u2019s purpose, or for the production of coffee. \n",
        "Summary_4": "When John Kevin caught up with Doc, a man was grabbing the collar of Doc. He took Doc from the man and walked him to a flophouse. When he got them a room to stay in, he tried to save some money from the only quarter. He needed that money to get something caffeinated after taking care of Doc. However, he failed, and the clerk took the money in the flophouse. After he recorded some notes for Doc\u2019s mumbling, he went out to get food. He begged for a woman on the street for money, but the woman would only buy him food after watching him eat. He gulped some hamburgers and coffee when the woman watched him eat, bought some food after the women had left, and left for the flophouse to feed the Doc. John Kevin has trouble finding the memory of himself because of the side effects of time travel. He mistook himself as Kevin O\u2019Malley, which is Doc\u2019s name. He also mistakenly considered himself a Centurian, who regarded drinking coffee as a vice, when he was an Earthman. When the woman asked for his name, he introduced himself as Kevin because he thought Kevin O\u2019Malley was his name. When John Kevin went back to the room, he saw Doc had made a thing by using the materials in the room.\n\nHe time-traveled to the Victorian era, where he saw two men sitting on chairs and chatting. During his stay in that era, he realized what he had been trying to know from Doc was time travel. He also realized that the man he talked to within the room, who he mistook as a snowbird, is Doc. After talking to the men, he received the first manuscript from them and returned to his own time, where he reencountered the woman, whose gun pointed at him. She revealed herself as a constable from the police, trying to tell Kevin the truth. But he rivaled against her. Then a Martian came, trying to do the same thing as the woman. From their saying, John Kevin realized his true identity as Doc\u2019s son and knew the consequences of Doc\u2019s use of time travel. Once he understood the situation, he destroyed the time machine because he didn\u2019t want to live in a pure logical state, which is the outcome of using time travel to make fantasy reality.\n"

        "Summary_1": "Vivian Casey is described as a pink and clean woman who smells of clean soap. Her hair is platinum, pulled straight back to draw her cheek-bones tighter. She has an appealing mouth; Kevin also notes that her body is lean, athletic, and feminine. She also wears a powder-blue dress that goes down to the lower-half of her legs. She speaks in an educated voice and is kind enough to take Kevin to get some food. Although he is annoyed she decided to tag along, she lets him order multiple hamburgers to satisfy his hunger. When she introduces herself, he assumes that she is a schoolteacher. Kevin later realizes that she did not pay for his dinner at all. Miss Casey then comes back with a tiny gun. She is shown to be proficient with the firearm, introducing her true identity as a Constable of the North American Mounted Police. She is also very intelligent, being fully aware of what Doc has tried to do in the past. Although she uses force to judo hold Kevin, she doesn\u2019t put her heart into it. Finally, she is shown to be proud of Kevin when he does the right thing and destroys the time machine. ",
        "Summary_2": "Vivian Casey is a decently looking woman who agrees to pay for the drink and food of Kevin, a poor Centurian man who has been wandering around North America with Doc, someone who Kevin believes to be important to him. After Kevin uses the time travel device, that Doc has made while Kevin was away, and finally comes back from the Victorian era, Vivian waits for him with a gun and introduces herself as a constable of North American mounted Police. Apparently, she has been following Kevin and Doc, his father who found a method of time travel,  for a while and even got closer to him by pretending to be an innocent bystander when he was hungry and suffering withdrawal effects in the beginning of the story. When Kevin destroys the device she cries and admits that she\u2019s glad he did that. Vivian seems to be a good constable who can understand people well, but she\u2019s also sincere enough to accept her view on things. ",

She is approached by Kevin as he begs for a small amount of change to use to buy coffee. His request will only be fulfilled if she accompanies him, so Kevin reluctantly follows her as she buys him coffee and hamburgers. She is heavily emphasized as being clean and introduces herself to Kevin as Miss Vivian Casey with a bright smile. After providing him with food and drink, Casey requests a small favor from Kevin and presents him with a coupon clipping from a magazine that details a request for \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. \n\nWe see Miss Casey again as the protagonist reappears in front of her tiny gun, where it is revealed that she is not a schoolteacher nor a tourist but rather a North American Mounted Police. Her interaction with Kevin was intentional, as she had been tracking him and the Doc in order to stop the latter\u2019s method of time travel. She plays a key role in helping Kevin unravel the truth about his identity and what the Doc was doing. In the scuffle to keep the time machine out of the hands of the Martians, she grabs Kevin in a judo hold which he quickly breaks and then  destroys the machine. She is seen at the end of the story crying into Kevin\u2019s chest, relieved at its destruction. \n",

Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of\nDoc's character. He was a scholar.\"\n  \n \n  Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared\nme. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I\nneeded some coffee.\n  \n \n  \"He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines\nfor his clients in absolutely mint condition.

Maybe you\ncan't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums\nbefore Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time\ntravel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we\nweren't now.\n  \n \n  Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't\nmind her touching me.\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?\n  \n \n  I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed\n   \n   it\n   \n  because I didn't\nwant the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose,\ndirection or love, but I would never know for sure.

I hated him. Because I\ncouldn't trust to my own senses as he did.\n  \n \n  \"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional\ncreations.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit\nfor the addition of professional polish to my works.\"\n  \n \n  The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that\nlooked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor\nwould tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory\nand practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better\nequipped to judge whether we exist.\"\n  \n \n  There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had\never heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception\nto Relativity and the positron and negatron.\n  \n \n  \"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke.\n\"Presume that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory\nPerception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be.\nThe great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we\nknow them. The great literary creations assume reality.\"\n  \n \n  I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be\nthe goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed\nredhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the\ndetective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of\nunknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.\n  \n \n  His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal\nsymptoms.\"\n  \n \n  The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building\nup behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He\nwas not\n   \n   really\n   \n  a snowbird.\n  \n \n  After a time, I asked the doctor a question.\n  \n \n  \"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my\nprofessional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great\nand good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened.\nMy heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote\nin sunlight and stepped toward it....\n  \n \n  ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Doc\u2019s use of time travel has caused hundreds of people to disappear from North America a few months ago. He initially starts off using time travel to get rare editions of books and magazines in mint condition. However, he derails and starts getting books that do not exist. For many of his clients, they shortly ceased to exist after obtaining a book from Doc. Doc also had bought the entire stock of an ancient metaphysical order, which he then supplied to his clients. Books such as the Book of Dyzan, Book of Thoth, Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan, and the Necromican were given away even if they do not exist in the present-day. These books are extremely harmful because they essentially instruct the human race on how to achieve a state of pure logic without requiring food, sex, or conflict. ",
        "Summary_2": "After finding a method to travel in time Doc, an earthly scholar, decided to make money by bringing rare book editions from different times to his clients. But once he started bringing books that have never existed his clients disappeared soon after receiving them - at least several hundred people in North America ceased to exist after getting their order from Doc. Furthermore, time traveling allowed the \u201cunconscious racial mind\u201d to construct new worlds and realities by creating new books that were able to teach humans how to reach the state of pure logic and therefore deprive them of all humanly characteristics. ",
        "Summary_3": "Doc\u2019s use of time travel has caused hundreds of people to disappear from North America - as if they ceased to exist. This occurred shortly after Doc gave them a book - books that were collected in metaphysical order and distributed to his liking. As a result, the interplay of time travel and bringing books and their knowledge in and out of existence has caused them to ultimately not exist, but still influence the unconscious mind into creating them. As such, it is revealed that the human mind has been able to understand and access the powers of ESP, telekinesis, etc as well as achieve states of pure logic and thought. Both immediate consequences, like the erasure of people\u2019s existence, as well as existential consequences like the potential for the power of human minds to be accessed occurred because of his time travel. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Time travel allows the unconscious racial mind, a mind that knows the power of extrasensory perception, to go back in time and create books that do not exist before. These books allow the human race to teach itself how to turn the material body with desires into a pure logic state without the body, where they don\u2019t need sex, food, or any material supply. Therefore, when Doc uses time travel to create those books and distribute them to people, people who received the books from Doc disappear. Their material existence vanishes. And Doc himself also reaches the state of pure logic, where his material existence disappears."

He had to get out\u2014away from\nthem. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between\ntheir world and his.\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool\nof scummy water.\n  \n \n  They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the\nCity Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of\nsome kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest\u2014and then crawled\ncrab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n  \n \n  He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he\nshuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the\nCity Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of\nthe building and halting for a moment before going on.\n  \n \n  Were there more of them?\n  \n \n  It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm\nweren't men. They were alien\u2014from some other world, some other\ndimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the\nuniverse. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm\nof being.\n  \n \n  On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved\ntoward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter\nthe City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n  \n \n  Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight,\nclutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly\nfluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and\ncame to rest among them.\n  \n \n  Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves\nas men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration.\nMimicry.\n  \n \n  Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The\nalley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe\ndarkness made no difference to them.\n  \n \n  He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and\nwomen flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting\ngroups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the\nevening gloom.\n  \n \n  Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the\nbus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A\nmoment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "This story follows the life of Martin from a young boy living in a rough neighborhood to an old man dying aboard an unmanned ship. We first see Martin following the disappearance of his mother - and lack of a father - which are commonplace in the neighborhood he grows up in where the kids rarely attend school and their living conditions are poor. Martin is taken in by a young woman, Ninian, who instructs him to call her Aunt Ninian despite being identified as his future descendant. Ninian has traveled back in time to her great-great-grandfather - Martin - in order to protect him from his future son Conrad. Conrad, described as an idealist, is dismayed by the future generations exploitation of Earth and destructive social order that casts out anyone and everything that doesn't encompass the privileged and elite. To correct the wrongdoings of the future, Conrad plans to kill Martin. The rest of Conrad\u2019s cousins intercept this plan and instead, all decide to travel into the past to accompany Martin and protect him from an assassination attempt. \n\nMartin\u2019s formative years are accompanied by Ninian, Raymond and Ives where he picks up art as a career, forms impersonal relationships with his descendants and learns more about the past and future quality of life. As years pass with no threat of Conrad in sight, Martin begins to explore his world alongside Ives on a yacht named The Interregnum. Soon though, the cousins that come and go begin to blur together and Martin picks up a detached view of the world as his interest wanes in his sheltered life. Martin lives to a very old age, and on his deathbed aboard the yacht, he is surrounded by all his descendants besides Ives, who passed of sickness earlier before. It is at this moment that Conrad appears, seemingly to finish his murder plot. However, it is revealed that no action was required to be taken by Conrad, as his fellow cousins have already achieved the mission of erasing their lineage. By containing Martin to a sheltered life, the cousins prevented Martin from living his normal life with a wife and kids, thus removing the possibility of their existence in the past, present and future. Furthermore, it is revealed that Martin had come to the same conclusion years ago, and chose instead to keep quiet out of his disdain for his descendants. With the cousins horrified at the knowledge, Conrad reassures Martin that their inaction resulted in hope, and Martin ponders to wonder if the assurance was genuine as he peacefully dies alone on the boat. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin\u2019s mother disappears, but nobody is surprised because mothers usually disappear around these parts. Ninian comes to take care of him, and he has no father because he was born as a war baby. Martin thinks that the story about Ninian being from the future is a gag, and he likes to bait her because she ends up crying. Ninian, however, tells him that she is protecting him from her cousin Conrad who is coming to kill him in the future. His living conditions have improved, but Martin misses his old neighborhood where he could play with the other children. Ninian and her relatives only take care of him as if it is some unpleasant duty; he learns that nobody works with hands anymore in their world because it is all done by machinery. When Martin turns sixteen, Raymond tells him about Conrad and his idealist ideas of making living fairer for the exploited natives on other planets. Conrad blames his great-grandfather for discovering the super drive. Conrad then bribes one of Professor Farka\u2019s assistants to reveal information about a time transmitter, and he plans to go back in time to eliminate the common ancestor. Raymond explains that they got plans from another assistant and a handicrafts enthusiast to build another gadget. They could guard over Martin day and night so Conrad could not attack. Raymond explains that Ninian is leaving, and Martin feels oddly desolate because of their time together. When she leaves, Ninian cries at her inadequacy; Martin and Raymond move to a luxurious mansion in a remote area that protects them from the Second Atomic War. The relatives come back to hold meetings; Martin thinks he wants to be a physicist or engineer, but the relatives insist that he should be a painter. Ives eventually takes over and displays his art in a museum, and he buys a yacht called The Interregnum to go traveling. He lives out the rest of his days on the yacht with the other descendants, but he does not care for them much. Ives explains that the future world is not that much better, and he isn\u2019t even sure if Conrad is wrong. Ives, however, ends up dying from a chill. Eventually, Martin\u2019s work is bought by a museum in Italy; he asks one cousin where Conrad is. He lies dying at one hundred and four as the relatives all come to visit. Conrad comes to visit too, and he explains to the other cousins that they will all disappear because Martin was never allowed to lead a normal life. After realizing that the other man knew all along, Raymond calls Martin a criminal, but Martin does not mind. Conrad tells him that their plan will benefit the future, but Martin is not sure if he is telling the truth or not. As Martin dies, he is the only one left on the ship because everybody else has disappeared. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story describes the life of Martin, a young kid whose mother dies. When this happens, a new woman begins to take care of him. She, called Ninian, tells Martin that she comes from the future, and is there to take care of him. Throughout this, Martin doesn\u2019t question the motives of his caretaker. Later, it is also revealed that she is a descendant of Martin. More and more descendants of Martin come to his time in order to take care of him, taking turns of about 5 years in doing so, and are referred to as cousins. One of the cousins also reveals that the reason that they are protecting him is because one of their cousins wants to kill him. This is because one of Martin\u2019s descendants created a piece of equipment that allowed humans to travel through space, leading to humans taking advantage of native species of other planets for their own economic benefit. Conrad, the descendant who wanted to kill him, wants to stop humans from ever traveling through space. Martin continues this boring life, preparing for the eventual arrival of Conrad who wants to kill him. Throughout his boring and repetitive life, Martin begins to question the actions of his descendants. When eventually Martin is an old man and is going to die, all of his descendants get together to say goodbye. This is where Conrad finally made an appearance, and it is revealed that everything was part of Conrad\u2019s plan, as living his repetitive life Martin never had the chance to have children, therefore stopping his descendant from inventing the equipment necessary for human space travel. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story tells about the life of a boy called Martin. At the beginning, he lives in a poor neighborhood with his mother, who disappears one day. Instead, he is now looked after by Ninian, who claims to be Martin\u2019s descendant from the future who came here to protect him from Conrad - Ninian\u2019s cousin. She hires private tutors for him and soon decides to move to a better neighborhood and live in a big well-furnished house. Occasionally, the other descendants, like Ives or Raymond, also visit them and talk about the future where almost nobody works, and everything is done by machinery. Martin turns sixteen when Raymond finally tells him the full story: Raymond's brother Conrad was disappointed by the fact that the humans of his time exploited the other life forms on the other planets to get food and resources. He decided to eliminate their common ancestor - Martin -  so that no space travel inventions would have existed. The others - cousins as he should call them - went back in time to save him and, consequently, save themselves. Martin also learns about the security system and the collection of weaponry they have to protect him. Soon Ninian leaves, and Martin, together with Raymond, moves into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. They talk about Martin\u2019s future occupation. Though he prefers engineering or physics, they choose art to avoid any accidental premature inventions he can create since he is already familiar with the science of the future. Martin becomes a second-rate artist, and his new guardian - Ives - arrives. He decides to buy a yacht - The Interregnum - and see the rest of the world with Martin. Martin doesn\u2019t develop any special feelings for his ancestors, except for Ives. Martin learns more about the future from him: only an enclave of a couple of million people left on Earth, and representatives of the lower classes got deported to the other planets and are being exploited; several worlds have already been made inhabitable. Ives admits that his brother is not completely wrong, but he still cannot let him destroy his life. \n\nOne winter, Ives rapidly dies from a severe chill in Tierra del Fuego after they stopped there for a bit. Years go by, and Martin loses any interest in life, sometimes painting the sea view from the yacht. They stop in Italy, and he sells two paintings. Wars force them to go to different hemispheres and the Arctic. Eventually, Martin turns a hundred and four when his last illness comes. Finally, Conrad appears. He shocks all the gathered ancestors by explaining that the sheltered life they had created for Martin didn\u2019t allow him to live his own life, or at least, have kids. When he dies, everyone will disappear, too. Martin figured it out years ago. Conrad assures him that his deed leads to a better future because he has been there. Erasing the future all his ancestors came from, Martin peacefully dies on the yacht, which drifts for years about the seas. "

        "Query": "What kind of relationship did Martin and Ives share in THE MAN OUTSIDE?",
        "Article": "Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call the\ndescendants\n   \n   cousin\n   \n  \u2014next assumed guardianship. Ives took his\nresponsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged\nto have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received\ncritical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest\nsale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not\ninterested.\n  \n \n  \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying\nyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n  \n \n  Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\nas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\nman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\nchange of air and scenery.\n  \n \n  \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented\nspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.\nTourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,\nwhich Martin christened\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  . They traveled about from sea\nto ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\ntrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the\nnearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\nsame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\nmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n  \n \n  The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\nlargely because they could spend so much time far away from the\ncontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\nthey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\nthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\ntime.\n  \n \n  More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\nthey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\nship, giving each other parties and playing an\n   \n   avant-garde\n   \n  form of\nshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\nended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\nhaving got advance information about the results.\n  \n \n  Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\nwhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\nthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\nhis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\n  \n<doc-sep>He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone\ntogether; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come\nfrom. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely\naccurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth\nproper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people\nleft on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly\ninterbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue\nof their distinguished ancestry.\n  \n \n  \"Rather feudal, isn't it?\" Martin asked.\n  \n \n  Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately\nplanned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.\nEverything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been\ndeported.\n  \n \n  \"Not only natives livin' on the other worlds,\" Ives said as the two\nof them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse\nof some ocean or other. \"People, too. Mostly lower classes, except\nfor officials and things. With wars and want and suffering,\" he added\nregretfully, \"same as in your day.... Like now, I mean,\" he corrected\nhimself. \"Maybe it\n   \n   is\n   \n  worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets\nfor us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.\nBombed. Very thorough job.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified\u2014interested,\neven.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong,\" Ives said, after\na pause. \"Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the\npeople\u2014I expect you could call them people\u2014there. Still\u2014\" he smiled\nshamefacedly\u2014\"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,\ncould I?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose not,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  \"Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except\nConrad, and even he\u2014\" Ives looked out over the sea. \"Must be a better\nway out than Conrad's,\" he said without conviction. \"And everything\nwill work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to\u2014to anything,\nif it doesn't.\" He glanced wistfully at Martin.\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he\ncouldn't even seem to care.\n  \n \n  During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin\nhad gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost\nwished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.\nBut he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....\n  \n \n  He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize\nthe basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have\nbeen Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one\nbitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from\nthe future\u2014one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to\ntake a medical degree\u2014but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was\nburied in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the\ncontinent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.\n  \n \n  A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were\ndressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond\nread the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical\ncousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy\nabout the entire undertaking.\n  \n \n  \"He died for all of us,\" Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over\nIves, \"so his death was not in vain.\"\n  \n \n  But Martin disagreed.\n  \n<doc-sep>Perhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air\u2014perhaps it\nwas the sheltered life\u2014but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was a\nhundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when\nthe family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no\nhope. Martin didn't think he could have borne another year of life.\n  \n \n  All the cousins gathered at the yacht to pay their last respects to\ntheir progenitor. He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and\nRaymond\u2014all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,\nspilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the\ndeck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed.\n  \n \n  Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had\nbeen spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming young\npeople\u2014all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed\nnever to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see\nrelief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their\nresponsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal\npity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered so\nirretrievably.\n  \n \n \n \n  There was only one face which Martin had never seen before. It wasn't\na strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it in\nthe looking glass when he was a young man.\n  \n \n  \"You must be Conrad,\" Martin called across the cabin in a voice that\nwas still clear. \"I've been looking forward to meeting you for some\ntime.\"\n  \n \n  The other cousins whirled to face the newcomer.\n  \n \n  \"You're too late, Con,\" Raymond gloated for the whole generation. \"He's\nlived out his life.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he hasn't lived out his life,\" Conrad contradicted. \"He's lived\nout the life\n   \n   you\n   \n  created for him. And for yourselves, too.\"\n  \n \n  For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his\nlineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there.\n  \n \n  \"Don't you realize even yet,\" Conrad went on, \"that as soon as he goes,\nyou'll go, too\u2014present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go up\nin the air like puffs of smoke?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Ninian quavered, her soft, pretty face alarmed.\n  \n \n  Martin answered Conrad's rueful smile, but left the explanations up to\nhim. It was his show, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Because you will never have existed,\" Conrad said. \"You have no right\nto existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time,\nso he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married,\n   \n   have\nchildren\n   \n  ....\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Cousin Ives enters Martin\u2019s life when he is a little older, and is the third descendant to accompany him as his guardian. Out of all his descendants to assume guardianship, Martin forms the closest relationship with Ives. Rather than seeing Martin as a responsibility and duty, Ives sees Martin as an individual and seeks ways to connect and encourage his passions. For one, Ives buys a yacht named The Interregnum to which the pair take upon themselves to explore the current world in. They traveled across the waters and inland to see both the civilized and uncivilized world, with Martin taking it all in. \n\nWhen it was just the two of them, their relationship progressed further. Ives began to open up about the future world that he and his descendants come from and explain the nuances of the social order that rules. Ives is the first to explicitly and honestly describe the feudal and privileged social class that Martin\u2019s descendants take part in, only due to their fortunate ancestry. Additionally, Ives is the only cousin to admit the potential truth in Conrad\u2019s intentions, noting the dilemma between achieving moral good and selfishing maintaining their own good life. Martin even comments his confidence in Ives being able to see the obvious flaw in the cousins\u2019 plans. However, during one winter, Ives fell ill to a severe chill and passed away before his own birth. After Ives\u2019 death, Martin relently voyages across oceans and soon as they and the cousins blur, he begins to live detachedly. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin shares a much better relationship with Ives than with the rest of the cousins. He is told to call Ives his cousin because he is older when Ives takes responsibility. Martin begins to paint more, and Ives arranges to have his works shown in a gallery. When there is little interest in his artwork, Ives reassures him that people will grow to enjoy them. Martin also thinks that Ives is the only one who tries to see him as an individual, even arranging a yacht to be bought so they can see the world. Martin likes spending time with Ives, and Ives also tells him about the world of the future. He explains to Martin that there is no poverty because only a couple million elusive and privileged people are left on the planet. Ives also explains that this system had been deliberately planned, leaving the lower class people and other planets\u2019 natives to suffer. He also is not even sure that Conrad\u2019s thinking is wrong, but he cannot bring himself to watch his way of life change. When Ives dies from his chill, Raymond makes a speech about his death not being in vain. Martin, however, disagrees. When Martin\u2019s paintings are bought later by an Italian museum, he thinks back to what Ives had said before and feels uncomfortable. As Martin lies dying, he thinks about how Ives is lucky to have been spared the same tragedy as the young people surrounding him. ",
        "Summary_3": "Ives is one of Martin's descendants who wants to protect him from the eventual arrival of Conrad to kill Martin. Ives and Martin have a very good relationship, as Ives tries to help Martin in his painting career. Ives also tells Martin of everything that has gone on in the future, and why Conrad wants to kill him. Martin would also contemplate life with Ives, and question the actions of the cousins. Ives also takes the effort to connect emotionally with Martin, which is when Ives dies it makes Martin very sad. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ives is the first so-called cousin who respects Martin and sees an individual in him. Ives seems to be smarter than the other cousins and is also more honest with him. He admits that the future is not as ideal as Raymond and Ninian claim. He says Conrad was not completely wrong about the unfairness of the future\u2019s way of life, but Ives himself still lacks the moral courage to be like him. Martin likes Ives, and even after the cousin dies, he thinks about him when he is older. "

He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Cousin Ives\u2014now that Martin was older, he was told to call the\ndescendants\n   \n   cousin\n   \n  \u2014next assumed guardianship.

Museums were not\ninterested.\n  \n \n  \"Takes time,\" Ives tried to reassure him. \"One day they'll be buying\nyour pictures, Martin. Wait and see.\"\n  \n \n  Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin\nas an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young\nman failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a\nchange of air and scenery.\n  \n \n  \"'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented\nspace travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.\nTourists always like ruins best, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,\nwhich Martin christened\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  . They traveled about from sea\nto ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making\ntrips inland. Martin saw the civilized world\u2014mostly in fragments; the\nnearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the\nsame as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous\nmuseum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.\n  \n \n  The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,\nlargely because they could spend so much time far away from the\ncontemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So\nthey never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although\nthere was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through\ntime.\n  \n \n  More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because\nthey came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard\nship, giving each other parties and playing an\n   \n   avant-garde\n   \n  form of\nshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\nended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\nhaving got advance information about the results.\n  \n \n  Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\nwhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\nthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\nhis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\n  \n<doc-sep>The ceaseless voyaging began again.\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  voyaged to every\nocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\na while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\ncame to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\napart as the different oceans.\n  \n \n \n \n  All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\nhis life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\nthe young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\ntheir elders.\n  \n \n  As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\nin the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\nfor fuel or supplies\u2014it was more economical to purchase them in that\nera than to have them shipped from the future\u2014he seldom went ashore,\nand then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\nthe sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea\u2014and\nsometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\nthat his other work lacked.\n  \n \n  When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\nsomewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\nhe could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\njourney. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\npurpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\ncousin's utter disgust.\n  \n \n  \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\ndo,\" the cousin\u2014who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\nscraping bottom now\u2014advised.\n  \n \n  Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\ndisillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\npurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\nHowever, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\nand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\nthe current cousin\u2014who was passing as his nephew by now.\n  \n \n  The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\na very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time\u2014waiting\nuntil we're off guard. And then\u2014pow!\u2014he'll attack!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\nmember of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\never have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\nconversation, anyhow.\n  \n \n  \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\nhis ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n  \n \n  Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\nhave every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\ngiven up carrying a gun long ago.\n  \n \n  There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\nout in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power\u2014fuel\nand man and will\u2014to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\ntime.\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\npassengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\nbore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The \u2018cousins\u2019 featured in this story are all direct descendants of Martin, identified to be great-great-granddaughters and -sons. Instructed to be called Aunts and Uncles by a young Martin and then later cousins by a mature Martin, they have rallied together to travel into the past in order to protect and guard Martin from an assassination attempt by Conrad. Conrad, a fellow cousin, is thought to be an idealist by his fellow cousins and adamantly wrong in his belief that the right thing to do is to erase their lineage in order to correct injustice in their future society. Despite the heroic protection of Martin, we find out that the cousins\u2019 guardianship of Martin is selfish in nature. Aside from Ives, Martin holds largely impersonal relationships with his cousins, who appear to view Martin as a reluctant duty. Because of Conrad as a looming threat over Martin\u2019s livelihood, a rotation of cousins traveling from the future assume guardianship over Martin and dictates his life in his hobbies or the information he knows - all to protect their own livelihood. \n\nAt Martin\u2019s deathbed, we find out that the cousins have had the wrong idea this entire time. In their insistence at protecting Martin and shaping his life to what they created for him, they signed their own death warrant. In all their planning and supposed intelligence and worthiness, the cousins have failed to observe the flaw in the plan: that if Martin had no wife and no children, then their very existence would be naught. Their forced presence in Martin\u2019s life had rid Martin\u2019s potential exciting existence - and in return - Martin\u2019s lackluster existence had rid the cousins of any kind of existence. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The role of the \u2018cousins\u2019 in the story is to protect Martin from Conrad coming to kill him. When Conrad begins to idealize a better world, the \u2018cousins\u2019 realize that this will change their way of life forever. Therefore, they decide to go back in time and protect Martin, so there is no way for Conrad to kill him. They must protect Martin because the \u2018cousins\u2019 are Martin\u2019s descendants from the future. The \u2018cousins\u2019 begin looking after Martin shortly after he is born, and they make him their responsibility to ensure that Conrad fails in his goals. The \u2018cousins\u2019 also use their vast family wealth to move him to a better neighborhood and hire tutors. Later, Raymond uses this money to move them to a remote mansion, where he continues to look after Martin. They even pool their resources to have him become an artist, and Ives later buys The Interregnum to go traveling. The \u2018cousins\u2019 are determined to change Martin\u2019s fate from the future without even realizing that they end up destroying themselves because they have controlled his life for so long. ",
        "Summary_3": "The cousins have a very important role in the story, as they took it upon themselves to save Martin\u2019s life, and stop their other cousin from killing him. By doing this, they end up basically ruining Martin's life, as in their efforts to protect him they stopped him from having a normal and happy life. It can also be said that cousin Conrad was in the right, as he was willing to sacrifice his life in order to stop the disastrous actions of humans in the future. ",
        "Summary_4": "After one of the descendants - Conrad - seemingly pans to go back in time and kill his ancestor - Martin, his other relatives decide to defend him from Conrad. They create a sheltered life for him and start taking care of Martin at the very beginning of the story, changing their shifts after some years. They make Martin move to different houses and then to a yacht, where he spends the rest of his life. They choose a profession for him, explain the future to him, and remind him about Conrad. They completely changed his life, erasing the future he was supposed to have. Simultaneously, they unconsciously ruin their own existence because, as we learn at the end, their overprotection didn\u2019t enable Martin to have a real life or a family with kids. Their unkind attitude towards Martin also doesn\u2019t make him emotionally connected to them. And he doesn\u2019t tell them about the mistake they made, eventually deciding that this version of the future probably should not exist."

        "Summary_1": "First, time is significant in this story as the main plotline to the cousins' interactions with Martin. With the future having time travel as a reality, characters in this story like Ninian are able to jump back and forth between the past - to bring Martin out of poverty and vulgar background - and the future to her present time. Although the characters in this story utilize time as an unchangeable and linear concept, we find out through hints in the story and at the final moment that time here is fluid and flexible. Anything that occurs in the past will affect the reality of the future. This is a startling pocket of truth that the cousins fail to realize until Martin\u2019s deathbed - where they are horrified to find out that their selfish desire to protect their comfortable reality in the future had actually led to their own demise and ridded their entire existence. \n\nAdditionally, time is used to explore the ruling ideologies of the social class both in present and in future. Despite the cousins proclaiming the future world to be free of poverty and highly privileged, Ives reveals that the realities of both worlds are similar in having wars and want and suffering. Only, with the latter future world dealing with these unsavory characters in exiling them and maintaining a feudal class system. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Time is very significant in this story because it relates to all characters. Conrad uses the time transmitter from Professor Farka to travel to the future to observe different possibilities. He also travels back one last time to see the dying Martin and tell him what they are doing for the universe\u2019s interest. Martin\u2019s descendants travel back in time to protect him from Conrad, but they control most of his life to the point where he has no free will. Martin, however, sees his time as abundant because he spends most of his time with his relatives anyways. They are the only people he ever interacts with, and he finds himself living a purposeless life with all of the free time that he has. However, time is also significant in that it is what eventually erases all of his descendants from the past, present, and future. ",
        "Summary_3": "Time plays a significant role in this story. Time is what allowed Martin's descendant to invent space travel, and is what eventually led to Conrad trying to kill him. Also, the cousins used time travel in order to go back to Martin\u2019s time and to try and protect him from Conrad\u2019s actions. Another important thing about time is that the cousins never aged as they protected Martin, leading to them stuck forever protecting Martin, until Martin dies, after which they never existed. ",
        "Summary_4": "Time in this story becomes a very flexible notion, allowing Martin\u2019s descendants to use time travel to find him in the past and protect Martin from Conrad, who wants to kill him, thus erasing the timeline in which humans use exploitation of other people and life forms. Thanks to time travel, Martin can meet his descendants and learn what the future looks like for humans. Their arrival changes his life, and initially, he becomes anxious and curious but eventually loses interest in everything around him because his sheltered existence deprives him of any real feelings, except for fear of Conrad. Their plan leads to the elimination of the future they came from, showing how changing the past events affects the future. "

They spent most of their time aboard\nship, giving each other parties and playing an\n   \n   avant-garde\n   \n  form of\nshuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually\nended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of\nhaving got advance information about the results.\n  \n \n  Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only\nwhen not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though\nthey were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court\nhis society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Ninian initially arrives, Martin blatantly considers her to be dumb. Dumb to hire a cleaning maid, dumb to freak out over Martin\u2019s absence at school, and dumb to hire a private tutor. Even with them moving to a different and more privileged neighborhood, he considers her dumb to go through all this effort to still remain conspicuous. \n\nAs the reasons behind the cousins\u2019 presence in the past and guardianship over Martin is revealed, his sentiment towards them remains the same. It seems that Martin is able to catch onto the obvious flaw in the cousins\u2019 plans quite early on, and yet with so many cousins slipping in and out, and despite their proclaimed intelligence, none of them are able to pick up on this flaw. The flaw being: with Martin having no children, their very existence becomes an impossibility. This is revealed at the end of the story where Martin is on his deathbed, noting that he had come to this conclusion many years before and had chosen not to say anything. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Martin's attitude towards the cousins does not ever really change throughout the story. Initially, he thinks that Ninian is foolish and fun to bait because she wounds up crying. Although Ninian does her best to care for him, he knows that all of his relatives are only doing it out of their interest. They see him as a rather unpleasant duty, while he does not try to get to know them either. When Raymond talks to him, he looks down on Martin and tries to be superior. Even when they move on to the yacht later, Martin only associates with them to not seem rude. The only cousin he becomes fond of is Ives because Ives is the only one who sees Martin as an individual. Martin becomes used to having them around, but it becomes difficult to tell them apart because there are many. Most of them are only interested in fulfilling their responsibility, so he does not get to know them apart from Ives. Even when the cousins realize from Conrad what they have done by controlling Martin, he is not surprised by how inept his descendants are. He does not seem too regretful about what his descendants have done until the end. ",
        "Summary_3": "At the beginning Martin believed the actions of his cousins, and everything they told him. While he got older and older, he started to see the flaws in the plans of his cousins. He understood that if they continued in that cycle then he would never live his life and have children. Even though he knew the flaws, he always followed what the cousins said, and never pointed out the flaws to them. He decided to follow the role that the cousins wanted him to follow. ",
        "Summary_4": "At the beginning of the story, Martin is curious about Ninian. But as other cousins arrive, he becomes less and less interested in them. They do not seem incredibly bright or eager to get to know him. They show that they are carrying out duty and never bother to be more considerate or show excitement. The only cousin that Martin likes is Ives because he tries to see Martin as an individual and is brighter than his other relatives. Martin\u2019s cousins cut him off from the life he got used to and never allow him to make his own decisions. He is trapped in their plan to save their lives, and they don't try to be respectful or care about his desires. Even when he is dying, their faces show a sign of relief. In general, Martin never felt any love or compassion for his descendants."

She seemed to\nbe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\nthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\nthrough her hallways.\n  \n \n  Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\na big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\nhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\nreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\nwere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\ncontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\nmoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\nneed a shave.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\nhand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n  \n \n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n  \n \n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n  \n \n  But\n   \n   something\n   \n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Get the jeeps out!\" Gwayne yelled at Jane. He yanked the door of\nthe little officers' lift open and jabbed the down button. It was\nagonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door\nback at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in\nconfusion. But someone was taking over now\u2014one of the crew women. The\njeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and\nGwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.\n  \n \n  There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was\nirritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to\nthe seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the\njeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked\nup speed. The other two followed.\n  \n \n  There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;\nsurrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked\nhorrible in a travesty of manhood.\n  \n \n  The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were\nracing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung\nabout, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty\nmiles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in\nspite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived\ndownward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.\n  \n \n  \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool to\nleave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the\nkids. But it was too late to go back.\n  \n \n  The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into\na gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he\nhad to slow as the fog thickened lower down.\n  \n \n  Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own\ntrail to confuse the pursuers.\n  \n \n  There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a\nglimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse\nfaces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the\nwindshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the\nsteering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.\n  \n \n  The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The\nother jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late\nto help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or\nthe horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.\n  \n \n  A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.\n  \n \n  He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature\nseemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.\n  \n \n  Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward\nagainst the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot\nleader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on each\nshoulder.\n  \n \n  The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creature\nleaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, diving\nfor the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\"\nBarker said. There was a grin on the doctor's lips, but his face was\ntaut with strain.\n  \n \n  The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on\nits head. It was the golden comet of a captain.\n  \n \n  \"He never meant to hurt the kids\u2014just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\nquickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed. He can't talk very\nwell. Says they've had to change the language around to make the sounds\nfit, and he's forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it\ngets easier as you listen. It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\non the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\nEnglish, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n  \n \n  \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\nkid's dog have? How many were brown?\"\n  \n \n  The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the\ncuriously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment\nspread out.\n  \n \n  Three. Seven. Zero.\n  \n \n  The answers were right.\n  \n \n  By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the\ntwisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a\nlong time telling.\n  \n \n  When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in\nsilence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it\npossible, Doc?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not\nby what I know. But it happened. I've looked at a few tissues under\nthe microscope. The changes are there. It's hard to believe about\ntheir kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can't be\na hereditary change\u2014the things that affect the body don't change the\ngerm plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe\nthe fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped\ndown to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of\nmonsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as\ntall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high.\n  \n \n  The kids of the exploring party....\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Starship Pandora lands on a planet where an exploring ship and a rescue group disappear. Captain Gwayne was ordered to come and inspect the lost ships for a week. They prolong their stay because of a discovery of the carefully buried ship whose parts were exposed by a landslide and detected by a metal locator a few days ago. When two cadets, Kaufman and Pinelli, and one member, Doctor Barker, approach to examine the buried ship, a horde of mysterious creatures come to them. The leader of mysterious creatures, tall and man-like, kidnaps the two cadets with his members and runs away. Captain Gwayne and other crew members ride on jeeps and chase after the monsters. When they catch up to the mysterious leader, the cadets are sitting on each shoulder of the leader without harm. Captain Gwayne and Doctor Barker collaborate to defeat the leader and bring it back to the ship.\n\nAfter bringing back the captive, Captain Gwayne has learned from the creature that he is Hennessy, the missing captain of the buried ship. He reveals that the blobs, a peculiarity on the planet, can change the cells in living creatures to help them adapt to the planet, which has done to Captain Hennessy and his crew members. All the mysterious creatures surrounding the ship are either the original crew members or their descendants. They decided to bury the ship after noticing the changes. After he finished the story, Captain Hennessy went to gather with his people. And now, Captain Gwayne faces the same situation as Captain Hennessy did in the past: either die when they go back to the Earth or stay on the planet to become a different creature, which at least makes humankind survive differently. Captain Gwayne decides to stay, so he discharges all the fuel out to not let the ship live again. He then tells Jane Corey, the Lieutenant, the truth and his decision. They both know that they have to stay for the better strength of the species after generations because humankind needs to have at least one hope to spread their seeds, even in a different shape. They will obliterate all their traces so that the Earth will send no more humans to the planet.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Gwayne is a weary fourty-year old man who captains the starship Pandora, as one of the many colonies traveling around space to find a new planet that can sustain human life like Earth. Accompanied by Lieutenant Jane Corey, he is informed that two of the space cadets snuck outside the ship. Among the outside landscape includes blobs, who are described to be a peculiarity of this particular planet; seemingly harmless but are ugly in looks.\n\nGwayne wishes to study them more thoroughly, but is reminded of his mission in deviating to this planet to search for Captain Hennessey and his men, who had abandoned their ship. As the cadets are heading back to Gwayne\u2019s ship, a herd of blobs disperses in excitement and instead they begin to hover over a singular spot. The cadets turn to find a horde of things heading towards them, described to be vaguely man-like with a distinct leader at eight feet tall, and all of them holding objects like spears or sticks. In a race to reach the cadets before the things did, Gwayne, Jane and other officers raced in Jeeps towards the boys. Noticing the incoming Jeeps, the creatures grabbed the boys and disappeared into the mists, with the officers following fast in pursuit. Plowing through them, Gwayne touches a blob whose shape passes around it. As they confront the eight foot leader, it suddenly drops the boys and Gwayne and Doc Barker knock it out of consciousness. \n\nWith the boys safe, they take the unconscious creature back to the ship to try and see if the creature had anything to do with Hennessey\u2019s disappearance and buried ship. Any information revealed would be pivotal in determining this planet\u2019s habitability, as it is revealed that Earth was threatened with the Sun going nova and hence the human race found themselves in a scramble to find a replacement home. Gwayne and Jane then visit Barker and the now-awake creature, who immediately greets Gwayne in some garbled English. They find out that the leader of the creature is actually Captain Hennessy who had grabbed the kids with the intention of talking to them. It turns out that Hennessey and his crew have physically changed due to the planet, turning them into man-like creatures with an adapted English language. \n\nMore so, it is revealed that blobs enjoy having the humans around, and are subtly changing and adapting the human cells. It is what happened to Hennessy and is already happening to Gwayne because he\u2019s been touched. However, the rest of his crew could go back but are unable to because Gwayne has dumped the fuel. In the end, we find out that Gwayne and Jane consider the answer to finding a new planet to be void, as they only thing they could do is find a new spawning ground, which they would be able to achieve if both crews spawn a new race on this planet and eventually, explore the star lanes once again. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is about a ship captain, Gwayne, and his team arriving on a new planet. It is revealed that they were on that planet because two different expeditions had gone there before and neither had returned, so Gwayne and his team were there to see what had happened. It is also revealed that Earth\u2019s sun was going nova, which is why humans were exploring and looking to colonize other planets. The planet is inhabited by blobs, spirit-like alien creatures, who seem harmless. Gwayne sends 2 kids to check the planet, and when they return the ship and the crew are ambushed by a horde of alien-like creatures. When the leader captures the two cadets, Gwayne rushes out and, with the help of another crew member, rescues the kids and captures the leader. When the crew\u2019s doctor checks the leader, they find out that the creature is actually the captain of the previous mission, and Gwayne\u2019s friend. Gwayne realizes that this was the blobs\u2019 doing, and that they can change and adapt the body of human beings. After this is revealed, the crew decides that they should all stay on the planet, and bury the ship. This would allow the humans to create a new colony there with the blobs, and allow them to help each other, as the blobs could in a far future help the changed humans adapt to different planets. ",
        "Summary_4": "The starship Pandora creaks and groans as she settles on an ugly world. The starship is two hundred light-years away from Earth. Captain Gwayne curses and reaches for his boots; he shuffles to the control room where Lieutenant Jane Corey is waiting. Jane reports that a dozen mysterious blobs held a convention north, but they had broken off about an hour ago. She also informs him that the two cadets have snuck out again, to which Gwayne swears because Kaufman and Pinelli have no sense of caution. The Sol-type Sun begins to rise, but there is so much fog everywhere that it is impossible to see. He observes three blobs but knows that there is no time because Earth sent him here to check for any signs of Hennessy\u2019s ship. Suddenly, Jane calls him to say that the two cadets are back. Strange creatures appear, and Gwayne yells at Jane to get the jeeps out. Once they drive, the menacing horde notices the jeeps and begins to run away with the cadets faster. Although the creatures try to stop their pursuers, the jeep goes through and catches a glimpse. Once the creature with the two cadets is in front of him, Gwayne dives to get the cadets back. Doc Barker hits the creature seconds after, and this causes the creature to collapse. The men examine the cadets, while Doc and Gwayne wonder if the creature could be the key to the missing ship. They discuss how the native creatures could have gone undetected, while Gwayne explains that it is time for him to go and get the ship back to Earth. The report from the cadets is enough, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the creatures and the missing crew. However, there needs to be an answer fast because Earth is close to extinction from the Sun. Since nobody would be able to live in the Solar System when that happens, the explorers must go out and find another world. Everybody does their part because the Sun will explode in ten years, while some of the strange planets would give man the opportunity to repopulate. Gwayne receives a call from Doc Barker and goes to see the creature. The creature is Captain Hennessy, and he has forgotten how to speak English because they had to change the language to make the sounds fit. When Gwayne questions the creature, it answers correctly; they listen to Hennessy\u2019s story. Gwayne leads former Hennessy out and goes back to the control room to discharge the ship\u2019s fuel tanks. It is revealed that the blobs can adapt to cells and have no choice but to stay because they are already changed. Jane figures that they have really not been changed yet, but she concludes spawning ground. The fifty men and women can replenish the Earth here, and Gwayne knows that their children would one day find a way to the star lanes again to spread the children of men further. "

The tall eight foot leader, who actually turned out to be Hennessy, was knocked out after a confrontation and in conversation with Gwayne, Jane and the Doc, reveals how he and his crew came to be the creatures. It turns out that the blobs had great curiosity and interest in the humans and desired to keep them around, and so through contact with the humans, eventually changed and adapted their cells to be able to live on this planet. The change resulted in going from humans to man-like creatures with more primitive instincts, an adapted English language with distorted yet strong physiques. \n\nAfter explaining this to the officers aboard Pandora, Hennessy is released off the ship and back onto the planet, where he is greeted by the blobs and the rest of his monstrous crew. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Hennessy is a captain of one of the human\u2019s colonizing ships. He is sent to a new planet in order to check up on a failed mission there. When he arrives, he and his crew get in contact with the blobs of the planet, which end up physically changing them into monster-like creatures. They decide to bury the ship and cut ties with the humans, in order to stop the same thing from happening to others. After a few years, a new ship arrives under the leadership of captain Gwayne. When two cadets of the ship are sent to explore the planet, Hennessy tries to talk to them, but this action is taken as a violent act by the ship, which ends up with the crew capturing him and taking him back to the ship. There the crew realizes that the creature is in fact Hennessy, and the crew realizes the position that they are in now. ",
        "Summary_4": "Hennessy is one of the captains of a ship that was sent to check on an exploration party that disappeared. His own ship disappears too, which is why Gwayne\u2019s ship is sent to check up on the vile planet. Although Hennessy is initially thought to have disappeared, his ship is found in a deep gorge hidden by fog. Gwayne and his crew spend the majority of their time trying to find any traces of Hennessy or his crew. Later, it is revealed that Hennessy had actually adapted and become something akin to one of the creatures that they encounter. He has forgotten how to speak normal English as a result of having to change the language around to make the sounds fit. When Gwayne tests him, Hennessy knows that there are three barmaids at the Cheshire Cat; his oldest son\u2019s dog has seven pups, and none of them are brown. Hennessy then tells his story, and Gwayne leads him out to where a crowd of monsters is waiting.  "

She seemed to\nbe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\nthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\nthrough her hallways.\n  \n \n  Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\na big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\nhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\nreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\nwere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\ncontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\nmoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\nneed a shave.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\nhand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n  \n \n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n  \n \n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n  \n \n  But\n   \n   something\n   \n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup.\n  \n<doc-sep>For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  \"My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n  \n \n  \"Who?\" I interrupted.\n  \n \n  \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\n   \n   Alpha\n   \n  rays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\n   \n   Beta\n   \n  or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n  \n \n  \"When any form of life is exposed to these\n   \n   Gamma\n   \n  rays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n  \n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n  \n \n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n  \n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n  \n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n  \n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n  \n \n  I shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n  \n \n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\n   \n   en masse\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n  \n \n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\n  \n \n \n   Zinnng-whack!\n   \n \n \n  \"All right!\"\n  \n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n  \n \n  A heat ray!\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor.

I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country?

Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n",

It was the golden comet of a captain.\n  \n \n  \"He never meant to hurt the kids\u2014just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\nquickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed.

It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\non the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\nEnglish, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n  \n \n  \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\nkid's dog have?

It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n  \n \n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n  \n \n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n  \n \n  But\n   \n   something\n   \n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The blobs are insect-like creatures with skeletons inside with four to twelve legs on their bodies. They are harmless. They are curious about any moving objects on the ground. They can change the cells in any living thing to adapt to the planet. They like humans, so they change their cells to let them stay on the planet.\n\nThe blobs are the main reason why Captain Hennessy and Gwayne decide to stay on the planet. They choose to stay because the blobs make them able to survive on the planet without having to change the whole planet to do so. Without the blobs, they may leave to search for other planets that can let humans survive. But with the blobs, someday in the future, humans may be able to seek out more possibilities in other worlds where the blobs will help them adapt to the new environments. In addition, the blobs also change their shape from only a twelve-leg body to having a four-leg form, which is also evidence of how they like human beings.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The blobs are the native inhabitants of this peculiar planet that the characters are exploring in this story. Observed as seemingly harmless and curious, the blobs aren\u2019t given too much caution in the beginning of the story. However, the behavior of the blobs seem to indicate the presence of humans or creatures and as the story continues, are revealed to play a role in the latter. \n\nIt turns out that the blobs have adaptive capabilities to them - and have already used these capabilities to change the cell structure of Hennessy and his crew - changing them from humans to man-like creatures. While they are no longer like Earth humans, these man-like creatures are able to survive on this planet. This is significant because this story details man\u2019s mission in searching for a habitable planet and the survival of the human race  - and through the blob\u2019s amusement of man and adaptive capabilities - have discovered this form of survival. Rather than humans colonizing the planet like we may assume, the blobs indicate the planet changing the humans and signify the new reality for Captain Gwayne and his crew. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The blobs are the inhabitants of the new planet that are described as spirit-like. The crew believes that the blobs are harmless. After they find Hennessy, the crew realizes that the blobs can affect the humans, and adapt their bodies to different environments. Because of the impending explosion of the sun, humans are desperately looking for different planets where humans can live. Gwayne realizes that the blobs could be very important for the survival of the human species, because if the humans stay on the planet, the blobs could help the humans adapt to different planetary conditions in the future. ",
        "Summary_4": "The blobs are a peculiarity on the planet and look like overgrown fireballs. They are initially very curious about humans, but they are not harmless. These blobs, however, later prove to be significant because they are capable of changing human cells to better adapt to the alien environment. The blobs find people amusing and like having them around. Gwayne mentions that life before man came used to have twelve legs, but the blobs have changed that. Another reason why the blobs are significant is that they have adapted man to the alien world instead of the other way around. Since men usually have to adapt the planet to their needs, being touched by a blob does the opposite and brings a human further away from human society. "

        "Article": "It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n<doc-sep>The race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons\ninto a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to\nprevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found\na drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent life\nthere to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.\n  \n \n  But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had\nfinally proved that the sun was going to go nova.\n  \n \n  It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go\u2014but it would\nrender the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,\nman had to colonize.\n  \n \n  And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The\nexplorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the\nterraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships\nbegan filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve\nspace.\n  \n \n  Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and\nfour more months back.\n  \n \n  In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the\nfootholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe some\nof the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe none\nwould be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each was\nprecious as a haven for the race.\n  \n \n  If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, as\nit now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.\n  \n \n  Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to\nstrip them of their world, but the first law was survival.\n  \n \n  But how could primitives do what these must have done?\n  \n \n  He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of\ncemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully\nlaminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human\nhand had been able to do for centuries.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can\nsee a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested.\n  \n \n  He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were\nsquatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.\nThey were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?\nFor the return of their leader\u2014or for something that would give the\nship to them?\n  \n \n  Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How's the captive coming?\"\n  \n \n  Barker's voice sounded odd.\n  \n \n  \"Physically fine. You can see him. But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore\nat Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not\nchecking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.\n  \n \n  There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling\nsound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker\nseemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.\n  \n \n  The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The\nthick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make\nsome kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up\nunerringly toward the device on the officer's cap.\n  \n \n  \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "After the invention of atomic weapons, humans maintained peace for nearly two centuries. However, four decades ago, observation revealed that the sun would soon go nova, which would make the whole solar system uninhabitable for millennia. Since then, humans have been searching for habitable planets in other solar systems. They send many starships carrying deep-sleep stored people to different worlds, hoping they could be the colonies for the human race in the future, but none has promised to be safe for generations. So the exploring teams are sent continuously. Yet the situation is challenging. The training schools cannot export enough astronauts, so promising young candidates are trained as cadets on starships. Humans do not have enough time to find another Earth to live on for generations.",
        "Summary_2": "On Earth, the human race is threatened by the Sun\u2019s imminent reality of going nova. Despite surviving the discovery of atomic weapons and preventing an interplanetary war, the Sun going nova meant that humans had to find another world to inhabit and colonize in order to continue to survive, as even the Solar System would be uninhabitable for a while. \nAs such, explorers like Captain Gwayne and Hennessy were sent out to discover new worlds that may be habitable for humans with deep-sleeping colonizers while teams of terraformers did their best. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The human race on Earth is facing probable extinction. This is because they found out that the sun is going nova, which means that the Sun is going to explode soon, leading to the extinction of the human race. This has caused the human race to search different planets where they could live and colonize. This whole process is what set up the arrival of Gwayne\u2019s crew on the planet to search for Hennessy. Hennessy\u2019s ship was sent to the planet to scout and see if humans could live there. ",
        "Summary_4": "The human race on Earth will be destroyed when the sun goes nova. Since this event will render the entire Solar System uninhabitable for millenia, people will have to colonize other planets. There is a team of explorers going out to find a world in desperation, terraforming teams, and big starships are also sent out with colonists in a deep sleep to conserve space. By the time they go to the new planet, the sun will explode in ten years and kill the entire human race on Earth. Even though humans enjoy their life on Earth, they know that they must find a new place to adapt to because the world will become destroyed. The human race might also go to these new planets to spawn and spread the same seeds that they did on Earth. "

        "Summary_1": "The story is about a family man - Henry Devers - returning to his hometown after a unique adventure. He was participating in an experimental flight that ended in an explosion. But he managed to survive thanks to regenerative technologies that helped rebuild his body and make him breathe again. The story starts with a grandiose tour around his town where the mayor, the National Guard, the Fire Department bands, and many other people participate though they all seem a little distant and scared to Devers. The official car lets him off at his house that, as he notices, has changed a little. Edith, his wife, and Ralphie, his ten-year-old son, meet him at the door. Later, in the living room, they have an awkward conversation about Ralphie\u2019s school grades, his son quickly leaves for a baseball game, and soon Devers goes to sleep in his separate twin bed that his wife bought while he was away. He looks at his scars before going to bed, thinking about how people\u2019s behavior changed because they believe Henry has changed.  \nIn the evening, Henry\u2019s mother, uncle Joe, and aunt Lucille come for dinner. Again everyone seems aloof: Henry\u2019s overly affectionate mother now barely touches him and even cries for several minutes, his aunt and uncle cannot talk about casual things - no one looks him in the eyes. After all, Devers gets infuriated and screams at the guests, they leave, and his son once again tries to leave instead of spending time with the parents. Later in the evening, Edith wakes her husband because his good friends Phil and Rhona came - they all go to bowling alleys and then to a tavern. Even Devers\u2019 close friends seem stiff and cautious while talking to him, dancing with him, being around him. On their way back, Phil tries to make a joke about a cemetery but stops himself from finishing it - this upsets Henry even more, completely ruining the evening. When they get home Edith tries to apologize to her husband and admits that she\u2019s frightened. In reply, he says that soon such regenerative technologies and processes will be an ordinary thing, and his captain, for example, who died together with Devers, will soon leave the hospital, too. She asks him to be patient with everybody. \n\n",

His Honor\u2019s handclasp is somewhat moist and cold, with eyes holding traces of remoteness. Henry Devers is still honored, and there is a tour up Main street to where the mayor waits alongside a young homecoming queen. Hank looks out to the crowd, and there is a lot of national interest because he is the First One. He is glad that the official greeting is over, and all he wants to do is see his family again. When Hank goes back to 45 Roosevelt Street, the house has changed for the better. He is glad not to have to deal with more strangers and is surprised by having to use the ornamental knocker on the new door. Edith opens the door with their son Ralphie in her arms, and the family shares a sweet moment. Edith hesitates to take a seat next to him. When Hank asks about Ralphie, the boy says that it is now summer vacation. However, Edith says that he has been doing excellent in school. He remembers back to their farewells at the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. Ralphie suddenly says he must go to pitch for the Inter-Town Little League; Hank tells Edith that he is tired. She leads him upstairs, where there are two twin beds in entirely new furniture. Hank assumes that Edith has created this barrier between them because he has changed too much. When she leaves, Hank goes to look at his scars. He hopes Edith does not have to see them, even though he did not consider the scars when he left the Walter Reed Hospital. As Hank dozes off, he thinks about wishing to regain his old relationships. His mother, Uncle Joe, and Aunt Lucille all come when dinner approaches. Hank tries to compliment his mother over grapefruit, and she bursts into tears. Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille make little to no attempts to talk either, making Hank angry because nobody treats him like a human being. Hank falls asleep, but Phil and Rhona come to take everyone to a bowling alley. Hank agrees to Phil\u2019s request to drink and continues to do so in Manfred\u2019s Tavern. He tries to dance with Rhona, who looks as if she will be sick, and even his wife is reluctant to dance with him. When the entire party drives back, Hank jokes about a cemetery and wonders if he should just lie in an open grave. Edith tries to apologize to him and says that they all need some time to get used to him being back when he should have died. Hank tells her that the government is doing everything they can and that he has not seen anything in the six and half months.

Hank also worked extensively with General Carlisle, a commanding officer who engineers the entire trip and goes on to win a Nobel Prize. His family sheds tears and embraces him when he leaves the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. There is an explosion, and everybody assumes that he has died. When he returns eleven months later, a homecoming party is held for him. However, no one in the crowd is overly enthusiastic to see him, and they are all nervous about his appearance as the First One. After the official ceremonies, he is excited to go home and see his family again after being away from home for eleven months. However, everyone has changed, and he can no longer fit in with them because they are not used to him being alive. Ralphie does everything he can to stay away from his father, and Edith has rearranged their bedroom so that the both of them sleep separately. When he dines with the rest of his family, Hank\u2019s mother cries at the sight of him and does not take his compliment kindly. His other relatives, Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille, also try not to talk, even though his family is known for their love of talking. Hank is tired of everybody treating him as some alien and angrily sends everyone away. Even when Phil and Rhona visit, their interactions are not the same as before. Nobody wants to treat Hank usually, and they are all frightened that he is still alive when he is supposed to be dead. Hank hopes that everything will work out in time, and he tells Edith that there will be more men coming back. ",

He died in an incident seven months ago but then retrieved his life by new regenerative technology. He has scars all over his body. He likes the sunshine and the fresh air in the morning. After he regained his life, he returned to his hometown as the first person to rebreathe from death. However, when he comes home, everyone treats him differently than he was before. He notices the differences, but he thinks they need time to adjust to the new changes. However, after being disappointed by several reunions with his family and close friends, he feels isolated and frustrated with the situation. He wants to be treated normally, but everyone surrounding him needs time for the new and terrifying change.

As he returns to his hometown, he is accompanied by some U.S. army members, and meets with the town\u2019s mayor. This makes it seem as if he was an astronaut, military member, or something similar. He gets a very cold reception from everyone in the town, including his own wife and son. This seems to bother him as he hopes everything will be back to normal. It is also revealed that he was in an accident that left his body scarred during his journey. As Henry reconnects with his mother, she also has a very bad reaction to seeing him, as she starts crying and can't seem to be close to him. All of these reactions make Henry very angry. When he gets the chance to go out with his childhood friends, he is very excited as he believes that they will treat him normally. This isn\u2019t the case and after going with them and passing through a graveyard, we realize that what had happened to Henry is that he had died. After he died, Henry was put through a regenerative procedure to revive him, which is where his scars come from, and why everyone was so weird around him. He ends up fighting with his wife, but he realizes that time is needed for everyone to go back to normal and accept this new technology. "

        "Query": "What is the significance of the regenerative technology in THE FIRST ONE story?",
        "Article": "There were two small items of interest to me in the Times the following\nmorning.\n  \n \n  One two-inch story\u2014barely making page one because of a hole to fill at\nthe bottom of an account of the number of victims of Indian summer heat\nprostration\u2014told of the incineration of a warehouse on Fleet Street by\nan ingenious new arson bomb that left \"virtually\" no trace. (Maybe the\nfire inspector had planted a few traces to make his explanation more\ncreditable.)\n  \n \n  The second item was further over in a science column just off the\neditorial page. It told of the government\u2014!\u2014developing a new process\nof waste disposal rivaling the old Buck Rogers disintegrator ray.\n  \n \n  This, I presumed, was one of Tony Carmen's information leaks.\n  \n \n  If he hoped to arouse the public into demanding my invention I\ndoubted he would succeed. The public had been told repeatedly of a\nnew radioactive process for preserving food and a painless way of\nspraying injections through the skin. But they were still stuck with\nrefrigerators and hypodermic needles.\n  \n \n  I had forced my way half-way through the paper and the terrible coffee\nI made when the doorbell rang.\n  \n \n  I was hardly surprised when it turned out to be Tony Carmen behind the\nfront door.\n  \n \n  He pushed in, slapping a rolled newspaper in his palm. \"Action,\nProfessor.\"\n  \n \n  \"The district attorney has indicted you?\" I asked hopefully.\n  \n \n  \"He's not even indicted\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Venetti. No, I got a feeler on this\nplant in the\n   \n   Times\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"The government will take over the invention, no\nmatter what the public wants.\"\n  \n \n  \"The public? Who cares about the public? The Arcivox corporation wants\nthis machine of yours. They have their agents tracing the plant now.\nThey will go from the columnist to his legman to my man and finally to\nyou. Won't be long before they get here. An hour maybe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arcivox makes radios and TV sets. What do they want with the\nExpendables?\"\n  \n \n  \"Opening up a new appliance line with real innovations. I hear they got\na new refrigerator. All open. Just shelves\u2014no doors or sides. They\nwant a revolutionary garbage disposal too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you own stock in the company? Is that how you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"I own stock in a competitor. That's how I know,\" Carmen informed me.\n\"Listen, Professor, you can sell to Arcivox and still keep control of\nthe patents through a separate corporation. And I'll give you 49% of\nits stock.\"\n  \n \n  This was Carmen's idea of a magnanimous offer for my invention. It\n   \n   was\n   \n  a pretty good offer\u201449% and my good health.\n  \n \n  \"But will the government let Arcivox have the machine for commercial\nuse?\"\n  \n \n  \"The government would let Arcivox have the hydrogen bomb if they found\na commercial use for it.\"\n  \n \n  There was a sturdy knock on the door, not a shrill ring of the bell.\n  \n \n  \"That must be Arcivox now,\" Carmen growled. \"They have the best\ndetectives in the business. You know what to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  I knew what to tell them.\n  \n<doc-sep>III\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

After that, I followed Sanderson\u2019s work in the\nTwilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\nblood, sure as death.\n  \n \n  But it was Mikuta\u2019s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\nknow Tom Mikuta? I don\u2019t suppose you did. No, not Japanese\u2014Polish-American.\nHe was a major in the Interplanetary Service\nfor some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\nhis commission.\n  \n \n  He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\ndid a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\nthe Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\nyears together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\nsince the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\nCrater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  \n \n  I\u2019d always liked the Major\u2014he was big and quiet and cool,\nthe sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\nahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight\nplace. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\nwith no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\nof personality that could take a crew of wild men and\nmake them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\nmiles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  \n \n  He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\nfirst. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\nold times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he\u2019d\nbeen out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\nand how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\nyear\u2014and then he wanted to know what I\u2019d been doing since\nVenus and what my plans were.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo particular plans,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n  \n \n  He looked me over. \u201cHow much do you weigh, Peter?\u201d\n  \n \n  I told him one-thirty-five.\n  \n \n  \u201cThat much!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there can\u2019t be much fat on\nyou, at any rate. How do you take heat?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou should know,\u201d I said. \u201cVenus was no icebox.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, I mean\n   \n   real\n   \n  heat.\u201d\n  \n \n  Then I began to get it. \u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right. A hot trip.\u201d He grinned at me. \u201cMight be\ndangerous, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhat trip?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBrightside of Mercury,\u201d the Major said.\n  \n \n  I whistled cautiously. \u201cAt aphelion?\u201d\n  \n \n  He threw his head back. \u201cWhy try a Crossing at aphelion?\nWhat have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\nheat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\ndrum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\ndays later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\nabout it.\u201d He leaned across me eagerly. \u201cI want to make\na Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\na man can do that, he\u2019s got Mercury. Until then,\n   \n   nobody\u2019s\n   \n  got\nMercury. I want Mercury\u2014but I\u2019ll need help getting it.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\nit. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\nturns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\nthe Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\nThat makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\nplace in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\nsurface of the Sun itself.\n  \n \n  It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\njust\n   \n   how\n   \n  hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\nwas a real hell\u2019s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\nwould cross it.\n  \n \n  I wanted to be along.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal.

        "Summary_1": "Svan, a leader of members in the Council on Venus, plots to revolt against the Earthman delegations who are going to bring back the news of the habitability of Venus. Initially, he eavesdrops on the conversation between the Office of the Deck and the Executive Officer, which is about the untrustworthiness of Venusians, the descendants of the first generation of Earthman who migrated to Venus. Svan then initiates a revolting plan against the Earthman.\n\nBy showing this conversation to the group, Svan convinces the members to conduct his plan of not letting the Earthman ship go back to the Earth. In his plan, they will drive near the ship, five people will cause some chaos to attract the guards, and one person will put the delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship. They draw lots to determine when they decide who will put the bomb. However, Svan finds that no one admits to being the one, so he draws a cross on his slip, pretending to be the one who has terrible luck. \n\nAfter assigning the tasks to each person, Svan and his members drive to cross the border, where Svan brings down a native guard. When they separate to let one group cause the commotion and let Svan put the bomb, Svan takes out one bomb and leaves another one in the car. He knows that the bomb on the car will explode and attract the Earthman guards, which is unknown by the other members. He sees the car leave and turns to wait for the explosion. But the car comes back because the native guards found the rifle left by the murdered guard. The members in the car try to pick up Svan to flee from the search of the Earthman when Svan tries his best to run away. The explosion happens. Svan is on the verge of death when the Office of the Deck and the Executive Officer come to see him. They find a slip with a cross drawn on both sides in his hand.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story follows two different groups of people. One of these is a crew of humans from earth that arrived on venus with the purpose of scouting and of negotiating with the venus natives to prepare for the arrival of more humans. These natives were in fact the descendants of the first group of humans that arrived on venus. Even though they are humans, their physical appearance has adapted to the venusian atmosphere. When the humans arrive, a group of natives called \u201cThe Council\u201d decided to bomb the ship of the humans. To decide the person who would sneak on the ship to plant the bomb, the natives marked a slip with an X and randomly picked slips. When no one came forward, the leader of the natives, Svan, decided to do it himself. Because the person with the X didn\u2019t come forward, Svan didn\u2019t trust his group anymore. Therefore, after the group sneaked past a guard, Svan decided to blow up both the car with his team and the ship. Svan and his team split up, and just as the car\u2019s bomb was going to explode, they returned to Svan because they were caught. This led to all of them getting blown up. When the crew of the human ship found the bodies, they saw that Svan had in fact a slip with X\u2019s on both sides. ",

A delegation from Earth just arrived on Venus, and everyone wonders what is going to happen next now that people know Venus is habitable. \n\nThe Executive Officer - the Exec - and the Officer of the Deck - Lowry -  talk in the Earth-ship\u2019s open lock. The Exec doubts the natives\u2019 friendliness and does not consider them human anymore. Lowry tries to explain that their appearance doesn't affect their amiability. He also tells the Exec that some natives are afraid of the possible wave of immigration from Earth because it can ruin their regular way of life, and some underground group is spreading the word that the consequences will be even worse. Lowry adds that it\u2019s possible but is interrupted by a loud voice notifying them about a spy ray focused on their lock. The Exec alerts their guards and the delegation. \n\nThe ray was used by Svan and five other representatives of the Council - an underground organization fighting against any partnerships with humans. They hear Lowry\u2019s words, and Svan becomes infuriated. He persuades everyone, including Ingra who initially hesitates, that they can\u2019t let the delegation come back to Earth. Svan plans to plant a bomb in the ship, it will detonate on the delegation\u2019s way back, killing everyone. Others are uncertain, so Svan decides to randomly pick the one who will plant the bomb. When he sees that his slip is blank, he thinks that someone is afraid to admit that they had the slip with the cross. So Svan quickly marks his slip and pretends to be the one who was initially chosen. He explains the specifics of their plan: while he will be near the ship, the others will fake a car accident to draw some guards which will allow Svan to get in. Their car is stopped by the State Guard who realizes that Svan is the reason the state of danger was declared. Svan kills the guard and hides the body. He takes one bomb and leaves another one in the car, hoping that the explosion will draw enough attention and punish the five people he now considers fearful traitors. Before the car takes off, Ingra kisses Svan. He waits near the ship fumbling with his slip and wondering who the coward was. Suddenly, he hears the car is driving back. Ingra screams that they were chased, but got away and came back for Svan. He starts running from the car, realizing the bomb inside it is supposed to detonate. The explosion wave knocks him out. Later, he wakes up near a surgeon, who calmly declares that Svan will soon die from the wounds, and shocked Lowry. The surgeon is confused by a paper slip with a cross marked on both sides he found clenched in Svan\u2019s hand. ",
        "Summary_4": "In James Mac Creigh's short story Doublecross, the actions revolve around two opposing sides of the storyline of the planet Venus. The Officer of the Deck on the Earth spaceship reports to The Executive Officer about a pathetic underground group of dissidents who spread the rumor that immigrants will kill the indigenous Venusians, descendants of the first expedition. During their arrogant conversation, the ship receives news of an attempted attack.\n\tAn underground organization controlled by an indigenous Venusian, Svan, overhears the ship's delegation's conversation about their contemptuous attitude towards the natives. Svan is determined not to let the Earth colonizers leave Venus and destroy the ship before its departure. The council informs the Venusians that only they had the right to decide the course of action. The underground organization agrees that if the Earth ship returned, it would mean disaster for Venus. Therefore, it should not return. Svan plans to sneak aboard at night and attach the Atomit magnetic time bomb to the ship. However, the commander faces the problem of betrayal, indecision, and cowardice among his renegade team. Svan suggests that the operation draws lots to decide who will be honored to perform the most critical part of the plan - the attachment of the bomb. He draws a small cross on one of the random papers in the bowl for the draw. After distributing the pieces of paper, Svan realizes that none of the team members agrees to reveal the brave one, fulfilling his duty to the people of Venus. The current political situation scares the six conspirators to attempt their expedition. After a fight with the guard, Svan and his team successfully make their way to the ship, but a second bomb turns out to be in Svan's possession and put into the car of his subordinates. Not only does Svan plan to explode the colonizers' ship, but also to take out revenge on his crew. As soon as he thinks of killing two birds with one stone: the Earth colonizers and five traitors, one of the team members Ingra, kisses Svan before going on board and wishes him good luck. Svan is thrown into a shudder, realizing that he is making a fatal mistake. As a result of his confusion, both bombs explode: in his pocket and the car of his accomplices. \nDying on the table of an Earth surgeon on the ship he was trying to destroy, Svan overhears a conversation between the Watch assistant Lowry and the doctor. While examining his clothes, he finds a piece of paper with two marked crosses as a symbol that Svan framed himself because of his fiery and distrustful temper."

We have to conclude\nthat Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now\nfound. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout\nthis section of the Milky Way.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across\nthousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"\ncommented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n  \n \n  \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the\nresult of parallel evolution\u2014not when a hundred human races are\ninvolved, and\n   \n   only\n   \n  the human race.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his\nribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories\nabout himself.\"\n  \n \n  It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous\nthough not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization as\nhigh as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were\nothers\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got\ntogether\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n  \n \n  Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be\nvery useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in\nhelping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating\nprinciple?\" asked Sam Halden.\n  \n \n  \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is\nthat humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.\nWe've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary\nrace F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is\nfertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever\ntheir positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but\nwas a little further along. When we project back into time those star\nsystems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain\npattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n  \n \n  The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color\nchange was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he\nwas interested.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the\nstars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion\nof it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n  \n \n  He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're\nlooking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is\ntoday and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,\nfor purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.\nThere was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky\nWay is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain\ntogether, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we\ncalculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n  \n \n  Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped\nthe motion.\n  \n \n  \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n  \n \n  There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly\nequal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't\nclose, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n  \n \n  Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n  \n \n  \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n  \n \n  \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are\nhumans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate\nwith those they were adjacent to\n   \n   two hundred thousand years ago\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"\nmurmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that\nsatisfies the calculations?\"\n  \n \n  \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something\nthat might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a\nrepresentative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have\nother ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other\nmammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.\nThe evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the\ntime right.\"\n  \n \n  Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two\nends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n  \n \n  \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic\nlight-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a\nfast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our\nexploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it\nthis trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the\nvisionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.\n\"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n  \n \n  \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd\nbetter ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n  \n \n  Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn\nwas the most advanced human type present, but while there were\ndifferences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't\nas great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in\nthe fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or\nlower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And\nthere was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and\nthis was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some\nrespect.\n  \n \n  The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of\nyour pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give\nhim. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four\nmonths to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told\nus that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We\nhave men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region\nwe're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to\nhave an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational\nability.\"\n  \n \n  Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other\nplans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency\nsuch as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are\nthe incentives?\"\n  \n \n  Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the\nRibboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per\ncent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the\nprofits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,\n\"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,\nyou'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound\nroll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n  \n \n  They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n  \n \n  \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take\nyou all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that\nI'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly\neverywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.\"\n  \n \n  There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the\nintegrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n  \n \n  \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it\nfor me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his\nribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the\nregion toward which we're heading.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  DOUBLECROSS\n  \n \n  by JAMES Mac CREIGH\n  \n \n  Revolt was brewing on Venus, led by the\n   \n  descendant of the first Earthmen to\n   \n  land.

The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\nlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\nturned.\n  \n \n  \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented.\n  \n \n  The OD nodded. \"I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said.\n\"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\nready to lift as soon as they come back.\"\n  \n \n  The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \"\n   \n   If\n   \n  they come back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there any question?\"\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged. \"I don't know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny\nplace. I don't trust the natives.\"\n  \n \n  Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they're human beings,\njust like us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't\neven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins\u2014I don't like them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate\nthemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.\"\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\noutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\nVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\nwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\nguards.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there's a minority who are afraid\nof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\nThey think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\nknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground\ngroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\nnative Venusians\u2014the descendants of the first expedition, that\nis\u2014right down into the mud. Well\u2014\" he laughed\u2014\"maybe they will.\nAfter all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic\nvoice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments\nreports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\n  \n \n  Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\nstared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\nenough, it was glowing red\u2014might have been glowing for minutes. He\nsnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\n\"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But\neven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\nand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\n  \n \n  The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story happens on Venus. Venus is a habitable planet with a thick layer of clouds. There are two species on Venus, one is Venusians, who are the descendants of the first generation Earthmen coming to Venus, and the other is Earthmen, who come later as a delegation to collaborate with Venusians for the future colonies. \n\nThe story happens in the background of the disharmony between Earthmen and part of the Venusians. There is a secret Venusian group called the Council, where the members fear that the future Earthmen colonies will harm them and deprive them of their living spaces. Therefore, to not let the Earthmen ship bring back the news of the habitability of Venus, the Council orders Svan as a leader to conduct some rebellious plan, which starts the story.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is located on the planet venus.The planet has been colonized by a group of humans that have settled and adapted to the environment of the planet. The planet seems to be very arid, and is covered by a mist that makes it very hard to see. The planet also has a swamp, which is where the natives were supposed to drop their car after dropping off Svan. The planet doesn\u2019t have a moon, which allows for perfect darkness for the natives to attack the ship. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in the future. All characters are on Venus, where a delegation from Earth recently landed. At the beginning, two officers talk in the ship\u2019s lock. The Exec claims that the Venusians - the descendants of the first expedition that came here approximately a century ago - are not particularly friendly or fully human. Lowry - the Officer of the Deck - explains that many of them are scared of what immigrants from Earth can do with them, admitting that a negative outcome is possible. His speech is interrupted by a voice that tells them a spy ray is focused on the main lock. They are being listened to by six members of an underground group called the Council, who decide to plant a bomb in the ship to kill the delegation on its way back. They drive along the main street of the native town and eventually get stopped by a State Guard. Svan kills him, and they continue driving. At the same time, the two officers are at the bow of the ship, discussing the situation. Soon, when Ingra and the others drive off and then quickly come back for Svan, the car explodes. Its five passengers die, and Svan loses consciousness. The story ends with the surgeon examining Svan\u2019s wounds that turn out to be lethal. He also shows Lowry, who just deactivated the second bomb he had taken from Svan, a slip with two crosses, which he finds puzzling.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The story unfolds on Venus after humans settled on the planet many generations ago. As a result, these humans have transformed to fit Venus' volatile climate, changing their appearance. The setting opens on the Earthling colonizer spaceship. One may recognize the wooden shacks on the town's outskirts visible from the deck. While dusk was gathering and the underground organization was preparing for an attack, fog covered the swampy area of Venus. Rows of guards lined up around the Earth ship. They were keeping the machine safe from a hundred-yard distance away from it, scaring local onlookers with old-fashioned rifles, who came to be surprised by the ship. As soon as dusk deepened and a misty haze fell on the planet, six oppositionists moved towards the anticipated battle. They were illuminating the narrow and pale road with the yellowish headlights of the trailer. They noticed the twisted vegetation of the surrounding jungle. As they moved, the rain intensified, but the downpour was supposed to subside before midnight. The rain was still drizzling over the marshy area, but this did not prevent Svan from putting his plan into action despite Ingra's persuasions to drown the car in the swamp and create a commotion. As Svan headed toward the midnight road, the ground rose, and the jungle thinned. Looking into the distance, the bright lights of an Earth ship flickered in the rainclouds, landing in the center of a clearing created by its ferocious rockets. Seeing the whirling figures of the sentries, Svan realized they were the ship's guards. Despite their thin-shaft blasters, they wouldn't be as easy to defeat as the natives. He could only board by deception."

It's\ntrue that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion\ncan never replace practice in an art.

        "Summary_1": "The story first begins discussing how food is a central topic for men on ships. The Marsmen are called Slimeheads, honoring in their title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that open the road to the wider space without by filling the spaces within. The Ship\u2019s Cook is described to be the most vital man on a spacer because he is the one who turns offal into eatables. There are also instances described where the cooks have messed up and created disasters for fellow crew members, such as poisoning them. Paul Vilanova, the narrator, goes on to tell what happened on the Charles Partlow Sale. The ship is to take a low-energy route and carries various seeds of plantlife. There are the Registry minimum of six men and three officers aboard, including Paul the surgeon, Willy Winkelmann the captain, and Robert Bailey the cook. The cook is responsible for the livelihood of all the men on the ship, and the algae also helped feed the men in a way where they cannot afford the luxury of squeamishness. Although Paul is the surgeon, he rarely lifts a knife in space because his duties are more in line with serving as a morale officer and wailing-wall. Captain Winkelman is described to have a heart of helium ice and is extremely unpopular. Bailey is often his target, but he tries his best as the Ship Cook to feed everybody in a way that makes the algae somewhat appetizing. Paul admits that he does not like the Captain much, but he tells Bailey that his cooking is what keeps the captain retaining his plump figure. Bailey cooks them a luxurious meal the next day, but the captain only criticizes him. Bailey tries to ask what Captain Winkelman wants from him, and even Paul says that he is going to crack from being driven so hard. The Captain tells him that he is simply trying to widen Bailey\u2019s horizons in terms of cooking. Bailey tries to avoid the Captain during meal time after, and Paul believes that he is the finest cook to go into the Hohmann orbit. Even though everybody is impressed by his dishes, Winkelmann still refuses to compliment him despite gaining weight from eating. When Bailey tries to convince the Captain of his food again, Winkelmann takes out a bottle of ketchup to eat with his meal. Bailey is furious, while Paul tries to cheer him up over some fifty cc\u2019s of rye. After the therapeutic drinking, Bailey begins to cook awful looking and tasting dishes. Winkelman, ironically, tells Bailey that he is improving even though the other crew members complain. When Paul goes to visit Bailey again later, one of the crew members exclaims that the cook has managed to make the algae taste similar to real food. Paul tells him that this is the result of the Captain\u2019s continuous pushing; he answers that he does like the Captain when Bailey asks him again. ",
        "Summary_2": "This story follows several men aboard the Ship, specifically focused on the Ship\u2019s Cook Bailey, the Captain Willy Winkelmann and the narrator of the story, the Ship\u2019s Surgeon Paul Vilanova. The story chronicles the importance of food in space, in particular, the trials of the Ship\u2019s Cook in making delectable food out of ship-offal, which all food is made out of. \n\nThe Ship\u2019s Cook, Bailey, is introduced to us as someone who feeds his shipmates by groundside standards. He hides the synthetic and off-putting tastes of the algal repasts with spices like oregano and thyme, and uses his culinary techniques to shape and reuse the offals into mock-meats and other familiar meals. His fellow ship mates are satisfied with the tastes and creativeness of the meals - with none of them losing the typical weight aboard a ship and their Captain Winkelmann, actually, gaining more weight instead. Despite this, the Captain verbalizes his dissatisfaction and criticizes each meal. Every time Bailey ups the ante in the tastes or creativeness of a meal prepared, the Captain\u2019s critique only increases further. The story\u2019s narrator aids the Cook's support and reassures him of the delicious quality of the food he prepares, second to none of the narrator\u2019s past ship experiences. As part of his role in crew morale, the narrator tries to reason with the Captain in driving Bailey too hard, but to no avail. \n\nAt his breaking point, Bailey prepares the ship and the Captain an exquisite steak meal, mimicking its real texture, only to be insulted by the Captain bringing out ketchup and declaring it palpable only with the condiment. Respectfully telling off the Captain, the narrator brings Bailey back to his bunkers and reaches for alcohol as a healing power of nature, again reassuring him and commending him for taking the pressure. The next morning, the crew is served a disgusting pottage of the algae and finally, Bailey receives the Captain\u2019s approval. The narrator is proud, willing to take the bad meals for the rest of the trip in exchange for Bailey overcoming the Captain and gaining his psychic defenses. After a day, the crew mates are rewarded by Bailey\u2019s newest concoction: a barbecued steak that is complimented to actually taste of food and be delicious. The narrator reveals that the Captain\u2019s relentless critique was actually to improve Bailey\u2019s culinary skills and for the good of the ship, and is rewarded with another piece of the artificial steak. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is about the crew of a spaceship that is making their way to Mars. At the beginning, the main character, Paul Vilanova, relates the importance of food in these trips. He says that the cook in a ship has the power to either make a trip or break a trip. On this particular trip, the cook is Robert Bailey. He is very talented, but the captain of the trip believes that he isn't. Throughout the story, the Captain continuously berates Bailey for the lack of quality in his cooking, even though Paul and the rest of the ship are really impressed with the food. Bailey is forced to cook with algae, as it allows for long trips and gives men all the necessary nutrients that they need. When the Captain begins to put ketchup on Bailey\u2019s delicacies, he takes this as the last straw and begins to lower the quality of the cooking severely. Lastly, Bailey gives a steak that seemed to be perfect, perfectly cooked and a perfect replica of a real steak. It is hinted that this steak is actually human meat, and that Bailey killed the Captain. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story talks about the future in which people are traveling between different planets. The ones that do that are called the spacers. They spend a lot of time in space, and, thus, need to eat a lot. The solution of this future is algae that feed the men and help keep the ship a sustainable system. The narrator of the story is Paul Vilanova, a spacer. Sometime in the past, he traveled to Mars on a ship called The Sale. He was the board surgeon, the captain was Willy Winkelmann - a very unapproachable man. Their cook - the most important person on the ship because he had to apply biochemistry and dietetics to cook nourishing food from Chlorella algae - was called Robert Bailey, he was originally from Ohio. Vilanova describes a very tense relationship between the cook and the captain: Willy Winkelmann, an unpleasant person he was, was always mispronouncing the cook's name and criticizing his dishes. \n\nHe served a three-course dinner and the crew thanked him, but the captain found his food disgusting and left the dinner with a small scandal. Later, Bailey talked to the surgeon about the captain and complained about his insulting remarks. Paul assured him that no one could make Winkelmann happy and that the food was way above average. The next day the captain made an offensive comment about Bailey's cooking abilities again. Paul tried to talk to Winkelmann about his harsh attitude towards Bailey, and the captain said that he believed this attitude would make the cook improvise and experiment more. Paul disagreed but was soon told to leave. Bailey started avoiding the captain but was still called from the kitchen almost every time. The other crew members enjoyed this conflict since it made Bailey cook in a more creative way. One day Paul even learned that instead of taking anything meaningful on the board Winkelmann had just brought a box of ketchup to help him eat the spacers\u2019 food and humiliate Bailey even more. After another offensive monologue from the captain, the cook became angry and started talking back, but Winkelmann quickly excused him and Paul, who had tried to defend Bailey. Later Paul gave the cook some rye and listened to him cursing and insulting the captain. The next morning Bailey cooked something unusually disgusting, and the captain realized he had lost and decided to give the cook a word of praise. Sometime later, Bailey managed to make the best dish he had made so far - the steaks tasted like real food, not the algae. After a small chat, Paul and Bailey both agreed that Winkelmann had significantly contributed to Bailey's success by criticizing his food and driving the cook more eager to prove himself. "

Our\nCaptain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\nperformance out of his Ship's Cook.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\nHe persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\nof the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\nspearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll\nhave to admit that I do.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\nplate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n<doc-sep>\"Doc, do you like Winkelmann?\" the Cook asked me.\n  \n \n  \"Not much,\" I said. \"I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can\ngive his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got\nto live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,\" Bailey said. \"The fat swine!\"\n  \n \n  \"His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,\" I\nsaid. \"He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in\nmy time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It\nwas green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. \"This\nis what I have to work with,\" he said. He tossed the stuff back into\nits bin. \"In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,\nwe'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll never make Winkelmann happy,\" I said. \"Even the simultaneous\ndeath of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up\nthe good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye\nfrom Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook\nwaved my gift aside. \"Not now, Doc,\" he said. \"I'm thinking about\ntomorrow's menu.\"\n  \n \n  The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the\nnext day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed\nwith something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of\nburnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only\nguess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and\ndrying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine\nheads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The\n   \n   pi\u00e8ce de\nr\u00e9sistance\n   \n  was again a \"hamburger steak;\" but this time the algaeal\nmass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only\nfaintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had\nbeen sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. \"It's\nso tender,\" the radioman joked, \"that I can hardly believe it's really\nsteak.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently\nimploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big\nman's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" Winkelmann said, \"I had almost rather you served me\nthis pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and\ncycler-salt.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical\npath to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate\nthe appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned\nby that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at\nmealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. \"Convey my\ncompliments to the Chef, please,\" the Captain would instruct one of\nthe crew, \"and ask him to step down here a moment.\" And the Cook would\ncheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius\nacidly called in question again.\n  \n \n  I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go\ninto Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in\nbrilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an\n   \n   ersatz\n   \n  hot\nturkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella\nturkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy\na grainy and delicious \"cornbread,\" and had extracted from his algae\na lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot \"bread\" with a\ngenuinely dairy smell. \"Splendid, Bailey,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"We are not amused,\" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second\nhelping of the pseudo-turkey. \"You are improving, Belly-Robber, but\nonly arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require\na geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere\nedibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will\nhave learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics\nstudent. That will be all, Bailey.\"\n  \n \n  The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of\nBailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their\nCaptain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark\non an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last\nfew days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many\nmemories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had\nlost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,\nseemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,\nand he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our\nCaptain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice\nthat would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when\nWinkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "One of the first-mentioned dishes that Bailey cooks is hamburger. He tries to create this out of the algae, seasoning the food to hide the flavors. He also serves a fudge for dessert that is compounded from the dextrose-paste of the carbohydrate recycler. After speaking with Paul initially, Bailey serves a dish of hamburger steak again. There is an individual head of lettuce served, along with a steak drenched in gravy. Later, he serves them a hot turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce is very believable, whereas the turkey is white and tender even though it is made from Chlorella. When Captain Winkelmann pushes Bailey too far, he begins to create disgusting foods. One of the first dishes he serves is boiled Chlorella vulgaris that resembles vomit. The coffee at noon also tastes of salt. However, at the very end of the story, Bailey succeeds in making his Chlorella steak actually taste like food.",
        "Summary_2": "The dishes Bailey cooks for the crew varies greatly, ranging from artificial vegetables to mock-meats. One dish that he makes is a mock-meat hamburger, with the pressed Chlorella tinted pink and seasoned by oregano and thyme. The dish is accompanied by dessert - a fudge made from dextrose-paste. More mock-meat dishes include a hamburger steak covered in a rich, meaty gravy lavishly seasoned with garlic. \n\nAnother dish includes a mock individual head of lettuce dressed with vinegar and oil. The lettuce was made by Bailey constructing each synthetic lettuce leaf, with the narrator guessing the process to be out of pressing, rolling and shaping a green Chlorella paste. \n\nIn contrast to some of the delicious dishes that Bailey makes, the Cook also delivers some less tasty meals in response to the Captain\u2019s critiques. These included boiled Chlorella vulgaris in some soup and subpar algaeburgers. \n\nBailey\u2019s final dish in the story - and the best one yet - is an artificial steak that greets the crew with a barbecue smell. It is drenched with gravy and seasoned with a peppery and garlicy taste, and as the crew eats it, they find that the usually pond-scum taste that accompanies each repurposed chlorella meal is gone and instead, the taste and texture reflects actual steak. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Throughout their trip, Bailey does the best he can in order to replicate traditional food using the Algae. To impress the Captain, Bailey cooks a wide variety of foods including algae burgers, fudge, Steak with gravy and a head of lettuce, Hot turkey with cornbread and butter sauce, and medium rare steak. None of these foods impressed the Captain, so Bailey went back to cooking unappealing food such as a porridge-like broth and bad coffee. At the end, Bailey serves a new type of steak, which is hinted to be human steak from the Captain.",
        "Summary_4": "Bailey made a lot of different dishes while working on the Sale ship. He cooked a hamburger and a fudge. He made a steak with rich meat gravy and lettuce, vinegar, and oil. An ersatz hot turkey supreme with a cheese sauce, cornbread, and a pottage was also served at some point. All of these were criticized by Captain Winkelmann. Mostly Bailey was working on the taste of steak, which at the end of the story, he managed to perfect to a certain extent, partly thanks to the captain\u2019s constant remarks. "

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>There being only three seats in the\n   \n   Sale's\n   \n  mess compartment, we ate\nour meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to\nsupper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell\nto make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,\nof cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss\nof canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the\nfirst-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"\n  \n \n  \"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman\nsaid.\n  \n \n  I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric\nwarming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of\nus with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried\nChlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched\nin a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron\nskillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut\na bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are\nlimits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the\ngalley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\"\nI said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is\nactually\n   \n   good\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.\n  \n \n  I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but\nthis is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;\nyou couldn't have done it without him.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\"\nBailey asked.\n  \n \n  \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our\nCaptain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum\nperformance out of his Ship's Cook.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.\nHe persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good\nof the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked,\nspearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll\nhave to admit that I do.\"\n  \n \n  Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my\nplate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n<doc-sep>\"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\ncomes down the passage?\"\n  \n \n  Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain\nlooked up from his desk, then jumped up.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're doing, busting in here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you're planning a course change, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've got damn big ears.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think we'd better call in at Jorgensen's.\"\n  \n \n  \"You do, huh?\" the captain sat down. \"I'm in command of this vessel,\"\nhe said. \"I'm changing course for Alabaster.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't find it convenient to go to Alabaster,\" Retief said. \"So\njust hold your course for Jorgensen's.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not bloody likely.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your use of the word 'bloody' is interesting, Captain. Don't try to\nchange course.\"\n  \n \n  The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\n  \n \n  \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\nthe desk, gripped the captain's wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he\neased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\ndrawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\n  \n \n  \"You busted it, you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\nhoods.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't put it over, hick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\nhe said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\nthe mike and looked up at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\nto sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\n  \n \n  Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door.\n  \n \n  \"Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's\ngoing on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with\na sick friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\n  \n \n  Retief settled himself in a chair.\n  \n \n  \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I'm going to\nstay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.\"\n  \n \n  The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel\nlike dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don't mind me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.\n  \n \n  \"If anything happens that I don't like,\" he said, \"I'll wake you up.\nWith this.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story is set on the Charles Partlow Sale in outer space. The ship left in the middle of August, and it is due at Piano West in early May. The path to Mars is considered to be as long in time as the human period of gestation. This is because the ship is taking a low-energy route. There are Chlorella tanks on the ship to grow the algae in. There is also a dining compartment with a mess table for the crew members to eat food on. The ship also has a cargo compartment, filled with the seeds of Tien-Shen fir and some tons of arctic grass. However, the ship itself is described to be quite small and cannot carry huge amounts of cargo. ",
        "Summary_2": "This story takes place aboard a ship called the Charles Partlow Sale, which took off from the Brady Station on a low-energy route to Mars, taking about a journey\u2019s time of about 9 months before arrival.\n\nThe setting mainly occurs in the mess hall as the backdrop to the crew\u2019s meal times as they dig into the prepared dishes by the Cook. It is also here where the interactions between the Cook and the Captain take place, often with the Captain ridiculing the Cook\u2019s culinary prowess. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in a spaceship, but the spaceship seems to have very traditional attributes of a sea ship. It has different levels of decks, as well as different rooms that allow for different day to day activities. Most of the story is recounted on the dining table, where Bailey serves the food that he cooks in order for the crew to enjoy. This is also where the Captain berates Bailey constantly for his lack of cooking skill, and where Bailey sits there taking the criticism. The story also takes place in the medbay, where Bailey and Doc share their dislike of the captain. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set in the future where interplanetary trips are normal and regular, specifically, the narrator tells about what was happening on the spaceship called the Sale that had left the Brady Station and was on its way to Mars. Most of the conversations and events of the story happened in the mess, the dining area of the ship. Captain Winkelmann criticized Bailey\u2019s food many times while eating there. Paul, the narrator and the ship\u2019s doctor, and Bailey also went to the medical quarters after they both had a conflict with the captain after he had called the meal a failure. Here they had an emotional talk about the captain, and the next day Bailey cooked a disgusting pottage that proved that Bailey had overcome the captain\u2019s criticism. Sometime later, Paul and Bailey met at the dining area again after the cook had made the best version of steak with a real taste of meat. "

        "Query": "Why is the Chlorella algae crucial for the survival of the crew in the story \"GOURMET\"?",
        "Article": "Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife\nin space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher\nextraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,\nguardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.\nGenerally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim\nis the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.\n  \n \n  If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties\nof his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann\nwas the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do\nso alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have\ndone splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart\nwas a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet\nEarth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as\nWilly Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a\nPullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social\nhemorrhoid.\n  \n \n  The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.\nIt was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, \"Bailey,\nRobert,\" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate\nshipmate \"Belly-Robber.\" It was Winkelmann who discussed\n   \n   haut\ncuisine\n   \n  and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our\nalgaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was\nCaptain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any\nother name than The Kitchen Cabinet.\n  \n \n  Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste\nof synthetic methionine\u2014an essential amino acid not synthesized by\nChlorella\u2014by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano\nand thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,\ntextured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the\nslabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.\nFor dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of\nthe carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.\n\"Belly-Robber,\" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,\n\"you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun\nin my home country:\n   \n   Mensch ist was er isst.\n   \n  It means, you are what\nyou eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this\n   \n   Schweinerei\n   \n  you are feeding me.\" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin\nwith his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the\nladder from the dining-cubby.\n  \n<doc-sep>Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky\nthrough a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting\nexordium of\n   \n   Isaiah\n   \n  36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today\nwhat was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.\n  \n \n  The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning\noffal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a\nspacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.\nSlimeheads remember the H. M. S.\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  fiasco, for example, in which a\ngalleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's\nshielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from\nthe\n   \n   Ajax\n   \n  in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think\nof the\n   \n   Benjo Maru\n   \n  incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed\nhis algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing\n   \n   Saccharomycodes\n   \n  yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at\nPiano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into\nthe stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent\nbite he ate to a superior grade of\n   \n   sake\n   \n  . And for a third footnote to\nthe ancient observation, \"God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,\"\nMarsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the\n   \n   Charles Partlow\nSale\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Sale\n   \n  blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due\nin at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking\nthe low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the\nhuman period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir\nseedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed\u2014these to be planted\nin the\n   \n   maria\n   \n  to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had\naboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's\nSurgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,\nthe hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was\nRobert Bailey.\n  \n \n  Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating\ntensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,\ndietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to\nsee that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of\nwater, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.\nThis isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a\nstatement of the least fuel a man can run on.\n  \n \n  Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo\ncompartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the\n   \n   C. P. Sale\n   \n  no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to\nwork over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons\nof metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West\nand back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,\nprotein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the\nalgae fed us.\n  \n \n  All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble\nfrom our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route\nand back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in\nessential amino acids.\n  \n \n  The algae\u2014dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the\nsmell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a\nhundred ways\u2014served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite\nwore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of\noxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the\nend of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the\nglomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling\npoliticians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a\nbreed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of\nsqueamishness.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  GOURMET\n  \n \n  By ALLEN KIM LANG\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine April 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n \n   This was the endless problem of all\n    \n   spaceship cooks: He had to feed the men\n    \n   tomorrow on what they had eaten today!\n   \n \n \n \n  Unable to get out to the ballgame and a long way off from the girls,\nmen on ships think about, talk about, bitch about their food. It's\ntrue that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion\ncan never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a\nchallenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts\nthat a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list.\n  \n \n  In the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing\nseals, for example, the fo'c's'le hands called themselves Lobscousers,\ncelebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The\nLimey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into\nhis diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age\nonly as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen\nare called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the\n   \n   Chlorella\n   \n  and\n   \n   Scenedesmus\n   \n  algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the\nroad to the larger Space without.\n  \n \n  Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in\nhistory\u2014whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis\nto the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with\ncross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire\u2014he is referred to the\nhundred-and-first chapter of\n   \n   Moby Dick\n   \n  , a book spooled in the\namusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that\nno Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more\nthan a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of\nLeyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a\nman condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Pequod's\n   \n  crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won\ntheir war on canned pork and beans. The\n   \n   Triton\n   \n  made her underwater\nperiplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and\nconcentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the\nskies, a decline set in.\n  \n \n  The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent\nfood. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings\nfrom aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the\ngroundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Chlorella algae is what keeps all of the crew members alive for the duration of the journey. Since twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the compartment to bursting, Chlorella algae is the solution to this. It can work over used food, air, and effluvia, three tons of metabolites that would see them through the entire round trip. Everything the crew recycles is fed to the algae, which feeds the crew members in return. The waste is used to fertilize the liquid fields. Even their stubble from 2,600 shaves and clipping from 666 haircuts is used to feed the algae because human hair is rich in essential amino acids. The algae is their food, as well as the water and air that keeps the crew members going. ",
        "Summary_2": "The chlorella algae is integral to the story as well as the shipmen. On each ship, a colony of chlorella algae is introduced in order to recycle through the used air, water and other effluvia that the crewmates both used and wasted. Everything that couldn\u2019t feed the crew like molecules of fat, minerals, carbohydrates etc were used to feed the algae, and in return, the Cook would use the algae offcuts and pastes to feed the crew. It served its purpose both as the key sustenance for the crewmates as well as an important part of the recycling process aboard the ship. \n\nThroughout the story, it also serves as an important piece of the Cook overcoming the challenge of working with algae. In every dish, despite his creativity and seasonings, the taste and look of algae - tasting like pond-scum and green - will be present in some way. By the end of the story, however, the Cook has been able to tenderize and shape the algae\u2019s texture in such a way that it mimics real meat. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Chlorella algae is what the cook uses to make his food. The algae works over the air that the crew doesn\u2019t use, and is also fed with waste from the ship, including hair and human waste as fertilizer. The algae was then cooked by the chef to feed the crew and create a cycle that allows the ship to do long voyages. The algae tastes very bad, and requires a lot of cooking effort to make it somewhat edible, which is what Bailey did. Bailey managed to replicate traditional dishes very well using the algae, but it wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy the Captain. ",
        "Summary_4": "Chlorella algae were important because they allowed the spaceship and its crew members to get to their destination without bringing tons of food and gear with them. It worked over the used air, the crew\u2019s water, other effluvia, and types of waste; and extracted different proteins, minerals, and fat from it, feeding itself. And the algae, on the other hand, served as the main food ingredient for the spacers that spent months on a spaceship. The algae - served in different ways and with various dressings - were practically the main dish every day. Water and oxygen were recycled, too.\n"

Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n  \n \n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n  \n \n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n  \n \n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n  \n \n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n  \n \n  His mind flexed.\n  \n \n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n  \n \n  The cliff groaned.\n  \n \n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n  \n \n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n  \n \n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n  \n \n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n  \n \n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n  \n \n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n  \n \n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n  \n \n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n  \n \n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n  \n \n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n  \n \n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n  \n \n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n  \n \n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n  \n \n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n  \n \n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n  \n \n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n  \n \n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n  \n \n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n  \n \n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n  \n \n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n  \n \n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability.\n  \n<doc-sep>He kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean if you\n   \n   could\n   \n  hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup\u2014I want to think.\"\n  \n \n  \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n  \n \n  The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n  \n \n  \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n  \n \n  \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet\n   \n   you\n   \n  didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've never been inside the Time Theater\u2014you're not old enough\nyet\u2014so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n  \n \n  \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n  \n \n  \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep\n   \n   telling\n   \n  me about it, do you?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Simon goes to his desk as Betty remarks that he is late. He tells her that he needs a vacation, but she asks him where the funds will come from and her weekly salary. Suddenly, the door knocks, and a man named Mr. Oyster comes in. Despite having never met before, he is impressed that Simon knows him and asks the other man if he believes in time travel. Betty says it is impossible, and Mr. Oyster questions her about why. Simon then asks why he came, to which the potential client responds that he wants them to hunt up some time travelers. He asks Betty some more about science fiction and explains that he is willing to gamble his fortune to investigate the presence of time travelers in the current era. Mr. Oyster further says that these time travelers will be at the Oktoberfest in Munich, which is considered the greatest festival globally. Simon says that he is not interested in taking up the case. Betty is surprised, and Mr. Oyster tries to offer him a substantial amount of money. Simon then tells them a story where he accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s offer. Simon thinks about how much fun he will have and a fake report to generate for Mr. Oyster. He then goes on to be suspicious about how five million people can appear to attend a festival in a remote part of southern Germany, especially considering the population of Munich is less than one million. There is no hotel space in Munch, so Simon must go to Bahnhof to apply for hotel service. It is suspicious how the five million attendees are accommodated for this festival. The circus-like tents represent the seven major brewers of the Munich area, and many people are going around. Simon finds a space at one of the tables; he notes that the crowd is made up of both tourists and Germans. A bald-headed person and he both drink beer. The bald man accidentally reveals that his pencil is Venusian and tells Simon that his dream is to sample each of the seven best beer brands. The man then introduces himself as Arth and tells Simon that he is from a strange location. Arth offers to take him to his hotel later, and Simon goes with him. Arth gives him a box of pills for his hangover, and the scene cuts to them drinking at the festival again. Simon feels that something is off and decides to go back to New York. He returns to the office, where Mr. Oyster tells him that Betty has just finished the receipt. They are both confused and say that he has only been gone for about three minutes. Mr. Oyster is furious and leaves, while Betty asks why he didn\u2019t just take the money. Simon tells her that he experienced the trip three times and says that he will not be dealing with a fourth hangover on top of the three already-present ones. ",
        "Summary_2": "One day, Mr. Oyster comes to Simon\u2019s office and tries to assign a mission of finding a time traveler in a huge festival, Oktoberfest, in Munich and bring back the secret of eternal youth. However, Simon refuses his request. While Mr. Oyster is confused about why Simon rejects such a large amount of money and a chance to go on a vacation, Simon tells him a story.\n\nIn the story, Simon accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and goes to Oktoberfest. When he gets to Munich, he cannot find a hotel to stay in since there are too many people to be accommodated. While drinking in the big tent held by the local brewery, Simon meets a guy who wants to try all the beer. He then accompanies him to drink. When they get drunk, Simon tells the guy that he doesn\u2019t have anywhere to stay, and the guy invites him to his place. While they talk in the guy\u2019s place, the guy carelessly leaks information about where he comes from, which seems like a time traveler. On the following day, when the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he tells Simon not to move and goes into the bathroom. After he comes out, he gives Simon a pill and lets him go. When Simon takes the flight back to his office, the time seems to be reset to when he just left the office to catch the flight to Munich.\n\nMr. Oyster thinks that Simon tries to ridicule him through his story, so he angrily leaves. Betty, Simon\u2019s clerk, asks Simon why he didn\u2019t want to accept the request, and Simon tells her that the story is what truly happened. Moreover, it has already happened three times, but they never believe him as they cannot sense the time reset. In the end, Betty cannot understand what Simon is trying to say, and Simon is also too tired to explain it. The only thing sure is that he will not make the whole trip again.\n",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows Simon and Betty, his assistant, who are two investigators. As Simon nurses a headache and Betty laments over making enough for a week\u2019s salary, a new client enters, an old man wearing an expensive suit. Identifying the old man by name - Mr. Oyster - he details his desire to investigate time travel. Insisting that time travel is possible and real, with all the paradoxes explained away, Mr. Oyster passionately hypothesizes that time travelers often congregate at events like Oktoberfest and propose for Simon and Betty to attend the festival and nab a time traveler. Simon expands on the latter\u2019s desire as to him wanting the investigators to exhort from the time traveler some secret of eternal youth, and hence be willing to pay a premium rate of upwards of fifty thousand dollars. Despite this generous amount, Simon declines, and instead tells the pair a story. \n\nThe story goes: he took a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster as an advance and departed on the first flight out to Germany. When he arrived at the festival, Simon found an available space in a brewers tent. He sat down across a bald-headed man who appeared to be noting down the various beers being tried. Introducing himself as Arth, Simon and Arth end up traversing the rest of the festival\u2019s breweries together, getting more and more inebriated with each one. After a while, both of them head back to Arth\u2019s hotel and pass out. The next morning, Arth is surprised to find Simon and gives him a pill to help with Simon\u2019s hangover. In the next scene, Simon finds them the next day back at the festival, nursing another mug of beer. With a terrible hangover and not remembering the details of the previous night, Simon says his goodbyes and heads to pick up his luggage, only to find it lost. He decided to head to the airport and fly out without it, found himself with a momentary bump with a ticketing error, and went directly to his office after landing. At the office, Simon is surprised to find Mr. Oyster there, surmising that he is eager to get the report. However, as Betty expresses that she just met Mr. Oyster that morning, he soon realizes that he somehow indeed time traveled. \n\nWhen Simon finished telling his story, Mr. Oyster is in disbelief and believes that he is being ridiculed and storms out of the office, leaving behind fifty dollars for the investigator's time. Betty comments that he is surprised he didn\u2019t take the offer. Simon reveals that he did, actually, three times. It turns out that Mr. Oyster\u2019s hypothesis on time travelers\u2019 existence and their congregation at Oktoberfest was correct. However, these time travelers - like Arth - will immediately reset the track if the space-time continuum was threatened - like they did to Simon. Nursing several hangovers, Simon implores Betty to let it go.\n",
        "Summary_4": "This story centers around two private investigators, Betty and Simon. Betty seems to be working under Simon, and asks Simon for her payment. They have a little disagreement, but it ends when a new client arrives. The client is Mr. Oyster, an old and rich man who is looking to find time travelers and is willing to pay handsomely. After the 3 of them go back and forth debating about the existence of time travel, Simon starts to tell a story about him going to Oktoberfest, and how an entanglement with a time traveler could go. The story starts with Simon arriving at the festival, and immediately becomes friends with a time traveler, Arth. After drinking together, they end up going to Arth\u2019s hotel. When Simon wakes up, he is in a very futuristic room. When Arth notices him, he gives him a pill and then Simon wakes up in the Oktoberfest again. Arth tells him it is the day after, but Simon ends up going back to New York. When he gets there, he arrives not 10 minutes later after he left. After the story ends, he rejects Mr. Oyster\u2019s proposal and it is revealed the story was real, and that Simon had in fact gone to the future with Arth, and had found time travelers. "

It goes like\nthis:\"\n  \n \n \n  I got a thousand dollars from Mr.\nOyster (Simon began) in the way\nof an advance, and leaving him with\nBetty who was making out a receipt,\nI hustled back to the apartment and\npacked a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation\nanyway, this was a natural. On\nthe way to Idlewild I stopped off at\nthe Germany Information Offices for\nsome tourist literature.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly three and a half\nhours to get to Gander from Idlewild.\nI spent the time planning the\nfun I was going to have.\n  \n \n  It takes roughly seven and a half\nhours from Gander to Shannon and\nI spent that time dreaming up material\nI could put into my reports to\nMr. Oyster. I was going to have to\ngive him some kind of report for his\nmoney. Time travel yet! What a\nlaugh!\n  \n \n  Between Shannon and Munich a\nfaint suspicion began to simmer in\nmy mind. These statistics I read on\nthe\n   \n   Oktoberfest\n   \n  in the Munich tourist\npamphlets. Five million people\nattended annually.\n  \n \n  Where did five million people\ncome from to attend an overgrown\nfestival in comparatively remote\nSouthern Germany? The tourist season\nis over before September 21st,\nfirst day of the gigantic beer bust.\nNor could the Germans account for\nany such number. Munich itself has\na population of less than a million,\ncounting children.\n  \n \n  And those millions of gallons of\nbeer, the hundreds of thousands of\nchickens, the herds of oxen. Who\nponied up all the money for such expenditures?\nHow could the average\nGerman, with his twenty-five dollars\na week salary?\n  \n \n  In Munich there was no hotel\nspace available. I went to the Bahnhof\nwhere they have a hotel service\nand applied. They put my name\ndown, pocketed the husky bribe,\nshowed me where I could check my\nbag, told me they'd do what they\ncould, and to report back in a few\nhours.\n  \n \n  I had another suspicious twinge.\nIf five million people attended this\nbeer bout, how were they accommodated?\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Theresienwiese\n   \n  , the fair\nground, was only a few blocks\naway. I was stiff from the plane ride\nso I walked.\n ",
        "Summary_1": "Oktoberfest, as described by Mr. Oyster, is held in Munich. It is the greatest festival the world has ever seen; each brewery opens a tremendous tent on the fairgrounds, holding five thousand customers apiece. There are millions of liters of beer, hundreds of thousands of barbecued chickens, oxen roasted over spits, millions of pairs of weisswurst sausage, and millions of pretzels. Since there are many people at Oktoberfest, it is perfect for strange people to blend in since nobody will notice. Oktoberfest is also mentioned to start on a Friday and continues for sixteen days. In Simon\u2019s story, the seven major brewers of the Munich area are all represented by circus-like tents. Each tent contains benches and tables that can seat up to five thousand people. There is a tremendous bandstand in the tent's center, where the musicians are lederhosen-clad. The music is described to be Bavarian as well. It is described that there are many desperate waitresses as well, scrambling around and handing people masses of beer. In terms of people, it is extremely loud and crowded; tourists and German natives are all present and try to squeeze into the tents. ",
        "Summary_2": "Oktoberfest is an annual festival held in Munich, the biggest one that has ever been seen. Five million people attend annually. It originates from celebrating a wedding of some local princes about a century and a half ago. Since then, Bavarians have maintained such a tradition. The Munich breweries will have a special beer called Marzenbr\u00e4u. Each brewery will set up a circus-like tent that allows five thousand customers to stay. Each tent contains benches and tables, and there will be a music band in each tent. A tremendous amount of beer, barbecued chicken, and pretzels will be provided. Foods like weisswurst, a special sausage, and roasted oxen will also be in plenty. The whole event usually lasts for sixteen days. People will drink beers and enjoy the food from one tent to another.",
        "Summary_3": "Oktoberfest is a famed beer festival that takes place in Southern Germany, beginning on September 21st and running for sixteen consecutive days. As described by Mr. Oyster, its historical origins began as a celebration of the wedding of a local prince centuries ago, and have since continued as a great time. Each year, many Munich breweries will brew a special batch - Marzenbrau beer - and will erect tents that can hold up to five thousand people. \n\nIn Simon\u2019s own experience, Oktoberfest just like Mr. Oyster described. Simon marvels - and questions - at the fact that five million people come to attend Oktoberfest, when the population of Munich itself does not go over a million. Because of the large number of event attendees, Simon is unable to find hotel space in Munich and has to go to Bahnhof and be put on the waitlist for a room. He finds seven major brewers in the Munich area, arranged in circus-like tents as described, with Bavarian musicians playing. Alongside the mugs of beer, fellow festival go-ers are also enjoying platters of chicken, sausage, kraut and pretzels. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Oktoberfest is described as the greatest festival in the world. It is said that over 5 million people attend the festival in southern Germany yearly, which Simon considers to be weird, as he wonders where those many people come from. The festival has different tents and is full of food and loud music where people get drunk and have a good time. The festival is also described as super packed, as Simon and Arth had a lot of trouble finding chairs in the tents. "

        "Article": "\n  Somewhere along in here the fog\nrolled in. When it rolled out again,\nI found myself closing one eye the\nbetter to read the lettering on my\nearthenware mug.

Bright, glaring, awful daylight.\nI was sprawled, complete with\nclothes, on one of twin beds. On the\nother bed, also completely clothed,\nwas Arth.\n  \n \n  That sun was too much. I stumbled\nup from the bed, staggered to\nthe window and fumbled around for\na blind or curtain. There was none.\n  \n \n  Behind me a voice said in horror,\n\"Who ... how ... oh,\n   \n   Wodo\n   \n  ,\nwhere'd you come from?\"\n  \n \n  I got a quick impression, looking\nout the window, that the Germans\nwere certainly the most modern, futuristic\npeople in the world. But I\ncouldn't stand the light. \"Where's\nthe shade,\" I moaned.\n  \n \n  Arth did something and the window\nwent opaque.\n  \n \n  \"That's quite a gadget,\" I groaned.\n\"If I didn't feel so lousy, I'd\nappreciate it.\"\n  \n \n  Arth was sitting on the edge of\nthe bed holding his bald head in his\nhands. \"I remember now,\" he sorrowed.\n\"You didn't have a hotel.\nWhat a stupidity. I'll be phased.\nPhased all the way down.\"\n  \n \n  \"You haven't got a handful of\naspirin, have you?\" I asked him.\n  \n \n  \"Just a minute,\" Arth said, staggering\nerect and heading for what\nundoubtedly was a bathroom. \"Stay\nwhere you are. Don't move. Don't\ntouch anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" I told him plaintively.\n\"I'm clean. I won't mess up the\nplace. All I've got is a hangover, not\nlice.\"\n  \n \n  Arth was gone. He came back in\ntwo or three minutes, box of pills in\nhand. \"Here, take one of these.\"\n  \n \n  I took the pill, followed it with a\nglass of water.\n <doc-sep>\n  And went out like a light.\n  \n \n  Arth was shaking my arm. \"Want\nanother\n   \n   mass\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The band was blaring, and five\nthousand half-swacked voices were\nroaring accompaniment.\n  \n \n  In Muenchen steht ein Hofbr\u00e4uhaus!\n  \n \n \n  Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!\n  \n \n \n  At the\n   \n   G'sufa\n   \n  everybody upped\nwith their king-size mugs and drank\neach other's health.\n  \n \n  My head was killing me. \"This is\nwhere I came in, or something,\" I\ngroaned.\n  \n \n  Arth said, \"That was last night.\"\nHe looked at me over the rim of his\nbeer mug.\n  \n \n  Something, somewhere, was\nwrong.

Oh, my head.\nWhere did we spend last night?\"\n  \n \n  Arth said, and his voice sounded\ncautious, \"At my hotel, don't you remember?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not very well,\" I admitted. \"I\nfeel lousy.

There were no hotel rooms\navailable in Munich. The head was\ngetting worse by the minute. The\nfact that they'd somehow managed\nto lose my bag didn't help. I worked\non that project for at least a couple\nof hours. Not only wasn't the bag\nat the luggage checking station, but\nthe attendant there evidently couldn't\nmake heads nor tails of the check\nreceipt. He didn't speak English and\nmy high school German was inadequate,\nespecially accompanied by a\nblockbusting hangover.\n  \n \n  I didn't get anywhere tearing my\nhair and complaining from one end\nof the Bahnhof to the other. I drew\na blank on the bag.\n  \n \n  And the head was getting worse\nby the minute. I was bleeding to\ndeath through the eyes and instead\nof butterflies I had bats in my stomach.\nBelieve me,\n   \n   nobody\n   \n  should drink\na gallon or more of Marzenbr\u00e4u.\n <doc-sep>\n  There are seven major brewers in\nthe Munich area, each of them represented\nby one of the circuslike tents\nthat Mr. Oyster mentioned.

In the center\nis a tremendous bandstand, the\nmusicians all\n   \n   lederhosen\n   \n  clad, the\nmusic as Bavarian as any to be found\nin a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of\npeasant garbed\n   \n   fr\u00e4uleins\n   \n  darted about\nthe tables with quart sized earthenware\nmugs, platters of chicken, sausage,\nkraut and pretzels.\n  \n \n  I found a place finally at a table\nwhich had space for twenty-odd beer\nbibbers. Odd is right. As weird an\nassortment of Germans and foreign\ntourists as could have been dreamed\nup, ranging from a seventy- or\neighty-year-old couple in Bavarian\ncostume, to the bald-headed drunk\nacross the table from me.\n  \n \n  A desperate waitress bearing six\nmugs of beer in each hand scurried\npast. They call them\n   \n   masses\n   \n  , by the\nway, not mugs. The bald-headed\ncharacter and I both held up a finger\nand she slid two of the\n   \n   masses\n   \n  over\nto us and then hustled on.\n  \n \n  \"Down the hatch,\" the other said,\nholding up his\n   \n   mass\n   \n  in toast.\n  \n \n  \"To the ladies,\" I told him. Before\nsipping, I said, \"You know, the\ntourist pamphlets say this stuff is\neighteen per cent.

Where's\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  Arth thought about it. Took another\nlong pull at the beer. \"Right\nacross the way from old Albuquerque,\"\nhe said finally. \"Maybe we\nought to be getting on to the\nPschorrbr\u00e4u tent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we ought to eat something\nfirst,\" I said. \"I'm beginning to feel\nthis.

Ugh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we need some nourishment,\"\nI said.\n  \n \n  \"There's supposed to be considerable\nnourishment in beer.\"\n  \n \n  That made sense.

        "Summary_1": "Arth is a bald man at Oktoberfest. He is first introduced as a bald-headed drunk who sits across from Simon. They share a beer together and toast. After, Arth makes a note to write down the name engraved on his mug in a small notebook with a pencil. When Simon asks if he is German, Arth accidentally responds that his pencil is Venusian. Arth is very determined to fulfill his pilgrimage of trying every single beer at Oktoberfest, but he is disappointed that he will never make it. Simon asks him where he is from when they go to another tent, and Arth responds that he is from 2183 South St in New Albuquerque; it is situated right across Old Albuquerque. Arth also has a kind side to him, as he offers to take Simon to his hotel to rest for the night. He even offers Simon a box of pills to help with his hangover. When they go back to drinking again, he looks at Simon cautiously when the latter does not remember where he spent the night. Arth looks at Simon strangely as he goes back, even though he is initially portrayed as a friendly and kind bald man. ",
        "Summary_2": "According to Simon's story, Arth is a time traveler that Simon meets in Oktoberfest. He is bald. He has a small notebook and a Venusian pencil in his pocket. He is from 2183 South Street, New Albuquerque. He is a vegetarian. He meets Simon, a detective who comes to Oktoberfest to search for time travelers, in a tent in Oktoberfest. He invites Simon to go to his place when he knows that Simon has no place to stay. He resets the time when he wakes up the following morning and realizes that he may leak information about his identity to Simon. He gives Simon a pill and sends him out after resetting the time.",
        "Summary_3": "Arth is a fellow Oktoberfest go-er that Simon meets at one the brewery tents, who is on a pilgrimage to try every beer from the seven best brands, but has only made it so far as the Lowenbrau beer. He and Simon set off together as a pair to try the rest of the beers. In making conversation, we find out that Arth often slips in what he says. For example, when writing down the beers he is trying, Simon inquires about the odd type of pencil he is using and assumes it is German, but Arth corrects him and says that it is Venusian. As an afterthought, Arth says that he should not have said that. Similarly, when Simon asks where Arth is from, Arth simply says \u20182183\u2019 before correcting it to a supposed street address in New Albuquerque. \n\nAfter a couple more beers, Arth brings Simon back to his hotel room as Simon has yet to find one himself. The next morning, Arth expresses regret and stupidity towards himself for bringing Simon back and hands him a pill - supposedly aspirin - for Simon\u2019s hangover. The next day, as Simon continues nursing his hangover, Arth details the memories of last night cautiously to Simon and they end up saying their goodbyes. Overall, Arth appears to marvel at Oktoberfest in an odd way. He also seems to be cautious - oftentimes slipping up with revealing too much or a certain information and regrettably having to correct it. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Arth is described as a bald man, who seems to be very drunk when Simon befriends him at the festival. Throughout the story, it becomes clearer and clearer that Arth is a time traveler. He said he is from 2183, probably referring to his year, as well as referring to his pen as being \u201cvenusian\u201d. Arth is on a pilgrimage to complete the 7 tents within the festival, as he wanted to experience the greatest festival ever. He ends up taking Simon to the future with him, but when he realizes his mistake sends Simon back to the present using a pill. "

        "Summary_1": "Simon works with Betty investigating many cases at their office in New York. He initially has a terrible headache and has to take aspirin for his hangover. He is perceptive as well, knowing who Mr. Oyster is without having seen him before and informative about time travel. However, he does show a stubborn side when he refuses Mr. Oyster\u2019s offer no matter how much money the other man offers him. Even though he could just create a false report for Mr. Oyster, he refuses to take the job. Simon later reveals to Betty that he has already experienced going to Oktoberfest three times and has brought nothing but multiple hangovers back. In the story he tells, Simon is very friendly towards Arth and tries to help him on his pilgrimage. He ends up getting extremely hungover and goes back to New York, which then resets the entire cycle of events again. ",
        "Summary_2": "Simon is a detective who constantly searches for his aspirin bottle. He is weary and tired when Mr. Oyster comes to give a request on hunting a time traveler. He needs a vacation. In his story, he does not find a place to stay, so he leaves his bag in one of the hotels. After he goes into a tent to have some beers, he meets a time traveler in Oktoberfest without knowing the identity of the time traveler. He is invited to the time traveler\u2019s home, and the next day, he is sent out after taking a pill. After leaving the time traveler\u2019s house, he cannot find his bag in the hotel since there is no check receipt to show that his bag has been stored there. His flight ticket also has a weird, wrong date. When he gets back to the office, he realizes that he goes back to when he had just left to catch the flight. He tries to tell other people that he has the same experience as the story, but no one believes him.",
        "Summary_3": "Simon, the protagonist, is an investigator alongside his assistant, Betty. He is recruited by Mr. Oyster to further investigate and locate a time traveler in Oktoberfest, and exhort a time traveler\u2019s secrets to eternal life in return for a generous sum. Initially described as someone looking to make money, it is surprising that he turns down the opportunity. \n\nHowever, it is revealed through the story that he did initially take the offer. Simon\u2019s disbelief at Mr. Oyster\u2019s insistence of time travelers is attributed as whilst on the plane, Simon plans to embellish and dream up the material in Mr. Oyster\u2019s report. However, he soon begins to have suspicions about the feasibility of such time travelers, as facts like the vast number of people attending Oktoberfest and cost of expenditure in contrast to the location and timing of the festival do not appear to make sense to Simon. \n\nSimon is also described as friendly and open, as he instantly makes conversation with Arth and makes casual conversation with him about his time at Oktoberfest, where he\u2019s from, etc. The two of them fall into an easy companionship and set off to try the rest of the beers together. He is also smart and pragmatic, choosing to cut his losses at Oktoberfest and head back home early. Whilst at the office in discovering that it was the same day as he had supposedly left for Oktoberfest, he demonstrates his intelligence in being able to suss out what had happened to him.  \n",
        "Summary_4": "Simon is a private investigator. He seems to be a very pragmatic person, as he knew exactly what he needed to do in order to get his client happy and comfortable. He also knew how to manage Betty\u2019s expectations, as she wanted him to pay him but he knew what to say in order to make her happy. He also learns from his mistakes, as he already tried to find a time traveler, but he refuses to try again because of the situation that he suffered the first time. \n"

        "Summary_1": "The story that Simon tells relates back to Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request about time travelers because he is the one who time traveled. Although he calls it a funny story, the sequence of events he describes is all actual events he experiences. The entire purpose of Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and his desire to spend a portion of his fortune is to find a time traveler and come to a conclusion that they exist. However, he fails to realize that the very person he is asking has time traveled. Since the events were repeated three times, Simon\u2019s refusal now changes the flow of events in the near future to avoid a fourth hangover. Even though Mr. Oyster leaves angrily, Simon\u2019s story serves as a true report of time traveling and fulfills Mr. Oyster\u2019s request. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request is to find the time traveler in the Oktoberfest in Munich and bring back the secret of eternal youth from them. On the other hand, Simon tells the story about what will happen after accepting the requests and going to Oktoberfest. Simon will not be able to find his accommodation in Munich as there will be too many people to be accommodated. Simon will meet a time traveler and have fun with him. Since they are both drunk, the time traveler will take Simon back to his place and leak some information about the future. On the following day, once the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he will reset the time to where Simon starts and send Simon back. When Simon is back, it will only be him remembering the whole thing. And if Simon tries to tell Mr. Oyster and his clerk about what happened, they will only consider him as ridiculing them since they do not believe the time has been reset. Therefore, the story Simon tells reveals that even if Simon accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and meets a time traveler, he will not be able to bring back the secret of eternal youth but only a severe hangover because the space-time continuum track is not allowed to be changed.",
        "Summary_3": "Simon\u2019s story relates back to Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request to find time travelers because it confirms Mr. Oyster\u2019s theory: that time travelers exist and they do attend Oktoberfest. To us as readers, the meeting between Mr. Oyster and Simon and Betty in the beginning of the story marks the first time all three of them meet. However, Simon\u2019s story tells us the opposite, that it is actually the second or third time Simon has met Mr. Oyster and completed his request, each time nursing a hangover. \n\nWe find out through Simon that while Mr. Oyster was correct in his insistence at the existence of time travelers, he was wrong in thinking that time travelers would give up the secrets of eternal life and threaten the space-time continuum. In fact, we can see from the interactions between Simon and Arth that time travelers will do whatever it takes to reset the timeline and prevent the space-time continuum from being threatened. It is clear through Simon\u2019s repeat experiences with the same meeting, same day, and same hangover that Simon had investigated a little too closely to the time travelers, and as a consequence, returned back to his office on a reset day, with only his hangover and change from the initial thousand dollars as the only witness to the alternate reality. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Simon\u2019s story begins simply as a story of a trip to Germany to the Oktoberfest. Simon recounts his story of how he met a friend, Arth. In the end, we realize that in fact Arth was a time traveler, and that when Simon went to Arth\u2019s hotel it was in fact the future. We learn that at the time of recounting the story to Mr. Oyster, Simon had already gone to the future with Arth. "

        "Summary_1": "Mr. Humphrey Fownes has been pickpocketed eleven times despite the weather being good. This is because he is an uncommonly preoccupied individual and has constantly been thinking about the weather for the entire day. The first person who pickpockets him is a bogus postman who jostles him while pretending to read a postal card. The next person who pickpockets him is a pretty girl who collides with him. The next people are two men who pretend to be in a heated argument. Humphrey continuously thinks about the weather outside; this allows the police to maintain tight surveillance of him. Lanfierre is one of the people in the orange car and thinks about Humphrey Fownes being unique. He tells Lieutenant MacBride that Fownes\u2019 house sometimes shakes, which makes the other man frown. Lanfierre considers MacBride to be a barbarian because he is cynical and cannot appreciate the peculiar nature of Fownes. He goes on to tell him that the windows all close at the same time in the house. MacBride refuses to believe him and tells him to take a rest, but all of the windows close, and the house suddenly begins to shake. They continue to observe the man; Fownes goes into his house and begins to think about his dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway. The house begins to shake more, and he decides that repairs are a must. During his dinner, Mrs. Deshazaway explains how she will never marry again. The widow is a passionate woman, and she passionately tells him he forgot salt on his potatoes during the explanation of why they cannot marry because of the air. When she continues to refuse him, Fownes brings up the idea of leaving the dome city for freedom. She tells him that if they can leave, then she will let him call her by her first name. After the date, he goes to the library, where the old librarian tries to test him with old library cards. The story then cuts to a movement meeting, where the members discuss how the old society failed and the lack of a sound foreign policy. Fownes impatiently explains that he and his future wife must leave now, to which the leader explains that it is impossible because there is no sound foreign policy. When Fownes returns to the house, he finds MacBride in the doorway with dripping hair. MacBride yells that these are not optimum dome conditions, explaining that Lanfierre is in the upstairs bedroom. The entire dome air supply is going through his bedroom, and a strange black cloud appears. Fownes recognizes this as a Kansas twister and runs towards the next house for Mrs. Deshazaway. The dome glass has begun to fall, destroying the artificial sun and optimum temperature. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in a nameless domed city in the future: it has perfect temperature conditions, its citizens never leave the city's borders and must be conformists, i.e lack any signs of aberration. Mr. Humphrey Fownes is a rather eccentric citizen that caught the attention of the police lieutenants whose job is to maintain normality within the dome\u2019s society. Lanfierre, Dome\u2019s police lieutenant, has been following Fownes for months and is truly impressed by his queerness and eccentricity. \nAt the beginning, together with lieutenant MacBride he collects personal information about Fownes, his parameters, the content of his pockets, etc. While sitting in a car parked near Fownes\u2019 house, Lanfierre tells MacBride about the other strange things that he has witnessed while studying Fownes\u2019 life, for example, that his house is shaking occasionally or that his windows always close at the same moment. MacBride is skeptical but unexpectedly all the windows actually slam shut in one second and the walls start wobbling. At the same time, Fownes is inside the house: after closing the windows he goes down to his closet mechanism that creates an illusion of a sunset with flowers, then adding the rain and wind - the things he believed ancients had. Using that mechanism, he wants to seduce Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow whose four ex-husbands died. During their supper, she states that she won\u2019t marry Mr.Fownes but hints at changing her mind if he gets them both outside the dome. Later, he goes to a library meeting of people that criticize the existence of the dome but they cannot provide Fownes with any useful information regarding leaving the city and going outside. \n\nWhile Fownes is away, the police lieutenants decide to enter his house, and  Lanfierre out of curiosity turns the wheel that switches the closet mechanism and opens the valve of the bootleg pipe connected to the dome air system. Walking back, Fownes sees his house shaking. Desperate, MacBride and Lanfierre ask him if they can stop the wind but Humphrey realizes that there is nothing they can do to stop the entire dome air supply from coming through his room. The wind blows off the roof and creates a twister. MacBride orders Humphrey to stop everything immediately, but Fownes leaves the shocked police and runs happily to Mrs. Deshazaway, screaming and asking for her hand, hoping the twister will get them to the outside world, just like it did in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story follows an eccentric man named Humphrey Fownes that lives inside of a domed city. As Fownes is walking around the neighborhood, it is revealed that he is being tracked by the police for his eccentric nature. The police sent undercover people to pickpocket him and steal anything they could find in his pockets. After this walk and while the police wait outside his car, it is revealed that Fownes built a machine that creates different environments inside his house. Fownes then meets with his neighbor and it is said that he is in love with her, and the environments created in his house are meant to replicate romantic scenarios and get her to marry him. After she says that she will only marry Fownes if they leave the dome together, he goes to the library to find ways to escape the dome. There, he meets with members of the Movement, a group of people that got together in order to protest the reality in which they lived. Here he finds an old book jacket of The Wizard of Oz, which had a twister on the front. After going home, he finds that his house is shaking and his machine is creating a storm of water and wind. He realizes that in his absence the police had entered and broken his machines. After rescuing the two policemen, the storm gets worse and worse and eventually turns into a twister. Fownes realizes that the twister is destroying the dome and eagerly calls to his neighbor to join him in following the twister outside the dome. ",
        "Summary_4": "Humphrey Fownes has been pick-pocketed by the police disguised as the ordinary. He does not notice all the intended bumping because he is weirdly preoccupied with the question of the always optimum weather in the dome. The police target him because his house often shakes heavily, and he is considered a weird person. \n\nHis house shakes because he connects pipes between the dome blower system and his cellar, letting the winds build up in his house, which causes the dancing of the house. He never notices the phenomenon of his home because it always happens when he is in the place and preoccupied with his plan of getting Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow, to marry him. He builds all this mechanism to create an illusion of imaginary ancient romance, hoping to get a slight chance to let Mrs. Deshazaway nod her head. But he constantly fails because she is so scared that the fifth man will die in the marriage with her. Nonetheless, when Humphrey tells her his plan of leaving the dome, she promises him that she will marry him if they can go and live somewhere else with fresher air.\n\nHumphrey goes to the Movement, an organization that wants to protest the lack of a sound foreign policy in the dome. This organization informs members of the goodness of living in the Open Country. Humphrey tries to know how to leave the dome through the Movement, but the leader disappoints him. When he returns home, he sees his house shaking. The two officials are in his place, and one of them turns on the wheel in the bedroom, which leads to the constant winds blowing from the blower system. The winds build up to a certain point that it becomes a twister, which eventually breaks the dome apart. Humphrey\u2019s dream has come true. He runs away to find Mrs. Deshazaway because he can finally marry her.\n"

Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has\nno control whatever? Where the\n   \n   wind\n   \n  blows across\n   \n   prairies\n   \n  ; or is\nit the other way around? No matter. How would you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  , Mrs.\nDeshazaway?\"\n  \n \n  Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her\ntwo hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway.\nAnd June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is\nsupposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond\nthe dome.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   And\n   \n  ,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say\nthat somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight,\nthe sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it's\n   \n   vernal\n   \n  and that's when it roams the Open Country where geigers no\nlonger scintillate.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   My.\n   \n  \" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came\nback to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us\noutside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays\n   \n   warm\n   \n  long enough\nfor his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ...\nyou may call me Agnes.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Men are too perishable,\" Mrs. Deshazaway said over dinner. \"For all\npractical purposes I'm never going to marry again. All my husbands die.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would you pass the beets, please?\" Humphrey Fownes said.\n  \n \n  She handed him a platter of steaming red beets. \"And don't look at me\nthat way,\" she said. \"I'm\n   \n   not\n   \n  going to marry you and if you want\nreasons I'll give you four of them. Andrew. Curt. Norman. And Alphonse.\"\n  \n \n  The widow was a passionate woman. She did everything\npassionately\u2014talking, cooking, dressing. Her beets were passionately\nred. Her clothes rustled and her high heels clicked and her jewelry\ntinkled. She was possessed by an uncontrollable dynamism. Fownes had\nnever known anyone like her. \"You forgot to put salt on the potatoes,\"\nshe said passionately, then went on as calmly as it was possible for\nher to be, to explain why she couldn't marry him. \"Do you have any\nidea what people are saying? They're all saying I'm a cannibal! I rob\nmy husbands of their life force and when they're empty I carry their\nbodies outside on my way to the justice of the peace.\"\n  \n \n  \"As long as there are people,\" he said philosophically, \"there'll be\ntalk.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it's the air! Why don't they talk about that? The air is stale,\nI'm positive. It's not nourishing. The air is stale and Andrew, Curt,\nNorman and Alphonse couldn't stand it. Poor Alphonse. He was never so\nhealthy as on the day he was born. From then on things got steadily\nworse for him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't seem to mind the air.\"\n  \n \n  She threw up her hands. \"You'd be the worst of the lot!\" She left the\ntable, rustling and tinkling about the room. \"I can just hear them. Try\nsome of the asparagus.\n   \n   Five.\n   \n  That's what they'd say. That woman did\nit again. And the plain fact is I don't want you on my record.\"\n  \n \n  \"Really,\" Fownes protested. \"I feel splendid. Never better.\"\n  \n \n  He could hear her moving about and then felt her hands on his\nshoulders. \"And what about those\n   \n   very\n   \n  elaborate plans you've been\nmaking to seduce me?\"\n  \n \n  Fownes froze with three asparagus hanging from his fork.\n  \n \n  \"Don't you think\n   \n   they'll\n   \n  find out?\n   \n   I\n   \n  found out and you can bet\n   \n   they\n   \n  will. It's my fault, I guess. I talk too much. And I don't\nalways tell the truth. To be completely honest with you, Mr. Fownes, it\nwasn't the old customs at all standing between us, it was air. I can't\nhave another man die on me, it's bad for my self-esteem. And now you've\ngone and done something good and criminal, something peculiar.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Mrs. Agnes Deshazaway is a widow who had previously married four men. All of her four husbands died; she claims that she will never marry again. However, she is also considered to be a passionate woman who does everything passionately. Whether it be talking, cooking, dressing, everything about her is passionate. She also has uncontrollable dynamism, and Fownes remarks that he has never known anyone like her. Despite her passion, she is also self-conscious of what other people think of her, telling Fownes that there is a rumor that she is a cannibal. She blames her husbands\u2019 deaths on the air and gets angry when Fownes says that he does not mind. Despite how reluctant she is to marry Fownes, Mrs. Deshazaway also has a hopeful side to her. She is quite attentive when Fownes tells her the possibility of leaving the dome, telling him that she will allow him to marry her if the both of them can leave. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mrs. Deshazaway is a citizen of the domed city and a widow whose four ex-husbands died while being married to her. She\u2019s the love interest of Mr. Humphrey Fownes - he tries to seduce her by making a mechanism that recreates the outside world and later by promising her to get them both outside the dome. She\u2019s a passionate woman who doesn\u2019t like when people gossip about her, fearing that if Humphrey marries her and dies the neighbors will resent her even more. She\u2019s dreaming of going to the open world and breathing fresh air that will allow her new husband to live long",
        "Summary_3": "Mrs. Deshazaway is Fownes' neighbor and love interest. They have supper every night together at her house. She is a widow of 4 husbands, who she believes all died due to the bad quality of air inside the dome. Because of this, she rejects Fownes\u2019 various proposals, and ultimately says that they will only get married if Fownes finds a way to get them out of the dome. She is described as a very passionate and practical woman. She is a very smart woman and she knows of the love that Fownes has for her. ",
        "Summary_4": "Mrs. Deshazaway is a widow who lost her four husbands: Andrew, Curt, Norman, and Alphonse. She is a passionate woman who talks, cooks, and does everything passionately. She is always energetic. She keeps refusing Humphrey Fownes's proposal, a man who falls in love with her ardently. All of her husbands died, and their deaths are blamed on her by the rumors. She believes the cause of their deaths is the bad air in the dome. But she told Humphrey that she refused him because of the ancient custom, which is a lie. The reason is the rumor, not the ancient traditions. She finds out about Humphrey's secret closet of the Master Mechanism, and she is afraid that the official will come to inspect her because of it. When Humphrey told her his plan of leaving the dome with her, she promised him that if he could make it comes true, she would marry him and let him call her \"Agnes.\""

        "Summary_1": "The story is set inside a dome city with an artificial sun and optimal weather conditions. Fownes first strolls down a quiet residential avenue lined with private houses. Although the weather is generally cloudless, there are light showers that make small geysers of shiny mist. His house is also noted to be located right next to Mrs. Deshazaway\u2019s house. Inside of an orange car, Lanfierre and MacBride watch him. Fownes\u2019 house has a porch and a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system. His downstairs closet contains the Master Mechanism. The illusion he sees is of a red sun setting brightly, marred by an occasional arcover that leaves the scent of ozone. There is a garden outside as well, and a gigantic moon hidden in a large area of the sky. Neon large roses are found in the garden, and their colors change from red to violet. Inside of his bedroom closet upstairs, there is a rainmaker. The outside world that Fownes describes to Mrs. Deshazaway, outside of the dome, is one with miles and miles of space. The real-estate monopoly has no control, and the windows blow across prairies. When Fownes goes to the library, the place is described as a shattered and depressing place. It is used very infrequently, filled with given over government publications and censored old books with holes in them. The librarian's desk has ancient library cards that are almost impossible to read. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place in the future where people live in a domed city. It has perfect climate conditions and its citizens are required to have regulated, non-aberrative lives - this order is maintained by the police. The story starts from a short walk that Mr. Humphrey, an eccentric citizen, takes while coming back to his house. There he again looks at his mechanism, parts of which are connected to the water and air systems of the dome, that creates an illusion of a sunset, strong wind, or rain. He leaves for dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow with a bad reputation - Humphrey created the mechanism to seduce and marry her. Later, he goes to a meeting of some nonconformists in a library where they talk about the prehistory of the domed society. Walking back, he notices that his building is shaking and soon learns that while he was away the police decided to search his house and one of them switched on the mechanism letting all the dome air supply go through his bedroom. Realizing that nothing can be done and seeing his roof fly off, Humphrey runs to Mrs. Deshazaway, hoping that the appearing twister will take them outside the dome, to some unique new world, like it did in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set in a dystopian city, where everything seems to be controlled perfectly, including the weather. The city is also inside of a large, glass dome that has robots that constantly fix it as pieces of class constantly fall onto the city below. Fownes\u2019 home is located on a very quiet and residential street, but his house was everything but that. His home is described as an old and large house, with a machine that can change the environment of the house and constantly makes it shake. Part of the story also takes place in a library, which is old and unkempt. ",
        "Summary_4": "People live in the dome where the weather is always optimum, with 59 degrees and 47% humidity. Everyone who lives in the dome must be normal and not act weird. Otherwise, the officials will inspect the queerness and conduct some necessary actions to protect the normality in the dome. A sound foreign policy cannot be formed before, resulting in a confined dome society with no foreign policy.

        "Summary_1": "The Master Mechanism in the downstairs closet is similar to a watch being inside of a great watch case. There is a profusion of wheels surrounding it, and the Mechanism itself is a miniature see-saw that goes back and forth 365-1/4 times an hour. The wheels are salvaged from grandfather\u2019s clocks and music boxes, going around in graceful circles at a rate of 30 to 31 times an hour. However, there is one eccentric cam that goes between 28 and 29. Fownes also sets the time to seven o\u2019clock on April 7th of any year. This Master Mechanism is significant because it is capable of showing the ideal illusion to Fownes. He uses this Mechanism to envision his ideal life outside of the dome, and it gives him the home that he hopes to see instead of the one that he is currently living inside of the dome. These illusions also motivate him to try and find a way to leave the dome with the widow. The Master Mechanism serves as a motivator for Fownes, and it allows him to envision his dreams into a form of reality. ",
        "Summary_2": "Humphrey Fownes has a complex Master Mechanism in his downstairs closet. It consists of various wheels surrounding a miniature see-saw and allows him to choose a date and a time of the day and experience the weather conditions at this very moment. Together with the bedroom wheels, he can create an illusion of a rainy, windy April evening, he can smell roses and listen to a romantic song about love. He wants to use this mechanism to make Mrs. Deshazaway, a passionate widow living next door, fall in love with him and get married. At the end of the story, when the police officer unknowingly switches the mechanism, making the wind and water work in the full-power mode, which soon makes the wind currents uncontrollable, this mechanism destroys Fownes\u2019 roof and creates a twister that jeopardizes the infrastructure of the entire city and the dome\u2019s integrity. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Master Mechanism is a machine inside of Fownes\u2019 house. The machine was made by Fownes himself, and is made from wheels, gears and tubes. The machines allow Fownes to harness the water and wind from the city and create different environments inside of the house. Fownes made this machine in order to create romantic scenarios and get Mrs. Deshazaway to marry him. At the end, the two policemen destroy the machine and it ends up destroying Fownes\u2019 home by creating a twister. This twister also ends up destroying the dome and allows Fownes and Mrs. Deshazaway a way out. ",
        "Summary_4": "The closet is like a big watch case. Many wheels inside surround a miniature see-saw that goes back and forth 365-4/1 times an hour, the Master Mechanism. The wheels are old, coming from old grandfather\u2019s clocks or music boxes and moving gracefully at the same speed, except for one that moves eccentrically slower than the others. This machine enables Fownes to create an illusion that depicts his imaginary ancient nature. In addition, this closet connects to a pipe in the bedroom, equipped with a wheel that adjusts the flow of winds from the dome blower system. So whenever he turns on the wheel in the bedroom upstairs, the winds will blow through the pipes towards the downstairs closet, building up the air pressure in the room. This connection between the wheel mechanism and the dome blower system is the cause of the house shaking, which eventually creates an artificial twister that breaks the dome, enabling Fownes to go outside of the dome, which has been his wish from the beginning of the story."

He hurries to mark an X on a tree for his position and heads back to the clearing of the temporary camp site. This place is home to the only eleven humans, with Alan, on the planet of Waiamea. Once Alan returns to the site, he observes the killer robots and praises Pete for getting them to work. However, when the robots turn on him, he realizes that the robots must have been programmed to pick up human brain waves. He thinks back to Penny, a girl he married three weeks ago who will be arriving with the rest of the colonists tomorrow. This becomes his reason to live against the killer robots, and he observes the killer robots. He fires into the undergrowth and berates himself for not loading fresh cells in the morning as the robot gets louder. He is injured by one and cries out as he feels himself dying. As the robot comes towards him again, he understands what it means to live and forces himself to keep walking. Alan then hugs the bank as pure electricity arches over him, sliding slowly and away from the machine above. The robot trembles and suddenly falls; this gives Alan an opportunity to tackle it. The two struggle, but Alan takes a hunting knife out and jams it into the robot. He wonders how Pete managed to create these robots so perfectly. Suddenly, he hears an approaching robot and realizes that they communicate with each other even if one of them is jammed. Alan decides to run towards the camp because he realizes that\u2019s where the brain of the robots is located. Shortly after running, he finds himself lost because the camp has not appeared in sight yet. He tries to think back to where the camp could be and narrowly misses getting blasted by one of the killer robots. When he fires the pocket blaster, it cancels out the radio transmission from the computer to the robot; Alan sees this as an opportunity to go towards the headquarters building. His blaster suddenly quits, but he manages to hurl a pile of dirt and insects at the robots. He goes into the room quickly as the robot continues to blast. The robot aims point blank at him as he hurls himself towards the red-clad safety switch. Everything then fades to black.

After walking back, he realizes that the killer robots, that his friend was building and whose main goal was to pick up animals\u2019 and dangerous predators\u2019 brain activity and kill them, have been programmed in a wrong way, and now they are aiming at every living creature, including humans. He sees that the other colonists in the camp were already killed, and Alan himself is accidentally saved by a predator who attacks the robot aiming at him. The metal killers are now moving around the territory, guarding it, and trying to pick up somebody\u2019s brain waves. Remembering his wife Peggy and everyone else who was going to land on the next day, Alan decides to at least try to fight the robots and prevent them from killing everybody on this approaching ship. He runs through the jungle, bruising his arms and legs, getting bitten by insects, and manages to temporarily disable the robot by half-drowning him in the river and stabbing his metal corpus with a knife. When he hears the other robots approaching the river he realizes that they must be connected by radio and, thus, are controlled by the main computer in the camp\u2019s headquarters. He runs back to the camp, firing with his blaster which slows down the robots a little bit. Thinking about the importance of the human species and overcoming excruciating throbbing pain in his limbs, Alan gets to the camp. He runs out of blaster cells but makes his way to the computer room. With a robot aiming right at him Alan jumps towards the safety switch and instantly loses consciousness. Three days later Alan finally wakes up with agonizing pain.

Alan stopped,\npuzzled. Two more blasts, quickly\ntogether, and the sound of a\nscream faintly.\n  \n \n  Frowning, worrying about the\nsounds, Alan momentarily forgot\nto watch his step until his foot\nsuddenly plunged into an ant\nhill, throwing him to the jungle\nfloor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again,\nfor the tenth time, and stood\nuncertainly in the dimness.\nFrom tall, moss-shrouded trees,\nwrist-thick vines hung quietly,\nscraping the spongy ground like\nthe tentacles of some monstrous\ntree-bound octopus. Fitful little\nplants grew straggly in the\nshadows of the mossy trunks,\nforming a dense underbrush that\nmade walking difficult. At midday\nsome few of the blue sun's\nrays filtered through to the\njungle floor, but now, late afternoon\non the planet, the shadows\nwere long and gloomy.\n  \n \n  Alan peered around him at the\nvine-draped shadows, listening\nto the soft rustlings and faint\ntwig-snappings of life in the\njungle. Two short, popping\nsounds echoed across the stillness,\ndrowned out almost immediately\nand silenced by an\nexplosive crash. Alan started,\n\"Blaster fighting! But it can't\nbe!\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly anxious, he slashed\na hurried X in one of the trees\nto mark his position then turned\nto follow a line of similar marks\nback through the jungle. He\ntried to run, but vines blocked\nhis way and woody shrubs\ncaught at his legs, tripping him\nand holding him back. Then,\nthrough the trees he saw the\nclearing of the camp site, the\ntemporary home for the scout\nship and the eleven men who,\nwith Alan, were the only humans\non the jungle planet, Waiamea.\n  \n \n \n  Stepping through the low\nshrubbery at the edge of the\nsite, he looked across the open\narea to the two temporary structures,\nthe camp headquarters\nwhere the power supplies and\nthe computer were; and the\nsleeping quarters. Beyond, nose\nhigh, stood the silver scout ship\nthat had brought the advance\nexploratory party of scientists\nand technicians to Waiamea\nthree days before. Except for a\nfew of the killer robots rolling\nslowly around the camp site on\ntheir quiet treads, there was no\none about.\n  \n \n  \"So, they've finally got those\nthings working.\" Alan smiled\nslightly. \"Guess that means I\nowe Pete a bourbon-and-soda\nfor sure. Anybody who can\nbuild a robot that hunts by homing\nin on animals' mind impulses ...\"\nHe stepped forward\njust as a roar of blue flame dissolved\nthe branches of a tree,\nbarely above his head.\n  \n \n  Without pausing to think,\nAlan leaped back, and fell\nsprawling over a bush just as\none of the robots rolled silently\nup from the right, lowering its\nblaster barrel to aim directly at\nhis head. Alan froze. \"My God,\nPete built those things wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly a screeching whirlwind\nof claws and teeth hurled\nitself from the smoldering\nbranches and crashed against the\nrobot, clawing insanely at the\nantenna and blaster barrel.\nWith an awkward jerk the robot\nswung around and fired its blaster,\ncompletely dissolving the\nlower half of the cat creature\nwhich had clung across the barrel.\nBut the back pressure of the\ncat's body overloaded the discharge\ncircuits. The robot started\nto shake, then clicked sharply\nas an overload relay snapped\nand shorted the blaster cells.\nThe killer turned and rolled back\ntowards the camp, leaving Alan\nalone.\n  \n \n  Shakily, Alan crawled a few\nfeet back into the undergrowth\nwhere he could lie and watch the\ncamp, but not himself be seen.\nThough visibility didn't make\nany difference to the robots, he\nfelt safer, somehow, hidden. He\nknew now what the shooting\nsounds had been and why there\nhadn't been anyone around the\ncamp site. A charred blob lying\nin the grass of the clearing confirmed\nhis hypothesis. His stomach\nfelt sick.\n  \n \n  \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"that Pete assembled\nthese robots in a batch and then\nactivated them all at once, probably\nnever living to realize that\nthey're tuned to pick up human\nbrain waves, too. Damn!\nDamn!\" His eyes blurred and\nhe slammed his fist into the soft\nearth.\n  \n \n  When he raised his eyes again\nthe jungle was perceptibly darker.\nStealthy rustlings in the\nshadows grew louder with the\nsetting sun. Branches snapped\nunaccountably in the trees overhead\nand every now and then\nleaves or a twig fell softly to the\nground, close to where he lay.\nReaching into his jacket, Alan\nfingered his pocket blaster. He\npulled it out and held it in his\nright hand. \"This pop gun\nwouldn't even singe a robot, but\nit just might stop one of those\npumas.\"\n  \n \n  They said the blast with your name on it would find\nyou anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.\n  \n \n  Slowly Alan looked around,\nsizing up his situation. Behind\nhim the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\nHe shuddered. \"Not a\nvery healthy spot to spend the\nnight. On the other hand, I certainly\ncan't get to the camp with\na pack of mind-activated mechanical\nkillers running around.\nIf I can just hold out until morning,\nwhen the big ship arrives ...\nThe big ship! Good\nLord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\noily sweat punctuated his forehead.\nPeggy, arriving tomorrow\nwith the other colonists, the\nwives and kids! The metal killers,\ntuned to blast any living\nflesh, would murder them the\ninstant they stepped from the\nship!\n  \n \n \n  A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\nhe'd married just three weeks\nago. He still couldn't believe it.\nIt was crazy, he supposed, to\nmarry a girl and then take off\nfor an unknown planet, with her\nto follow, to try to create a home\nin a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\nbut Peggy and her green eyes\nthat changed color with the\nlight, with her soft brown hair,\nand her happy smile, had ended\nthirty years of loneliness and\nhad, at last, given him a reason\nfor living. \"Not to be killed!\"\nAlan unclenched his fists and\nwiped his palms, bloody where\nhis fingernails had dug into the\nflesh.\n  \n \n  There was a slight creak above\nhim like the protesting of a\nbranch too heavily laden. Blaster\nready, Alan rolled over onto his\nback. In the movement, his elbow\nstruck the top of a small\nearthy mound and he was instantly\nengulfed in a swarm of\nlocust-like insects that beat disgustingly\nagainst his eyes and\nmouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\narms before his face he jumped\nup and backwards, away from\nthe bugs. As he did so, a dark\nshapeless thing plopped from\nthe trees onto the spot where he\nhad been lying stretched out.\nThen, like an ambient fungus,\nit slithered off into the jungle\nundergrowth.\n  \n \n  For a split second the jungle\nstood frozen in a brilliant blue\nflash, followed by the sharp report\nof a blaster. Then another.\nAlan whirled, startled. The\nplanet's double moon had risen\nand he could see a robot rolling\nslowly across the clearing in his\ngeneral direction, blasting indiscriminately\nat whatever mind\nimpulses came within its pickup\nrange, birds, insects, anything.\nSix or seven others also left the\ncamp headquarters area and\nheaded for the jungle, each to a\nslightly different spot.\n  \n \n  Apparently the robot hadn't\nsensed him yet, but Alan didn't\nknow what the effective range\nof its pickup devices was. He\nbegan to slide back into the\njungle. Minutes later, looking\nback he saw that the machine,\nthough several hundred yards\naway, had altered its course and\nwas now headed directly for\nhim.\n  \n \n  His stomach tightened. Panic.\nThe dank, musty smell of the\njungle seemed for an instant to\nthicken and choke in his throat.\nThen he thought of the big ship\nlanding in the morning, settling\ndown slowly after a lonely two-week\nvoyage. He thought of a\nbrown-haired girl crowding with\nthe others to the gangway, eager\nto embrace the new planet, and\nthe next instant a charred nothing,\nunrecognizable, the victim\nof a design error or a misplaced\nwire in a machine. \"I have to\ntry,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\ntry.\" He moved into the blackness.\n  \n \n  Powerful as a small tank, the\nkiller robot was equipped to\ncrush, slash, and burn its way\nthrough undergrowth. Nevertheless,\nit was slowed by the\nlarger trees and the thick, clinging\nvines, and Alan found that\nhe could manage to keep ahead\nof it, barely out of blaster range.\nOnly, the robot didn't get tired.\nAlan did.\n  \n \n  The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\nshadows that wavered\nand danced across the jungle\nfloor, hiding debris that tripped\nhim and often sent him sprawling\ninto the dark. Sharp-edged\ngrowths tore at his face and\nclothes, and insects attracted by\nthe blood matted against his\npants and shirt. Behind, the robot\ncrashed imperturbably after\nhim, lighting the night with fitful\nblaster flashes as some\nwinged or legged life came within\nits range.\n  \n \n  There was movement also, in\nthe darkness beside him, scrapings\nand rustlings and an occasional\nlow, throaty sound like an\nangry cat. Alan's fingers tensed\non his pocket blaster. Swift\nshadowy forms moved quickly in\nthe shrubs and the growling became\nsuddenly louder. He fired\ntwice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\nSharp screams punctuated\nthe electric blue discharge as\na pack of small feline creatures\nleaped snarling and clawing\nback into the night.\n  \n \n \n  Mentally, Alan tried to figure\nthe charge remaining in his blaster.\nThere wouldn't be much.\n\"Enough for a few more shots,\nmaybe. Why the devil didn't I\nload in fresh cells this morning!\"\n  \n \n  The robot crashed on, louder\nnow, gaining on the tired human.\nLegs aching and bruised,\nstinging from insect bites, Alan\ntried to force himself to run\nholding his hands in front of\nhim like a child in the dark. His\nfoot tripped on a barely visible\ninsect hill and a winged swarm\nexploded around him. Startled,\nAlan jerked sideways, crashing\nhis head against a tree. He\nclutched at the bark for a second,\ndazed, then his knees\nbuckled. His blaster fell into the\nshadows.\n  \n \n  The robot crashed loudly behind\nhim now. Without stopping\nto think, Alan fumbled along the\nground after his gun, straining\nhis eyes in the darkness. He\nfound it just a couple of feet to\none side, against the base of a\nsmall bush. Just as his fingers\nclosed upon the barrel his other\nhand slipped into something\nsticky that splashed over his\nforearm. He screamed in pain\nand leaped back, trying frantically\nto wipe the clinging,\nburning blackness off his arm.\nPatches of black scraped off onto\nbranches and vines, but the rest\nspread slowly over his arm as\nagonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\nbeing ripped away layer by\nlayer.\n  \n \n  Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\nAlan stumbled forward.\nSharp muscle spasms shot from\nhis shoulder across his back and\nchest. Tears streamed across his\ncheeks.\n  \n \n  A blue arc slashed at the trees\na mere hundred yards behind.\nHe screamed at the blast. \"Damn\nyou, Pete! Damn your robots!\nDamn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\nHe stepped into emptiness.\n  \n \n  Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\nby the water, the pain began to\nfall away. He wanted to lie there\nforever in the dark, cool, wetness.\nFor ever, and ever, and ...\nThe air thundered.\n  \n \n  In the dim light he could see\nthe banks of the stream, higher\nthan a man, muddy and loose.\nGrowing right to the edge of the\nbanks, the jungle reached out\nwith hairy, disjointed arms as\nif to snag even the dirty little\nstream that passed so timidly\nthrough its domain.\n  \n \n  Alan, lying in the mud of the\nstream bed, felt the earth shake\nas the heavy little robot rolled\nslowly and inexorably towards\nhim. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\nhe thought, \"in battle\ndress.\" He tried to stand but his\nlegs were almost too weak and\nhis arm felt numb. \"I'll drown\nhim,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown\nthe Lord High Executioner.\" He\nlaughed. Then his mind cleared.\nHe remembered where he was.\n  \n \n \n  Alan trembled. For the first\ntime in his life he understood\nwhat it was to live, because for\nthe first time he realized that he\nwould sometime die. In other\ntimes and circumstances he\nmight put it off for a while, for\nmonths or years, but eventually,\nas now, he would have to watch,\nstill and helpless, while death\ncame creeping. Then, at thirty,\nAlan became a man.\n  \n \n  \"Dammit, no law says I have\nto flame-out\n   \n   now\n   \n  !\" He forced\nhimself to rise, forced his legs\nto stand, struggling painfully in\nthe shin-deep ooze. He worked\nhis way to the bank and began to\ndig frenziedly, chest high, about\ntwo feet below the edge.\n  \n \n  His arm where the black thing\nhad been was swollen and tender,\nbut he forced his hands to dig,\ndig, dig, cursing and crying to\nhide the pain, and biting his\nlips, ignoring the salty taste of\nblood. The soft earth crumbled\nunder his hands until he had a\nsmall cave about three feet deep\nin the bank. Beyond that the\nsoil was held too tightly by the\nroots from above and he had to\nstop.\n  \n \n \n  The air crackled blue and a\ntree crashed heavily past Alan\ninto the stream. Above him on\nthe bank, silhouetting against\nthe moons, the killer robot stopped\nand its blaster swivelled\nslowly down. Frantically, Alan\nhugged the bank as a shaft of\npure electricity arced over him,\nsliced into the water, and exploded\nin a cloud of steam. The\nrobot shook for a second, its\nblaster muzzle lifted erratically\nand for an instant it seemed almost\nout of control, then it\nquieted and the muzzle again\npointed down.\n  \n \n  Pressing with all his might,\nAlan slid slowly along the bank\ninches at a time, away from the\nmachine above. Its muzzle turned\nto follow him but the edge of\nthe bank blocked its aim. Grinding\nforward a couple of feet,\nslightly overhanging the bank,\nthe robot fired again. For a split\nsecond Alan seemed engulfed in\nflame; the heat of hell singed his\nhead and back, and mud boiled\nin the bank by his arm.\n  \n \n  Again the robot trembled. It\njerked forward a foot and its\nblaster swung slightly away. But\nonly for a moment. Then the gun\nswung back again.\n  \n \n  Suddenly, as if sensing something\nwrong, its tracks slammed\ninto reverse. It stood poised for\na second, its treads spinning\ncrazily as the earth collapsed underneath\nit, where Alan had\ndug, then it fell with a heavy\nsplash into the mud, ten feet\nfrom where Alan stood.\n  \n \n  Without hesitation Alan\nthrew himself across the blaster\nhousing, frantically locking his\narms around the barrel as the\nrobot's treads churned furiously\nin the sticky mud, causing it to\nbuck and plunge like a Brahma\nbull. The treads stopped and the\nblaster jerked upwards wrenching\nAlan's arms, then slammed\ndown. Then the whole housing\nwhirled around and around, tilting\nalternately up and down like\na steel-skinned water monster\ntrying to dislodge a tenacious\ncrab, while Alan, arms and legs\nwrapped tightly around the blaster\nbarrel and housing, pressed\nfiercely against the robot's metal\nskin.\n  \n \n  Slowly, trying to anticipate\nand shift his weight with the\nspinning plunges, Alan worked\nhis hand down to his right hip.\nHe fumbled for the sheath clipped\nto his belt, found it, and extracted\na stubby hunting knife.\nSweat and blood in his eyes,\nhardly able to move on the wildly\nswinging turret, he felt down\nthe sides to the thin crack between\nthe revolving housing and\nthe stationary portion of the robot.\nWith a quick prayer he\njammed in the knife blade\u2014and\nwas whipped headlong into the\nmud as the turret literally snapped\nto a stop.\n  \n \n  The earth, jungle and moons\nspun in a pinwheeled blur,\nslowed, and settled to their proper\nplaces. Standing in the sticky,\nsweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\nthe robot apprehensively. Half\nburied in mud, it stood quiet in\nthe shadowy light except for an\noccasional, almost spasmodic\njerk of its blaster barrel. For\nthe first time that night Alan\nallowed himself a slight smile.\n\"A blade in the old gear box,\neh? How does that feel, boy?\"\n  \n \n  He turned. \"Well, I'd better\nget out of here before the knife\nslips or the monster cooks up\nsome more tricks with whatever\nit's got for a brain.\" Digging\nlittle footholds in the soft bank,\nhe climbed up and stood once\nagain in the rustling jungle\ndarkness.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\nPete could cram enough brain\ninto one of those things to make\nit hunt and track so perfectly.\"\nHe tried to visualize the computing\ncircuits needed for the\noperation of its tracking mechanism\nalone. \"There just isn't\nroom for the electronics. You'd\nneed a computer as big as the\none at camp headquarters.\"\n  \n \n \n  In the distance the sky blazed\nas a blaster roared in the jungle.\nThen Alan heard the approaching\nrobot, crunching and snapping\nits way through the undergrowth\nlike an onrushing forest\nfire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\nThey communicate with each\nother! The one I jammed must\nbe calling others to help.\"\n  \n \n  He began to move along the\nbank, away from the crashing\nsounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\neyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\nI'll bet anything they're\nautomatically controlled by the\ncamp computer. That's where\ntheir brain is!\" He paused.\n\"Then, if that were put out of\ncommission ...\" He jerked away\nfrom the bank and half ran, half\npulled himself through the undergrowth\ntowards the camp.\n  \n \n  Trees exploded to his left as\nanother robot fired in his direction,\ntoo far away to be effective\nbut churning towards him\nthrough the blackness.\n  \n \n  Alan changed direction slightly\nto follow a line between the\ntwo robots coming up from\neither side, behind him. His eyes\nwere well accustomed to the dark\nnow, and he managed to dodge\nmost of the shadowy vines and\nbranches before they could snag\nor trip him. Even so, he stumbled\nin the wiry underbrush and\nhis legs were a mass of stinging\nslashes from ankle to thigh.\n  \n \n  The crashing rumble of the\nkiller robots shook the night behind\nhim, nearer sometimes,\nthen falling slightly back, but\nfollowing constantly, more\nunshakable than bloodhounds\nbecause a man can sometimes cover\na scent, but no man can stop his\nthoughts. Intermittently, like\nphotographers' strobes, blue\nflashes would light the jungle\nabout him. Then, for seconds\nafterwards his eyes would see\ndancing streaks of yellow and\nsharp multi-colored pinwheels\nthat alternately shrunk and expanded\nas if in a surrealist's\nnightmare. Alan would have to\npause and squeeze his eyelids\ntight shut before he could see\nagain, and the robots would\nmove a little closer.\n  \n \n  To his right the trees silhouetted\nbriefly against brilliance as\na third robot slowly moved up\nin the distance. Without thinking,\nAlan turned slightly to the\nleft, then froze in momentary\npanic. \"I should be at the camp\nnow. Damn, what direction am\nI going?\" He tried to think\nback, to visualize the twists and\nturns he'd taken in the jungle.\n\"All I need is to get lost.\"\n  \n \n  He pictured the camp computer\nwith no one to stop it, automatically\nsending its robots in\nwider and wider forays, slowly\nwiping every trace of life from\nthe planet. Technologically advanced\nmachines doing the job\nfor which they were built, completely,\nthoroughly, without feeling,\nand without human masters\nto separate sense from futility.\nFinally parts would wear out,\ncircuits would short, and one by\none the killers would crunch to\na halt. A few birds would still\nfly then, but a unique animal\nlife, rare in the universe, would\nexist no more. And the bones of\nchildren, eager girls, and their\nmen would also lie, beside a\nrusty hulk, beneath the alien\nsun.\n  \n \n  \"Peggy!\"\n  \n \n  As if in answer, a tree beside\nhim breathed fire, then exploded.\nIn the brief flash of the\nblaster shot, Alan saw the steel\nglint of a robot only a hundred\nyards away, much nearer than\nhe had thought. \"Thank heaven\nfor trees!\" He stepped back, felt\nhis foot catch in something,\nclutched futilely at some leaves\nand fell heavily.\n  \n \n  Pain danced up his leg as he\ngrabbed his ankle. Quickly he\nfelt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\nthe rotten luck, anyway!\" He\nblinked the pain tears from his\neyes and looked up\u2014into a robot's\nblaster, jutting out of the\nfoliage, thirty yards away.\n  \n \n \n  Instinctively, in one motion\nAlan grabbed his pocket blaster\nand fired. To his amazement the\nrobot jerked back, its gun wobbled\nand started to tilt away.\nThen, getting itself under control,\nit swung back again to face\nAlan. He fired again, and again\nthe robot reacted. It seemed familiar\nsomehow. Then he remembered\nthe robot on the river\nbank, jiggling and swaying for\nseconds after each shot. \"Of\ncourse!\" He cursed himself for\nmissing the obvious. \"The blaster\nstatic blanks out radio\ntransmission from the computer\nfor a few seconds. They even do\nit to themselves!\"\n  \n \n  Firing intermittently, he\npulled himself upright and hobbled\nahead through the bush.\nThe robot shook spasmodically\nwith each shot, its gun tilted upward\nat an awkward angle.\n  \n \n  Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\nstars, real stars brilliant in the\nnight sky, and half dragging his\nswelling leg he stumbled out of\nthe jungle into the camp clearing.\nAhead, across fifty yards of\ngrass stood the headquarters\nbuilding, housing the robot-controlling\ncomputer. Still firing at\nshort intervals he started across\nthe clearing, gritting his teeth\nat every step.\n  \n \n  Straining every muscle in\nspite of the agonizing pain, Alan\nforced himself to a limping run\nacross the uneven ground, carefully\navoiding the insect hills\nthat jutted up through the grass.\nFrom the corner of his eye he\nsaw another of the robots standing\nshakily in the dark edge of\nthe jungle waiting, it seemed,\nfor his small blaster to run dry.\n  \n \n  \"Be damned! You can't win\nnow!\" Alan yelled between blaster\nshots, almost irrational from\nthe pain that ripped jaggedly\nthrough his leg. Then it happened.\nA few feet from the\nbuilding's door his blaster quit.\nA click. A faint hiss when he\nfrantically jerked the trigger\nagain and again, and the spent\ncells released themselves from\nthe device, falling in the grass\nat his feet. He dropped the useless\ngun.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" He threw himself on\nthe ground as a new robot suddenly\nappeared around the edge\nof the building a few feet away,\naimed, and fired. Air burned\nover Alan's back and ozone tingled\nin his nostrils.\n  \n \n  Blinding itself for a few seconds\nwith its own blaster static,\nthe robot paused momentarily,\njiggling in place. In this\ninstant, Alan jammed his hands\ninto an insect hill and hurled the\npile of dirt and insects directly\nat the robot's antenna. In a flash,\nhundreds of the winged things\nerupted angrily from the hole in\na swarming cloud, each part of\nwhich was a speck of life\ntransmitting mental energy to the\nrobot's pickup devices.\n  \n \n  Confused by the sudden dispersion\nof mind impulses, the\nrobot fired erratically as Alan\ncrouched and raced painfully for\nthe door. It fired again, closer,\nas he fumbled with the lock\nrelease. Jagged bits of plastic and\nstone ripped past him, torn loose\nby the blast.\n  \n \n  Frantically, Alan slammed\nopen the door as the robot, sensing\nhim strongly now, aimed\npoint blank. He saw nothing, his\nmind thought of nothing but the\nred-clad safety switch mounted\nbeside the computer. Time stopped.\nThere was nothing else in\nthe world. He half-jumped, half-fell\ntowards it, slowly, in tenths\nof seconds that seemed measured\nout in years.\n  \n \n  The universe went black.\n  \n \n  Later. Brilliance pressed upon\nhis eyes. Then pain returned, a\nmulti-hurting thing that crawled\nthrough his body and dragged\nragged tentacles across his\nbrain. He moaned.\n  \n \n  A voice spoke hollowly in the\ndistance. \"He's waking. Call his\nwife.\"\n  \n \n  Alan opened his eyes in a\nwhite room; a white light hung\nover his head. Beside him, looking\ndown with a rueful smile,\nstood a young man wearing\nspace medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\nhe acknowledged the question in\nAlan's eyes, \"you hit the switch.\nThat was three days ago. When\nyou're up again we'd all like to\nthank you.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\ngreen-eyed girl was pressed\ntightly against him. Neither of\nthem spoke. They couldn't.

        "Summary_1": "Alan is one of the men who have arrived on Waiamea. He ventures around the jungle planet but goes on the run after a programming error with Pete\u2019s robots. Alan is thirty years old, and he married a woman named Peggy three weeks earlier. Initially, he is very afraid of death and tries to protect himself from the robots. However, he does realize his love for Peggy and sees it as a motivation to continue living. He understands what it means to live for the first time in his life, and he becomes a lot more courageous. Instead of giving up, Alan chooses to find a way to defeat the robots. He also shows himself to be intelligent, figuring out that the robots are being controlled by radio transmissions via a computer in the headquarters building. Furthermore, he is capable of using his pocket blaster and knife to defeat one of the robots, even though it could instantly kill him with a single blast. Alan is very resilient as well; he is injured and continues to run around and fight against the robots. Even when the odds are against him, his desire to be with his wife gives him the strength to continue heading towards the headquarters building and flip off the switch. ",
        "Summary_2": "Alan is a thirty-year-old scientist and technician, who arrives on Waimea on a scout-ship with eleven colleagues. During his solo exploration, the reader learns about Alan's behavior, ingenuity, and will for survival. Although he faces numerous challenges, including attacks from carnivores, dangers of the jungle and its poisonous insects, as well as human-built robot exterminators, he perseveres. Alan's mission is to rid Waiamea of potential threats in the face of predators and other creatures to provide the planet with the safety of the life of the arriving colonizers. Throughout the story, the reader learns about the young and beautiful Peggy, Alan's wife, who should soon arrive on Waiamea. Alan, unconsciously in love with his wife, is motivated to stop the attack of robots at any cost, ensuring the safety of incoming people. His unwavering thirst for survival and endurance help the reader to recognize the weight of responsibility lying on Alan\u2019s shoulders and empathize with the main character throughout his tedious and dangerous journey.",
        "Summary_3": "Alan is the main character of the story, and is part of a scouting mission sent to a new planet to test if humans could live there. When the robots that were made to help them kill his crew, he has to find a way to shut them off while fighting them. Throughout the story Alan shows a lot of resilience and pain-tolerance. Even though he is very badly hurt by the robots, he continues fighting in order to save the incoming settlers and see his wife again. He is also very intelligent, using his knowledge to defeat a robot in a mud trap.",
        "Summary_4": "Alan is one of the first 11 colonists that came to the jungle planet Waiamea to explore it and get prepared for the arrival of all the other people. When the killer robots murder his colleagues and become a real danger to every human who is going to step out in the jungle on the next day, he has to think and act quickly. Being fairly intelligent, Alan realizes all the risks, understands the basic working mechanisms of the robots, and even manages to destroy one of them by ensnaring the robot in a trap on a bank and disabling him with a knife. He also understands that the only solution to the problem is switching off the main camp computer that controls all the robots. He is very devoted, brave, and rational, too. Both his love for his wife and realization of his responsibility for the future of humanity push him forward and enable him to overcome pain and save everyone from being killed by robots. "

        "Summary_1": "The killer robots work by homing in on the mind of animals\u2019 impulses. However, due to mass production, robots are also capable of picking up human brain waves. The robots are also capable of firing beams from its blaster, as one had dissolved a cat creature\u2019s entire lower half when it clung onto the robot. The blaster aim is almost always perfect unless the robot\u2019s radio wave or discharge circuit is interrupted. One of its features is also a pickup device. The robots can move around quietly, too, as their original purpose was to guard the campsite. When Alan continues to escape from them, it is revealed that the robots can communicate with each other and the camp computer. The communication works by using radio waves, but it is possible to interrupt these waves using a pocket blaster. ",
        "Summary_2": "Killer robots are the invention of one of the scientists from Alan's team. Their fundamental feature is the elimination of the particularly dangerous living creatures to ensure the safe residence of people on an unknown planet. They respond to brain impulses and shoot towards a live target. Although the scientists believed that robots were programmed to kill only animals, birds, and insects that lived in the jungle and carried an immediate danger to humans, Alan understands from his own experience that robots are defective. Armed with electric blasters, small exterminators move on quiet tracks for better contact with the ground, the killer robots immediately becoming the main danger for people living there. When one of their fighters falls, they can communicate via radio transmitters. Wirelessly, the robots summon new robots to the battlefield for assistance. However, during the fight, Alan deduces that the robots need a few seconds to reset the sight and debug the direction of the shot. Moreover, Alan throws a handful of dirt with swarming insects at the robot, which confuses the robot's settings, making it adjust its aim in the direction of its primary target, winning Alan a few seconds to retreat and save the planet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The killer robots are robots that were made by the exploration crew in order to have them hunt and kill the native animals of the planet. These robots don\u2019t rely on a camera for vision, instead they sense live creatures using their heartbeats and other types of characteristics. They can also communicate with each other, which is how Alan was found by the other robots after defeating the first one. They hold large blasters and are controlled by the ship\u2019s main computer. Alan was able to defeat them by shutting down the computer of the ship. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Alan\u2019s colleague, Pete,  has been assembling killer robots that would hunt animals by picking up their brain waves and quickly locating the animal. Apparently, he hasn\u2019t excluded humans\u2019 brain activity from the robots\u2019 targets. Now, these metal killers are taught to kill all living flesh, including people. They have blaster barrels, move around on quiet treads, can communicate via radio, and are automatically controlled by the main camp computer. The radio transmission is disrupted by blaster static blanks which disables the robots for a few seconds. The only way to turn them off is to disconnect them from the computer or switch off the computer itself. "

Who cares about that?\"\n  \n \n  He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself\nthan to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into\nyour caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n  \n \n  I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with\na fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n  \n \n  Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of\ncourse not!\"\n  \n \n  \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same\nstupidity. Listen, you!

        "Summary_1": "The story is set on the jungle planet of Waiamea. There are tall moss-shrouded trees and wrist-thick vines that hang similar to a monstrous tree-bound octopus. Fitful little plants grow straggly in the shadows of the mossy trunks, and the sun is blue. The campsite that Alan goes to houses power supplies, one central computer, and sleeping quarters. There are also a variety of animals that live on the planet. Some of these animals include feline creatures and insects attracted by the scent of blood. The planet also has a double moon when it becomes night time. When Alan escapes from the robot, he ends up in a stream of water and mud. As he runs towards the headquarters building, there is a small insect pile that he takes advantage of against the robot.

Alan looks around at the shadows entwined with vines, listening to the quiet rustle and faint crackling of the branches of life in the jungle. As he made his way into the tropical forest at noon, the sun filtered through the branches. As the planet approached evening, the shadows were long and gloomy. As the planet's double moon is visible, Alan sees how the jungle flashed bright blue and then hazes in the blink of an eye. The twin moons cast pale shadows, faintly conveying what was under Alan's feet. He stumbled over hidden debris, and sharp-edged growths tore at his face and clothes while insects attracted by blood clung to his pants and shirt. His arm slipped into something sticky that spread over his forearm, causing him to scream in agony. Black spots scraped off the branches and vines, but the rest slowly spread over his arm, painfully, like hot burning acid. Retreating, Alan stumbled upon the bank of a stream in the dim light of the moons. The banks were loose and muddy. The jungle growing along the edges of the water seemed to be one shaggy whole, complementing the picture with the unknown. As Alan flees from the attacking robots, he notices stars in the distance as a sign that a campsite is nearby. After about fifty yards of grass, there was the headquarters building. Alan wakes up in a bright white room, surrounded by familiar faces.",
        "Summary_3": "The story is located on a planet that humans want to settle on. The planet has a very large jungle, filled with very tall trees and insects. The planet is full of these insects, with Alan using them to his advantage and distracting a Robot. The jungle has a large clearing, which is where the exploration party landed their ship, and where the robots seem to be clustered. The jungle also has a lot of bushes and ferns that have sharp edges, and hurt Alan.",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set in the future where people are moving to another planet called Waiamea. It\u2019s covered in jungle forest and that\u2019s where Alan - one of the first 11 colonists that already landed -  is when he hears some strange blaster noise. After noticing the killing robots at the camp and realizing what situation he is in, Alan runs through the jungle while being chased by a robot and ends up on a stream bank where he manages to disable the metal killer. Then he tries to get back to the camp where he can turn off the main computer controlling these robots. He overcomes different jungle obstacles and fires at robots while trying to get to the computer room. Finally, he jumps towards the switch right before losing consciousness. At the end, three days later, Alan wakes up in a hospital-like white room where he finally hugs his crying wife Peggy after learning from the doctor that he did hit the switch and, thus, the robots are not a danger anymore. \n"

Alan stopped,\npuzzled. Two more blasts, quickly\ntogether, and the sound of a\nscream faintly.\n  \n \n  Frowning, worrying about the\nsounds, Alan momentarily forgot\nto watch his step until his foot\nsuddenly plunged into an ant\nhill, throwing him to the jungle\nfloor. \"Damn!\" He cursed again,\nfor the tenth time, and stood\nuncertainly in the dimness.\nFrom tall, moss-shrouded trees,\nwrist-thick vines hung quietly,\nscraping the spongy ground like\nthe tentacles of some monstrous\ntree-bound octopus. Fitful little\nplants grew straggly in the\nshadows of the mossy trunks,\nforming a dense underbrush that\nmade walking difficult. At midday\nsome few of the blue sun's\nrays filtered through to the\njungle floor, but now, late afternoon\non the planet, the shadows\nwere long and gloomy.\n  \n \n  Alan peered around him at the\nvine-draped shadows, listening\nto the soft rustlings and faint\ntwig-snappings of life in the\njungle. Two short, popping\nsounds echoed across the stillness,\ndrowned out almost immediately\nand silenced by an\nexplosive crash. Alan started,\n\"Blaster fighting! But it can't\nbe!\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly anxious, he slashed\na hurried X in one of the trees\nto mark his position then turned\nto follow a line of similar marks\nback through the jungle. He\ntried to run, but vines blocked\nhis way and woody shrubs\ncaught at his legs, tripping him\nand holding him back. Then,\nthrough the trees he saw the\nclearing of the camp site, the\ntemporary home for the scout\nship and the eleven men who,\nwith Alan, were the only humans\non the jungle planet, Waiamea.\n  \n \n \n  Stepping through the low\nshrubbery at the edge of the\nsite, he looked across the open\narea to the two temporary structures,\nthe camp headquarters\nwhere the power supplies and\nthe computer were; and the\nsleeping quarters. Beyond, nose\nhigh, stood the silver scout ship\nthat had brought the advance\nexploratory party of scientists\nand technicians to Waiamea\nthree days before. Except for a\nfew of the killer robots rolling\nslowly around the camp site on\ntheir quiet treads, there was no\none about.\n  \n \n  \"So, they've finally got those\nthings working.\" Alan smiled\nslightly. \"Guess that means I\nowe Pete a bourbon-and-soda\nfor sure. Anybody who can\nbuild a robot that hunts by homing\nin on animals' mind impulses ...\"\nHe stepped forward\njust as a roar of blue flame dissolved\nthe branches of a tree,\nbarely above his head.\n  \n \n  Without pausing to think,\nAlan leaped back, and fell\nsprawling over a bush just as\none of the robots rolled silently\nup from the right, lowering its\nblaster barrel to aim directly at\nhis head. Alan froze. \"My God,\nPete built those things wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly a screeching whirlwind\nof claws and teeth hurled\nitself from the smoldering\nbranches and crashed against the\nrobot, clawing insanely at the\nantenna and blaster barrel.\nWith an awkward jerk the robot\nswung around and fired its blaster,\ncompletely dissolving the\nlower half of the cat creature\nwhich had clung across the barrel.\nBut the back pressure of the\ncat's body overloaded the discharge\ncircuits. The robot started\nto shake, then clicked sharply\nas an overload relay snapped\nand shorted the blaster cells.\nThe killer turned and rolled back\ntowards the camp, leaving Alan\nalone.\n  \n \n  Shakily, Alan crawled a few\nfeet back into the undergrowth\nwhere he could lie and watch the\ncamp, but not himself be seen.\nThough visibility didn't make\nany difference to the robots, he\nfelt safer, somehow, hidden. He\nknew now what the shooting\nsounds had been and why there\nhadn't been anyone around the\ncamp site. A charred blob lying\nin the grass of the clearing confirmed\nhis hypothesis. His stomach\nfelt sick.\n  \n \n  \"I suppose,\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"that Pete assembled\nthese robots in a batch and then\nactivated them all at once, probably\nnever living to realize that\nthey're tuned to pick up human\nbrain waves, too. Damn!\nDamn!\" His eyes blurred and\nhe slammed his fist into the soft\nearth.\n  \n \n  When he raised his eyes again\nthe jungle was perceptibly darker.\nStealthy rustlings in the\nshadows grew louder with the\nsetting sun. Branches snapped\nunaccountably in the trees overhead\nand every now and then\nleaves or a twig fell softly to the\nground, close to where he lay.\nReaching into his jacket, Alan\nfingered his pocket blaster. He\npulled it out and held it in his\nright hand. \"This pop gun\nwouldn't even singe a robot, but\nit just might stop one of those\npumas.\"\n  \n \n  They said the blast with your name on it would find\nyou anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.\n  \n \n  Slowly Alan looked around,\nsizing up his situation. Behind\nhim the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.\nHe shuddered. \"Not a\nvery healthy spot to spend the\nnight. On the other hand, I certainly\ncan't get to the camp with\na pack of mind-activated mechanical\nkillers running around.\nIf I can just hold out until morning,\nwhen the big ship arrives ...\nThe big ship! Good\nLord, Peggy!\" He turned white;\noily sweat punctuated his forehead.\nPeggy, arriving tomorrow\nwith the other colonists, the\nwives and kids! The metal killers,\ntuned to blast any living\nflesh, would murder them the\ninstant they stepped from the\nship!\n  \n \n \n  A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl\nhe'd married just three weeks\nago. He still couldn't believe it.\nIt was crazy, he supposed, to\nmarry a girl and then take off\nfor an unknown planet, with her\nto follow, to try to create a home\nin a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,\nbut Peggy and her green eyes\nthat changed color with the\nlight, with her soft brown hair,\nand her happy smile, had ended\nthirty years of loneliness and\nhad, at last, given him a reason\nfor living. \"Not to be killed!\"\nAlan unclenched his fists and\nwiped his palms, bloody where\nhis fingernails had dug into the\nflesh.\n  \n \n  There was a slight creak above\nhim like the protesting of a\nbranch too heavily laden. Blaster\nready, Alan rolled over onto his\nback. In the movement, his elbow\nstruck the top of a small\nearthy mound and he was instantly\nengulfed in a swarm of\nlocust-like insects that beat disgustingly\nagainst his eyes and\nmouth. \"Fagh!\" Waving his\narms before his face he jumped\nup and backwards, away from\nthe bugs. As he did so, a dark\nshapeless thing plopped from\nthe trees onto the spot where he\nhad been lying stretched out.\nThen, like an ambient fungus,\nit slithered off into the jungle\nundergrowth.\n  \n \n  For a split second the jungle\nstood frozen in a brilliant blue\nflash, followed by the sharp report\nof a blaster. Then another.\nAlan whirled, startled. The\nplanet's double moon had risen\nand he could see a robot rolling\nslowly across the clearing in his\ngeneral direction, blasting indiscriminately\nat whatever mind\nimpulses came within its pickup\nrange, birds, insects, anything.\nSix or seven others also left the\ncamp headquarters area and\nheaded for the jungle, each to a\nslightly different spot.\n  \n \n  Apparently the robot hadn't\nsensed him yet, but Alan didn't\nknow what the effective range\nof its pickup devices was. He\nbegan to slide back into the\njungle. Minutes later, looking\nback he saw that the machine,\nthough several hundred yards\naway, had altered its course and\nwas now headed directly for\nhim.\n  \n \n  His stomach tightened. Panic.\nThe dank, musty smell of the\njungle seemed for an instant to\nthicken and choke in his throat.\nThen he thought of the big ship\nlanding in the morning, settling\ndown slowly after a lonely two-week\nvoyage. He thought of a\nbrown-haired girl crowding with\nthe others to the gangway, eager\nto embrace the new planet, and\nthe next instant a charred nothing,\nunrecognizable, the victim\nof a design error or a misplaced\nwire in a machine. \"I have to\ntry,\" he said aloud. \"I have to\ntry.\" He moved into the blackness.\n  \n \n  Powerful as a small tank, the\nkiller robot was equipped to\ncrush, slash, and burn its way\nthrough undergrowth. Nevertheless,\nit was slowed by the\nlarger trees and the thick, clinging\nvines, and Alan found that\nhe could manage to keep ahead\nof it, barely out of blaster range.\nOnly, the robot didn't get tired.\nAlan did.\n  \n \n  The twin moons cast pale, deceptive\nshadows that wavered\nand danced across the jungle\nfloor, hiding debris that tripped\nhim and often sent him sprawling\ninto the dark. Sharp-edged\ngrowths tore at his face and\nclothes, and insects attracted by\nthe blood matted against his\npants and shirt. Behind, the robot\ncrashed imperturbably after\nhim, lighting the night with fitful\nblaster flashes as some\nwinged or legged life came within\nits range.\n  \n \n  There was movement also, in\nthe darkness beside him, scrapings\nand rustlings and an occasional\nlow, throaty sound like an\nangry cat. Alan's fingers tensed\non his pocket blaster. Swift\nshadowy forms moved quickly in\nthe shrubs and the growling became\nsuddenly louder. He fired\ntwice, blindly, into the undergrowth.\nSharp screams punctuated\nthe electric blue discharge as\na pack of small feline creatures\nleaped snarling and clawing\nback into the night.\n  \n \n \n  Mentally, Alan tried to figure\nthe charge remaining in his blaster.\nThere wouldn't be much.\n\"Enough for a few more shots,\nmaybe. Why the devil didn't I\nload in fresh cells this morning!\"\n  \n \n  The robot crashed on, louder\nnow, gaining on the tired human.\nLegs aching and bruised,\nstinging from insect bites, Alan\ntried to force himself to run\nholding his hands in front of\nhim like a child in the dark. His\nfoot tripped on a barely visible\ninsect hill and a winged swarm\nexploded around him. Startled,\nAlan jerked sideways, crashing\nhis head against a tree. He\nclutched at the bark for a second,\ndazed, then his knees\nbuckled. His blaster fell into the\nshadows.\n  \n \n  The robot crashed loudly behind\nhim now. Without stopping\nto think, Alan fumbled along the\nground after his gun, straining\nhis eyes in the darkness. He\nfound it just a couple of feet to\none side, against the base of a\nsmall bush. Just as his fingers\nclosed upon the barrel his other\nhand slipped into something\nsticky that splashed over his\nforearm. He screamed in pain\nand leaped back, trying frantically\nto wipe the clinging,\nburning blackness off his arm.\nPatches of black scraped off onto\nbranches and vines, but the rest\nspread slowly over his arm as\nagonizing as hot acid, or as flesh\nbeing ripped away layer by\nlayer.\n  \n \n  Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,\nAlan stumbled forward.\nSharp muscle spasms shot from\nhis shoulder across his back and\nchest. Tears streamed across his\ncheeks.\n  \n \n  A blue arc slashed at the trees\na mere hundred yards behind.\nHe screamed at the blast. \"Damn\nyou, Pete! Damn your robots!\nDamn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!\"\nHe stepped into emptiness.\n  \n \n  Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed\nby the water, the pain began to\nfall away. He wanted to lie there\nforever in the dark, cool, wetness.\nFor ever, and ever, and ...\nThe air thundered.\n  \n \n  In the dim light he could see\nthe banks of the stream, higher\nthan a man, muddy and loose.\nGrowing right to the edge of the\nbanks, the jungle reached out\nwith hairy, disjointed arms as\nif to snag even the dirty little\nstream that passed so timidly\nthrough its domain.\n  \n \n  Alan, lying in the mud of the\nstream bed, felt the earth shake\nas the heavy little robot rolled\nslowly and inexorably towards\nhim. \"The Lord High Executioner,\"\nhe thought, \"in battle\ndress.\" He tried to stand but his\nlegs were almost too weak and\nhis arm felt numb. \"I'll drown\nhim,\" he said aloud. \"I'll drown\nthe Lord High Executioner.\" He\nlaughed. Then his mind cleared.\nHe remembered where he was.\n  \n \n \n  Alan trembled. For the first\ntime in his life he understood\nwhat it was to live, because for\nthe first time he realized that he\nwould sometime die. In other\ntimes and circumstances he\nmight put it off for a while, for\nmonths or years, but eventually,\nas now, he would have to watch,\nstill and helpless, while death\ncame creeping. Then, at thirty,\nAlan became a man.\n  \n \n  \"Dammit, no law says I have\nto flame-out\n   \n   now\n   \n  !\" He forced\nhimself to rise, forced his legs\nto stand, struggling painfully in\nthe shin-deep ooze. He worked\nhis way to the bank and began to\ndig frenziedly, chest high, about\ntwo feet below the edge.\n  \n \n  His arm where the black thing\nhad been was swollen and tender,\nbut he forced his hands to dig,\ndig, dig, cursing and crying to\nhide the pain, and biting his\nlips, ignoring the salty taste of\nblood. The soft earth crumbled\nunder his hands until he had a\nsmall cave about three feet deep\nin the bank. Beyond that the\nsoil was held too tightly by the\nroots from above and he had to\nstop.\n  \n \n \n  The air crackled blue and a\ntree crashed heavily past Alan\ninto the stream. Above him on\nthe bank, silhouetting against\nthe moons, the killer robot stopped\nand its blaster swivelled\nslowly down. Frantically, Alan\nhugged the bank as a shaft of\npure electricity arced over him,\nsliced into the water, and exploded\nin a cloud of steam. The\nrobot shook for a second, its\nblaster muzzle lifted erratically\nand for an instant it seemed almost\nout of control, then it\nquieted and the muzzle again\npointed down.\n  \n \n  Pressing with all his might,\nAlan slid slowly along the bank\ninches at a time, away from the\nmachine above. Its muzzle turned\nto follow him but the edge of\nthe bank blocked its aim. Grinding\nforward a couple of feet,\nslightly overhanging the bank,\nthe robot fired again. For a split\nsecond Alan seemed engulfed in\nflame; the heat of hell singed his\nhead and back, and mud boiled\nin the bank by his arm.\n  \n \n  Again the robot trembled. It\njerked forward a foot and its\nblaster swung slightly away. But\nonly for a moment. Then the gun\nswung back again.\n  \n \n  Suddenly, as if sensing something\nwrong, its tracks slammed\ninto reverse. It stood poised for\na second, its treads spinning\ncrazily as the earth collapsed underneath\nit, where Alan had\ndug, then it fell with a heavy\nsplash into the mud, ten feet\nfrom where Alan stood.\n  \n \n  Without hesitation Alan\nthrew himself across the blaster\nhousing, frantically locking his\narms around the barrel as the\nrobot's treads churned furiously\nin the sticky mud, causing it to\nbuck and plunge like a Brahma\nbull. The treads stopped and the\nblaster jerked upwards wrenching\nAlan's arms, then slammed\ndown. Then the whole housing\nwhirled around and around, tilting\nalternately up and down like\na steel-skinned water monster\ntrying to dislodge a tenacious\ncrab, while Alan, arms and legs\nwrapped tightly around the blaster\nbarrel and housing, pressed\nfiercely against the robot's metal\nskin.\n  \n \n  Slowly, trying to anticipate\nand shift his weight with the\nspinning plunges, Alan worked\nhis hand down to his right hip.\nHe fumbled for the sheath clipped\nto his belt, found it, and extracted\na stubby hunting knife.\nSweat and blood in his eyes,\nhardly able to move on the wildly\nswinging turret, he felt down\nthe sides to the thin crack between\nthe revolving housing and\nthe stationary portion of the robot.\nWith a quick prayer he\njammed in the knife blade\u2014and\nwas whipped headlong into the\nmud as the turret literally snapped\nto a stop.\n  \n \n  The earth, jungle and moons\nspun in a pinwheeled blur,\nslowed, and settled to their proper\nplaces. Standing in the sticky,\nsweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed\nthe robot apprehensively. Half\nburied in mud, it stood quiet in\nthe shadowy light except for an\noccasional, almost spasmodic\njerk of its blaster barrel. For\nthe first time that night Alan\nallowed himself a slight smile.\n\"A blade in the old gear box,\neh? How does that feel, boy?\"\n  \n \n  He turned. \"Well, I'd better\nget out of here before the knife\nslips or the monster cooks up\nsome more tricks with whatever\nit's got for a brain.\" Digging\nlittle footholds in the soft bank,\nhe climbed up and stood once\nagain in the rustling jungle\ndarkness.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"how\nPete could cram enough brain\ninto one of those things to make\nit hunt and track so perfectly.\"\nHe tried to visualize the computing\ncircuits needed for the\noperation of its tracking mechanism\nalone. \"There just isn't\nroom for the electronics. You'd\nneed a computer as big as the\none at camp headquarters.\"\n  \n \n \n  In the distance the sky blazed\nas a blaster roared in the jungle.\nThen Alan heard the approaching\nrobot, crunching and snapping\nits way through the undergrowth\nlike an onrushing forest\nfire. He froze. \"Good Lord!\nThey communicate with each\nother! The one I jammed must\nbe calling others to help.\"\n  \n \n  He began to move along the\nbank, away from the crashing\nsounds. Suddenly he stopped, his\neyes widened. \"Of course! Radio!\nI'll bet anything they're\nautomatically controlled by the\ncamp computer. That's where\ntheir brain is!\" He paused.\n\"Then, if that were put out of\ncommission ...\" He jerked away\nfrom the bank and half ran, half\npulled himself through the undergrowth\ntowards the camp.\n  \n \n  Trees exploded to his left as\nanother robot fired in his direction,\ntoo far away to be effective\nbut churning towards him\nthrough the blackness.\n  \n \n  Alan changed direction slightly\nto follow a line between the\ntwo robots coming up from\neither side, behind him. His eyes\nwere well accustomed to the dark\nnow, and he managed to dodge\nmost of the shadowy vines and\nbranches before they could snag\nor trip him. Even so, he stumbled\nin the wiry underbrush and\nhis legs were a mass of stinging\nslashes from ankle to thigh.\n  \n \n  The crashing rumble of the\nkiller robots shook the night behind\nhim, nearer sometimes,\nthen falling slightly back, but\nfollowing constantly, more\nunshakable than bloodhounds\nbecause a man can sometimes cover\na scent, but no man can stop his\nthoughts. Intermittently, like\nphotographers' strobes, blue\nflashes would light the jungle\nabout him. Then, for seconds\nafterwards his eyes would see\ndancing streaks of yellow and\nsharp multi-colored pinwheels\nthat alternately shrunk and expanded\nas if in a surrealist's\nnightmare. Alan would have to\npause and squeeze his eyelids\ntight shut before he could see\nagain, and the robots would\nmove a little closer.\n  \n \n  To his right the trees silhouetted\nbriefly against brilliance as\na third robot slowly moved up\nin the distance. Without thinking,\nAlan turned slightly to the\nleft, then froze in momentary\npanic. \"I should be at the camp\nnow. Damn, what direction am\nI going?\" He tried to think\nback, to visualize the twists and\nturns he'd taken in the jungle.\n\"All I need is to get lost.\"\n  \n \n  He pictured the camp computer\nwith no one to stop it, automatically\nsending its robots in\nwider and wider forays, slowly\nwiping every trace of life from\nthe planet. Technologically advanced\nmachines doing the job\nfor which they were built, completely,\nthoroughly, without feeling,\nand without human masters\nto separate sense from futility.\nFinally parts would wear out,\ncircuits would short, and one by\none the killers would crunch to\na halt. A few birds would still\nfly then, but a unique animal\nlife, rare in the universe, would\nexist no more. And the bones of\nchildren, eager girls, and their\nmen would also lie, beside a\nrusty hulk, beneath the alien\nsun.\n  \n \n  \"Peggy!\"\n  \n \n  As if in answer, a tree beside\nhim breathed fire, then exploded.\nIn the brief flash of the\nblaster shot, Alan saw the steel\nglint of a robot only a hundred\nyards away, much nearer than\nhe had thought. \"Thank heaven\nfor trees!\" He stepped back, felt\nhis foot catch in something,\nclutched futilely at some leaves\nand fell heavily.\n  \n \n  Pain danced up his leg as he\ngrabbed his ankle. Quickly he\nfelt the throbbing flesh. \"Damn\nthe rotten luck, anyway!\" He\nblinked the pain tears from his\neyes and looked up\u2014into a robot's\nblaster, jutting out of the\nfoliage, thirty yards away.\n  \n \n \n  Instinctively, in one motion\nAlan grabbed his pocket blaster\nand fired. To his amazement the\nrobot jerked back, its gun wobbled\nand started to tilt away.\nThen, getting itself under control,\nit swung back again to face\nAlan. He fired again, and again\nthe robot reacted. It seemed familiar\nsomehow. Then he remembered\nthe robot on the river\nbank, jiggling and swaying for\nseconds after each shot. \"Of\ncourse!\" He cursed himself for\nmissing the obvious. \"The blaster\nstatic blanks out radio\ntransmission from the computer\nfor a few seconds. They even do\nit to themselves!\"\n  \n \n  Firing intermittently, he\npulled himself upright and hobbled\nahead through the bush.\nThe robot shook spasmodically\nwith each shot, its gun tilted upward\nat an awkward angle.\n  \n \n  Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw\nstars, real stars brilliant in the\nnight sky, and half dragging his\nswelling leg he stumbled out of\nthe jungle into the camp clearing.\nAhead, across fifty yards of\ngrass stood the headquarters\nbuilding, housing the robot-controlling\ncomputer. Still firing at\nshort intervals he started across\nthe clearing, gritting his teeth\nat every step.\n  \n \n  Straining every muscle in\nspite of the agonizing pain, Alan\nforced himself to a limping run\nacross the uneven ground, carefully\navoiding the insect hills\nthat jutted up through the grass.\nFrom the corner of his eye he\nsaw another of the robots standing\nshakily in the dark edge of\nthe jungle waiting, it seemed,\nfor his small blaster to run dry.\n  \n \n  \"Be damned! You can't win\nnow!\" Alan yelled between blaster\nshots, almost irrational from\nthe pain that ripped jaggedly\nthrough his leg. Then it happened.\nA few feet from the\nbuilding's door his blaster quit.\nA click. A faint hiss when he\nfrantically jerked the trigger\nagain and again, and the spent\ncells released themselves from\nthe device, falling in the grass\nat his feet. He dropped the useless\ngun.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" He threw himself on\nthe ground as a new robot suddenly\nappeared around the edge\nof the building a few feet away,\naimed, and fired. Air burned\nover Alan's back and ozone tingled\nin his nostrils.\n  \n \n  Blinding itself for a few seconds\nwith its own blaster static,\nthe robot paused momentarily,\njiggling in place. In this\ninstant, Alan jammed his hands\ninto an insect hill and hurled the\npile of dirt and insects directly\nat the robot's antenna. In a flash,\nhundreds of the winged things\nerupted angrily from the hole in\na swarming cloud, each part of\nwhich was a speck of life\ntransmitting mental energy to the\nrobot's pickup devices.\n  \n \n  Confused by the sudden dispersion\nof mind impulses, the\nrobot fired erratically as Alan\ncrouched and raced painfully for\nthe door. It fired again, closer,\nas he fumbled with the lock\nrelease. Jagged bits of plastic and\nstone ripped past him, torn loose\nby the blast.\n  \n \n  Frantically, Alan slammed\nopen the door as the robot, sensing\nhim strongly now, aimed\npoint blank. He saw nothing, his\nmind thought of nothing but the\nred-clad safety switch mounted\nbeside the computer. Time stopped.\nThere was nothing else in\nthe world. He half-jumped, half-fell\ntowards it, slowly, in tenths\nof seconds that seemed measured\nout in years.\n  \n \n  The universe went black.\n  \n \n  Later. Brilliance pressed upon\nhis eyes. Then pain returned, a\nmulti-hurting thing that crawled\nthrough his body and dragged\nragged tentacles across his\nbrain. He moaned.\n  \n \n  A voice spoke hollowly in the\ndistance. \"He's waking. Call his\nwife.\"\n  \n \n  Alan opened his eyes in a\nwhite room; a white light hung\nover his head. Beside him, looking\ndown with a rueful smile,\nstood a young man wearing\nspace medical insignia. \"Yes,\"\nhe acknowledged the question in\nAlan's eyes, \"you hit the switch.\nThat was three days ago. When\nyou're up again we'd all like to\nthank you.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly a sobbing-laughing\ngreen-eyed girl was pressed\ntightly against him. Neither of\nthem spoke. They couldn't. There\nwas too much to say.\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n October 1958.

        "Summary_1": "Alan\u2019s realization that he must continue to live makes him become a man at thirty. Not only does it fill him with determination, but it is also what fuels him to stop the robots and end up saving everybody. He declares that no law says he has to flame-out at this age, so he continues to work his way through the jungle and against the robots. Without this realization, he would not have been motivated to use his pocket blaster against the robots and knife. Alan would also not have lived long enough to figure out the control of the robots as the computer in the headquarters building. This, itself, also lets him actually choose to go back to the area at the risk of death to find the safety button. Finally, his will to live lets him put aside his fear and goes to push the button, which ends up saving everybody. ",
        "Summary_2": "For Alan, nothing is more important than to continue his struggle throughout the work. The researcher faces insurmountable obstacles such as fights with a puma, a sticky unknown that burns through his skin, escape from killer robots, and the difficulty of making his way through the thick jungle. Although the reader points out that it takes traits like perseverance, bravery, strength, and endurance to survive in the relentless tropical forest, Alan\u2019s character is not the only condition keeping him motivated. The main character realizes that the overwhelming responsibility lies on his shoulders, realizing that the lives of children and women depend on his actions and tactics. Furthermore, Alan obtains a second wind when reminiscing about his loving wife Peggy; he shares that Peggy has brought light into his dark world, giving him the willpower to push through and fight for a better future. Even at the end, when his strength leaves his body, he decides to fight through the pain and stop the inevitable nightmare, clearing the jungle out of killer robots.",
        "Summary_3": "Before reaching the ship, Alan fought that he was going to die, and that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to shut off the killer robots. He accepts this death, but just as the robot was going to kill him he thinks about his wife. He realizes that if he dies, the robots would kill the settlers when they arrive. This pushes him to continue fighting, and when he does the defeats the robots and saves the settlers.",
        "Summary_4": "As one of the first colonists of the planet, Alan realizes that he must continue to live to save his beloved wife and all the other people traveling with her on the ship right now because they are the only humans left in this world. When pain clouds his rational judgment, and he cannot walk anymore, the feelings of love and responsibility enable him to move further. He disables one robot and, after all, switches off the computer that controls all the other ones. Even though his body is in agonizing pain, his realization makes him move forward and practically save everyone who is to land on the planet on the next day, save humanity in a sense.\n\n"

        "Query": "What happens in THE LITTLE RED BAG story?",
        "Article": "The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I\nstared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented\nit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I\nwas ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with\nhis eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it\ntoward me.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the\nremaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But\nhe was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n  \n \n  I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n  \n \n  He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance\nand put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying\nover.\n  \n \n  \"Cab?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n  \n \n  Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n  \n \n  I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage\nclaim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran\nthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied\nme.\n  \n \n  I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a\nman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing\nsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could\nI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the\nbag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to\nlive with myself.\n  \n \n  No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014until\nwhat?\n  \n \n  A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of\nthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a\npair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could\ntell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the\nwhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own\nbusiness.\n  \n \n  But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started\nacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,\n\"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But\nI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim\ncounter out of the side of my eye.\n  \n \n  The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp\nto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went\ninside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag\non the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The\nclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n  \n \n  I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How\nmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the\ncounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I\nhad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the\nclock again.\n  \n \n  \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n  \n \n  \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n  \n \n  I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the\ncounter and reached out for the wheel.

        "Summary_1": "On a seemingly normal flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles sits our protagonist, on his way to complete a printing order. In his initial musings, we find out that his curiosity and intuition about his fellow passengers come out of his extrasensory ability to see inside objects and human beings. The protagonist is also revealed to be able to manipulate time by stopping clocks, which he uses to his benefit with early wake-up calls. Despite his unique abilities, he laments that it renders largely useless and mundane as it often ruins surprises like Christmas gifts, requires a bit of guessing, and fails to work as gimmicks in manipulating games like Vegas slot machines. \n\nAnd so with his seemingly useless but curious gaze, the protagonist ponders about his seat-mate\u2019s purse, Amos Magaffey the purchasing agent, and rifling through luggages and identifying his own. All of sudden, his musings are halted by the discovery of a bomb in one of the luggages, with a countdown timer ticking with 10 minutes or less. The flight is still 40 minutes away from its destination and so with great effort and increasing suspicion from his seat-mate, the protagonist uses his ability to stop the ticking bomb. The flight lands safely with the bomb remaining inactivated, but the protgaonist now worries between alerting authorities - which may cast suspicion upon himself - or follow the luggage and identify who picks it up. With no one initially picking up the luggage with the bomb - the little red bag - it is delivered by the flight attendant to the rear room. Soon, a young lady arrives to pick it up. It is then that the protagonist hurries over to her in hopes of warning her of the ticking time bomb. It turns out that the likely culprit of planting the bomb is the young lady\u2019s - Julia Claremont - husband, whose motives are unknown but nevertheless unhinged. Armed with this information and a false story about the bag\u2019s suspicion, the pair decides to approach an airport policeman and inform them of the bomb. However, as they return to where they left their bags, they find that both his and Julia\u2019s luggages have been stolen by a strange man entering his grey vehicle. Turning to the airport policeman in reporting this stolen luggage, they are interrupted by an explosion in a grey vehicle. Shocked and somber, Julia and the protagonist inform the policeman that they no longer wish to report the stolen luggage, and the two begin to walk away from the airport. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The protagonist and narrator of the story is a man who long ago discovered that he had an extraordinary ability: sensing the contents of different objects, like boxes and bags, and moving light things, like feathers or a watch balance wheel, without touching them. He got in trouble for naively using his gift in the fourth grade and has kept quiet about it ever since. At the beginning of the story, he is on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles for a business meeting with an amusement chain owner. After studying the passengers around him, checking the window view, and mentally looking through the purse of a woman next to him, he decides to find his suitcase in the luggage compartment of the plane. The narrator is going through the content of other people\u2019s suitcases when he feels something resembling a bomb. It seems to be inside a small woman\u2019s bag and is about to go off in ten minutes, but the plane is supposed to land only in forty. Anxious and hectic, he refuses the cup of coffee from a stewardess and decides that he has to stop the clock mechanism, at least for the duration of the flight. He does it every morning with his alarm, so it doesn\u2019t seem impossible. After temporarily stopping it, his thoughts race ahead to the landing, realizing that he wouldn\u2019t be able to control the mechanism forever or tell the truth to the police. But his thinking process is disturbed by turbulence - he realizes that the balance wheel is moving again. After some tugging, pulling, and shoving, it finally becomes immovable. When the plane lands, the protagonist goes to the baggage claim and tries to find the owner of the bag. After picking up his suitcase and watching how the claim employees take the bag with the bomb to the storage room, he finally sees a blond woman called Julia Claremont - he saw her on the flight - approaching the counter. He convinces her to put the bag down and pretends that he is speaking to someone in a telephone booth while deactivating the mechanism once again. When she asks for an explanation, he invites her to an airport coffee shop and tells her everything. At the end of his monologue, she starts crying and says that her husband Joe probably put it in her bag after she had finished packing the day before. That trip was Joe\u2019s idea, but she doesn\u2019t know why her husband would do something like that. They go back to the gate to realize that the bags they had left there are gone. The protagonist sees the thief throw their bags into his car\u2019s rear seat and rapidly drive off. When they are ready to go to the police office to file a report, a loud explosion occurs somewhere near the airport. Julia and the narrator don\u2019t report luggage theft and walk away. \n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The protagonist finishes reading the Chronicle an hour into his flight when he sees a sea of clouds where the San Joaquin Valley should be. He observes a few passengers and sees a familiar blonde from the gate. He thinks about the printing order in Los Angeles and begins exploring the old lady\u2019s purse next to them. The protagonist's powers allow him to explore the inside of anything, but he remarks that it is not any fun because all he does is feel the shapes and guess. He goes through the lady\u2019s belongings and becomes disappointed when nothing is of interest. The scene cuts to the fourth-grade protagonist eating lunch with Miss Winters for a minor infraction. Miss Winters leaves for a moment and tells the protagonist to erase the blackboard. She cannot find her favorite mechanical pencil when she comes back, and the protagonist probes her purse to find it. He generally keeps quiet about their special gift but can move certain objects. The old lady wakes up again, and the protagonist begins to think about securing a printing deal with Amos Magaffey. He probes through belongings and finds a bomb in a woman\u2019s bag. He begins to panic and thinks about what to do when a stewardess offers him a tray full of food; the protagonist cannot bring himself to accept it. The lady next to him is concerned, but he insists that he is okay and asks for a cup of coffee. The protagonist has temporarily stopped the timer, and he thinks about what will happen once the luggage begins to move because the timer will start again. As he concentrates, the old woman notices again and asks if he is sleeping. Once the plane stops, the protagonist leaves and observes the baggage being transported from the plane to find the bag with the bomb. Once the protagonist claims his baggage, he waits to see who will claim the bag with the bomb. Although he should be meeting with Amos Magaffey, he knows that he will be unable to live with himself if he lets the bomb explode. The blonde from earlier appears to claim her bag, and the protagonist stops her by saying that he has something important to tell her. He manages to stop the bomb timer again by pretending to dial a number in the telephone booth. He and the woman then go grab a coffee, where he explains the situation; she is horrified to realize that her husband Joe is the one who put the bomb in. She introduces herself as Julia Claremont, and the both of them pay the tab to leave. They realize that their bags are stolen by the dumpy man from earlier in the lobby. The redcap tells them to tell the policeman, while a loud explosion suddenly happens. The two of them decide to forego their luggage because of the bomb and walk down the street arm in arm. ",
        "Summary_4": "A man with extrasensory ability finds a bomb on the plane. He doesn\u2019t want to tell the stewardess that there is a bomb because he cannot explain how he knows it without exposing his ability. His unwillingness to reveal his ability also originates from his childhood memory that his teacher doubts him as a thief when he tells her where her pencil is. During the whole flight, he uses his ability to move the wheel in the bomb not to let it count down to explosion. \n\nAfter the plane lands, he goes to pick up his baggage. When he grabs his bag, he also sees the one with a bomb in the baggage claim area in the airport. He waits and hesitates to tell the truth to the airport officer. When he sees the baggage claim attendant trying to move the bag with the bomb to the rear room in the airport, he almost tells the truth, but he sees a woman come and try to find her bag. After the woman takes the bag, he approaches the woman, tells her to put the bag away, and goes to grab a coffee with her. He explains everything to her, including his extrasensory ability. The woman is startled. When they decide to tell the police to deactivate the bomb and walk out of the coffee shop, they see a thief grab both of their baggage and drive away. The police come and try to help them, but they all hear a massive explosion sound. They tell the police not to report the property stolen, and they leave.\n"

        "Summary_1": "The protagonist finds out about his extraordinary ability at an early age and quickly finds out that it is better to keep this information to himself. One incident that drove this message home occured in the fourth grade with his teacher, Miss Winters. At the time, the protagonist was sentenced to eat lunch with her as a minor punishment. After the lunch period was over, Miss Winters found herself looking for her favorite mechanical pencil, asking the class if anyone had seen it while casting a suspicious eye at the protagonist. Aiming to maintain his innocence and help out his teacher, the protagonist used his ability to find the pencil - in Miss Winters\u2019 purse all along - and let her know. Instead, he was rewarded with a note sent home. \n\nEver since then, he found it to be safer to keep his ability a secret. Despite his curiosities about other potential extraordinary individuals, he recognizes that revealing any information gained from his ability would only cast suspicion upon himself from the authorities. For example, had the protagonist immediately alerted a flight attendant or the authorities about a bomb in one of the luggages the moment he discovered it on the plane, intrusive questions about how he knew or suspicions about him being the one to plant it were highly likely to arise. \n",
        "Summary_2": "After using his gift in primary school and getting a stinging note for that, the protagonist decides to keep quiet about his ability. Even when he has to deal with a bomb he is still reluctant to share his secret because he thinks that his life would change forever and people would never trust him again since he would be considered a prying man. He doesn\u2019t believe that his gift can be used for anything meaningful, and ruining his life by revealing his ability definitely doesn\u2019t seem sensible to him. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The protagonist is reluctant to reveal his extraordinary ability because it will make him look suspicious. He has learned to keep quiet about it in the past because it will only cast disbelief on him. The incident with his fourth-grade teacher\u2019s mechanical pencil only made it seem like he had purposely hidden it in her purse. He has also thought about making money with the ability before, but it is not very useful because he can only feel around objects and guess what they are. Even though the protagonist feels panicked about the bomb, he knows that he cannot outright report it because nobody is aware of his ability. If he does, they will only cast suspicion on him for being the one who initially put it in there. Even when he thinks about calling ahead and convincing the authorities that he can stop the clock, there is no use. The protagonist knows that everybody will see him as a man who cannot be trusted once the secret is out and has prying eyes. ",
        "Summary_4": "The protagonist is reluctant to reveal his extrasensory ability because of his childhood experience. He learns the wisdom of not disclosing his power in the fourth grade when his teacher suspects him as a thief after he tells her where her pencil is. He used to believe that many other people have supernatural abilities like him, but the truth remains questionable. He does not want to reveal his ability because he believes that people will not believe him. Even if people believe him, his life will change, and he will become suspected of a prying person who always peeks at others\u2019 privacy."

        "Summary_1": "This story has two settings: first, on an airplane from San Francisco to Los Angeles and second, at the Los Angeles airport in the baggage claim and arrivals terminal. The first setting - on the airplane mid flight - is highly important to the story because it is here that the protagonist discovered the bomb in the luggage. Not only that, he discovers that bomb is on a countdown with 10 minutes remaining before detonation while the flight still has 40 minutes before arrival. It is due to this fact that the protagonist utilizes his time manipulation ability to stop the clock successfully. \n\nIn the second setting, the tensions in this story continue to rise. Despite the protagonist successfully stopping the clock in the air, it appears to continue on the ground. With both the anticipation of watching to see who picks up the little red bag and dodging suspicions from the airport policeman and workers, we can imagine the hectic and panicked energy that sometimes appears in baggage claims. Additionally, an airport is filled with many people arriving and departing, which adds to the pressure the protagonist is facing in dealing with deactivating the bomb before anyone gets hurt. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The first part of the story is happening on a plane that is flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles. When the protagonist finds the bomb in one of the bags in the luggage compartment, the plane is somewhere above the mountain range north of Los Angeles - even in theory, it is impossible to land because there are no airports around this area. He stops the clock mechanism, using his extraordinary ability. After the landing, the story continues in the building of the airport, where the protagonist finds the owner of the bag with the bomb - Julia Claremont. He tells her about the bomb and how he sensed it during the flight. She cries and tells him that her husband put it in her bag after she had finished packing. They go back to the lobby and see that their suitcases got stolen. The protagonist tries to chase the thief, but the man quickly drives off with the bags. When they decide to file a report, something explodes loudly near the airport, and Julia, together with the protagonist, walks away, refusing to report the theft. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story first begins on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The protagonist first expects to see San Joaquin Valley, but he is greeted by a sea of clouds instead. He sits next to an old woman on the plane. A little north of Bakersfield, he finds that one of the bags on the plane contains a bomb. It is forty minutes from Burbank to Lockheed Air Terminal, and there would be no place to land the plane any time soon. Once the protagonist gets off the plane, he heads to the baggage claim at the airport for his bag. When Julia gets her bag, he leads her to a telephone booth to make the fake call. Then, they leave their bags in the lobby and go to a coffee shop. The airport policeman is across the street from the parking lot. The setting of the plane is important because it is where the protagonist first discovers the bomb. Without his extraordinary ability to feel around any enclosed object, he would not be able to detect and temporarily stop the bomb\u2019s timer before it was too late. This is also significant because the plane would have exploded had he not found it. The airport is important too because that is where he meets Julia. He would not have figured out who the bag belonged to and the entire story without waiting at the airport. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story's setting is in an ordinary world where no extrasensory ability is found or known. This setting is essential because the protagonist has the extrasensory ability, which allows him to see the insides of things and move some very light objects with his mind. However, since the world does not know the existence of the ability, he cannot tell anyone about it because if he tells people the truth, people either do not believe him or see him as a freak. Furthermore, since he cannot tell anyone his ability, neither can he tell people about what he finds in any bags, like a bomb, because he cannot explain how he knows what is inside of things that do not belong to him. Therefore, this inability to reveal his extrasensory ability drives the story to progress."

My mind raced ahead to\nthe landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would\nstart again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.\nI considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe\ncalling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.\nMaybe I could convince them I could stop a clock\u2014but not before the\nbomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would\nbe changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man\nliterally with gimlet eyes.\n  \n \n  Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of\nthe city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,\nbut there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it\nwas also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.\n  \n \n  To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing\nmy eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging\nand pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.\n  \n \n  A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.\n  \n \n  \"Your cup,\" my seat partner said, pointing.\n  \n \n  I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I\nlooked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took\nit without a word and went away.\n  \n \n  \"Were you really asleep that time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to\nfits, but I didn't.\n  \n \n  It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest\nminutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when\nthe plane dipped and bumped to a landing.\n  \n \n  Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as\nunconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking\nthrough the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I\nhad my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.\nSo I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and\nwatch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield\ncarts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.\n  \n \n  It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained\nthe bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The\nassortment of bags\u2014a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors\u2014was\npacked in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where\nI was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the\nbalance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a\nramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded\nand placed in a long rack. I went with it.\n  \n \n  There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,\nand a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to\ndetermine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was\nthe attendant and I had two bags\u2014my own battered veteran of years, and\na fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.\n  \n \n  I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and\u2014a\nclock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.\n  \n \n  I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward\nand grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I\nentered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to\nimmobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The protagonist\u2019s relationship with authority figures - like the airport policeman in this story - is a double edged sword. On one hand, it is figures like the policeman who are the right figure to report his suspicions towards. They are the ones equipped with the knowledge and resources on how to deal with the bomb in the little red bag. More importantly, informing them is the right thing to do and would save the lives of everyone else at the airport. On the other hand, however, we can see that the protagonist has revealed that authority figures in the past often choose to cast suspicion upon him rather than appreciate the usefulness of the knowledge that comes about his ability. If the protagonist were to approach the policeman in a suspicious manner or reveal too much information about his know-how of the bomb, it is likely that they will suspect him to be the culprit and probe him on something he is unable to explain, and hence arrest him. The protagonist has to carefully consider the implications of either decision and try to optimize both the safety of others around him and his own. \n\nThe protagonist chooses to inform the policeman of a suspicious baggage situation through the luggage\u2019s owner, Julia Clarmeont, which would deflect any suspicion on himself. However, the bomb detonates before they are able to follow through with it. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Throughout the entire story, the protagonist tries to avoid any interaction with the police because he is afraid that they will either consider him the bomber or force him to reveal his ability, thus, changing his life for the worse. Even when Julia and the protagonist were ready to file a theft report, he quickly left after hearing the explosion. Possibly, he thought that he would be under suspicion and wasn\u2019t sure that the police would believe the real story even after he revealed his secret. ",
        "Summary_3": "The protagonist and the authority figures share a fairly neutral relationship. On the plane, he first speaks to the stewardess by rejecting her food offer. The stewardess also later brings him a cup of coffee and takes the crushed cup away. At the baggage claim, the attendant continues to stare at the protagonist as he stares back. He is bored of his job and confused why the protagonist would ask about bags that are not claimed. He wants to tell the airport policeman that there is a bomb in one of the luggage, but he does not because he sees the clerk begin to move the unclaimed piece of luggage inside. The policeman remains unaware of the bomb. Later, when he and Julia speak to the policeman about a stolen bag, the policeman is sympathetic. As the bomb goes off, the policeman tells them that he cannot make them report the stolen bags after the two of them do not want their pieces of luggage anymore. ",
        "Summary_4": "The protagonist holds the worry about the explosion of the bomb, but he cannot tell the airport authority about it because he cannot explain how he knows it. Meanwhile, the airport authority works as they usually do without knowing the bomb's existence. They can see the protagonist constantly hovering around the place and looking worrisome and anxious. Still, the only thought they have is probably to regard the protagonist as a strange person that needs help. When the protagonist\u2019s baggage is stolen, the policeman comes and asks if he needs help. After hearing the explosive sound, the protagonist tells the policeman he does not want to report the case. The policeman allows him to do so."

        "Article": " \n  The Sense of Wonder\n  \n \n  By MILTON LESSER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by HARRY ROSENBAUM\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  When nobody aboard ship remembers where it's\n   \n  going, how can they tell when it has arrived?\n  \n \n \n  Every day for a week now, Rikud had come to the viewport to watch\nthe great changeless sweep of space. He could not quite explain the\nfeelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since\nthe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,\nfrom the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his\nlife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had\ngrown.\n  \n \n  If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This\ndisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had\nrealized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside\nhim.\n  \n \n  Today, space looked somehow different. The stars\u2014it was a meaningless\nconcept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright\npinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport\u2014were not\napparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead,\nthere was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart\nby itself in the middle of the viewport.\n  \n \n  If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was\nodd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was\u2014it was\u2014what\nwas it?\n  \n \n  Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and\ngreeted gray-haired old Chuls.\n  \n \n  \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you'll be ready to sire\nchildren. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the\nhealth-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it;\nhe just didn't, without comprehending.\n  \n \n  Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the\ntime he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select\nas his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud\nignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling\nhe could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man\nhad? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always\nembroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a\nheadache?\n  \n \n  Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here\nand knew it was your time, too....\"\n  \n \n  His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not\nexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had\ndeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go with you,\" Rikud told him.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "The story starts off with the main character, Rikud, watching space from a viewport that is located on what seems to be a spaceship. Rikud is part of a group of men that live on the spaceship under a strict set of unspoken rules. Rikud then connects with other characters named Chuls and Crifer while getting a bath of health-rays, an example of the high technology in the ship. After the stars in the viewport start changing, Rikud doubts the way of living that the men have taken. He starts to doubt the fact that they have a set span of years, and that they have to live separately from the women (even though he doesn't know what women are). When the view of the viewport changes to \u201cgardens\u201d, Rikud begins to question more and more, and ends up finding the machine room for the ship, as well as a control center that has another viewport. Unsuccessfully convincing the others to go outside with him, Rikud becomes enraged and breaks the machine room of the ship. After realizing that Rikud has messed up the buzzers that control the actions of the people, they begin to hurt Rikud and chase him through the ship. Rikud ends up opening the door that leads outside from the control room, and they discover a new world where they can live freely with the women. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Rikud has come to watch the great changeless sweep of space for a week. The steady whining of the world that he has heard for all twenty-five years of his life have grown. Space looks different to him today because the stars are not as bright, and there is more darkness except for one very bright star that has set itself apart. Old Chuls approaches him and chides him for staring at stars when he is almost ready to foster children in five years. Rikud is nervous because no other man has these thoughts about who the Calculator will select as their mate. Chuls says that it is time for his bath in the health-rays, and Rikud goes with him. When they get to the health-ray area, Rikud feels the urge to see the stars again. The machine tells him fifteen minutes under the tub. Crifer, who is in the tube on his left, brings satisfaction to Rikud through his lame foot because it is proof that the world is not perfect. Crifer tells Rikud that he has been reading about astronomy lately in the library and stars. When Rikud tells him that the stars are changing, Crifer offers that variability may contribute. He later goes to see the stars again, observing how they make his eyes hurt and are paler than before. Rikud then sees a new shape appear in the form of a big sphere. He tries to get Chuls to see it too when the old man tells him it is time to eat, but Chuls sees and hears nothing. After a while, Rikud becomes fascinated with the gardens in the viewport. The view does not change for an entire week, and Crifer also agrees that the view looks like a garden. When he brings the conversation back to the stars appearing and disappearing, Crifer once again brings up variable. Rikud believes he has a bigger purpose in life; he decides to investigate the door at the back of the library while Crifer reads another book on astronomy. He sees another door that explains how this ship is a self-sustaining world, but Rikud cannot understand the words. He then has a traumatizing experience about going out to the garden because it is completely foreign to him. Three or four days later, Rikud feels comfortable enough to tell Crifer about what happened. He tries to convince Chuls too and grabs his blouse. Others in the crowd copy Rikud grabbing Chul\u2019s blouse, but a buzzer goes off and it is time for them to retire. Rikud then decides to break the buzzer, and everybody hates him. Nobody wants to go out with him, and they all decide to begin attacking him for breaking the buzzer. He tries to escape them, and all of them end up going into the garden. The story cuts to them realizing how beautiful it is outside, and the women begin to appear from the ship as well. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows Rikud who lives aboard a ship that is self-sustaining and separated by men and women. He first encounters a unique feeling when he looks through the viewport and notices that the space around him has changed. The stars in particular, previously speckled and scattered, have now been replaced by a singular bright star. \n\nWhile undergoing his bath in the health rays, Rikud laments his life on the ship. Noting the lack of authority - the closest being the automated buzzer - he ponders the perfectness of life around him and realizes he is assured by Crifer\u2019s limp because it demonstrated that not everything was perfect. When talking to him, Crifer reveals that he has begun reading again in lieu of the normal evening activity of chatting to other ship passengers. In return, Rikud reveals that the stars in the viewport are changing and Crifer suggests that it may be due to variability - a concept newly introduced in his book on astronomy. While Rikud and Crifer contemplate the meaning of variability and the connection between the concepts, Chuls interrupts by denouncing variability as a contradictory term. Once the buzzer sounds again, they all continue with their daily routine. \n\nAs Rikud looks again at the star, he finds that the landscape has changed to reveal a sphere with brown and green, just like the garden aboard the ship. Despite the hesitant acknowledgment and adamant denial from Crifer and Chuls respectively, they are unable to explain why the garden is in the viewpoint. Continuing with his exploration, Rikud enters through a set of doors no man has gone through. As he enters through each door, he receives warnings from the buzzer and encounters stranger noises. By the time he attempts to reach the third, Rikud is overwhelmed with a sense of fear and runs back. In explaining his discovery, Rikud begins to hold Chul\u2019s blouse and sets off a chain of reactions with the other men as they begin to mimic his unfamiliar but exciting activity. However, once the buzzer sounds again, the men forget their behavior. Frustrated with the buzzing, Rikud finds a metal rod and smashes all the machinery on board - destroying the buzzer and the machines that provided the ship with light, food, and water. Disrupted by their routine and lifeline to the buzzer, Crifer and the other men begin to riot against Rikud, chasing and beating him. In running away from them, Rikud finds himself at the third door and while uncertain about the potential of life beyond the door, he chooses to open it to reveal the garden and the blue-white globe. \n\nThrough the door reveals fresh air, plants, and running water. Rikud and the others step out and bask in this strange but comforting new landscape, and as the women on the ship stepped off as well, Rikud noted a sense of contentedness in a world away from the buzzer and the machines.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story talks about a distant future where people left Earth long ago and now are living on a spaceship that is traveling through space. The ship is divided into two parts: male and female. People of two different sexes meet when they turn 30 after the so-called calculator defines their future partner.  Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity. They do not understand the concepts of change, world, space, authority, just living with the same schedule. They do not understand sickness since now they can take a bath in the health rays that provide them with immunity. \n\nRikud is a 25-year-old inhabitant who enjoys looking at the viewport that shows the changing stars. Sometimes he chats with Chuls, a 90-year-old fellow inhabitant of the ship, who doesn't show any traits of nonconformity and is satisfied with his regulated schedule. We meet him at the very beginning when he joins Rikud who stands near the viewport gazing at the stars. Together they go to the health rays\u2019 room. While waiting for the procedure to be over, Rikud thinks about different arbitrary notions, like authority, history, human will. In the same room lies Crifer, another inhabitant of the ship. He\u2019s short and has a lame foot which reminds Rikud of the world\u2019s imperfection. Crifer says that he found an interesting book about astronomy during his visit to the reading room. Rikud says that stars may be changing and Crifer claims that the book mentioned their variability, Chuls protests but their conversation ends quickly. Later, Rikud, during his visits to the viewport,  witnesses a rapid change in the stars, their form, location, and even experiences a novel feeling of pain while looking at one of them without breaks. Amazed, Rikud stands there and asks Chuls about the differences in the viewport and in the sound of the engines, which, as Rikud noticed, had become quieter, but the old man gives an unsatisfying answer. Later, apparently after landing, Rikud sees a huge garden in the viewport and this image doesn\u2019t change for a whole week. \n\nWhile visiting the reading room with Crifer, Rikud decides to open the door that he finds there. It leads to a room where he hears a voice saying something about unauthorized visitors. The next room is full of wires, gears, and cogs. The third one has a small viewport showing the same garden from a different side. When no one believes him later, infuriated, Rikud comes back and destroys the wired room, which he suspects to be the buzzer. Now it doesn\u2019t go off and the food mechanism is not working, leaving the ship's inhabitants confused and hungry. They become angry and try to chase Rikud. The sense of danger forces Rikud to open the little viewport from the third room and finally leave the ship. Everybody goes out into the world and finally sees the garden.\n"

        "Summary_1": "The story is located in space, inside of a large spaceship. The ship has a viewport that looks outside of the ship, and is where Rikad spends most of his time. The ship also seems to have high tech, showcased in the med room. Here is where the men go to stay healthy by being showered under health rays. The ship also has a library, which is where Crifer and Rikud read about astronomy and stars, and where Rikud started to doubt more and more about their lifestyle. The ship then arrives at a planet, full of lush greenery, making Rikud more and more suspicious of the changing view. After exploring the back of the room Rikud finds a series of rooms. These rooms include both a machinery room that is full of gears and tubes as well as a control room that has a smaller viewport. The story ends in the new planet, after Rikud opened the door that led outside, knowing that they would be able to survive after he compared the new planet to the gardens that the ship had. ",

Inside of the ship, there is a health-ray bath area; people lie naked under the ray tubes. It is also impossible for people to injure themselves; for example, Rikud was cushioned by something soft when he hurled himself at the wall. There is a library too, but nobody reads anymore so it is covered in dust. There is also a dusty table and a door at the back. Outside of the viewport, a garden soon appears. It is larger than the entire world, with plants that Rikud has never seen before. Later, Rikud confronts Chuls in a room where other people gather as well.

Rikud gets back to the viewport a few times, noticing how the stars change their form and then surprisingly disappear just to be replaced by an image of a garden - this puzzles him. Later, in the reading room with Crifer, Rikud opens a mysterious doof, leading to a room with a voice that prohibits his unauthorized presence. The next room turns out to be full of wires, cogs, and gears - apparently, it\u2019s the buzzer - the sound system that controls the ship\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 daily life. The last room was a tunnel with a small viewport at the end. When no one believes Rikud, he comes back, upset and angry, and breaks the mechanism in the second room, turning off the buzzer and the food system. Hungry and violent, people chase Rikud who runs back to the small viewport door he found and opens it, leaving the craft. Now everybody was in a large garden, apparently, on some new planet their craft landed on. "

Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it\nmeant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the\nlibrary and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat\nabout and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.\n  \n \n  But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the\npeople ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it\nwas always the same.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" said Crifer. \"I found a book about the stars. They're also\ncalled astronomy, I think.\"\n  \n \n  This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one\nelbow. \"What did you find out?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, where's the book?\" Rikud would read it tomorrow.\n  \n \n  \"I left it in the library. You can find several of them under\n'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous\nterms.\"\n  \n \n  \"You know,\" Rikud said, sitting up now, \"the stars in the viewport are\nchanging.\"\n  \n \n  \"Changing?\" Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he\nquestioned what it might mean in this particular case.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the\nothers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Astronomy says some stars are variable,\" Crifer offered, but Rikud\nknew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he\ndid.\n  \n \n  Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. \"Variability,\" he told\nthem, \"is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm only saying what I read in the book,\" Crifer protested mildly.\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words without\nmeaning.\"\n  \n \n  \"People grow old,\" Rikud suggested.\n  \n \n  A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and\nChuls said, \"It's almost time for me to eat.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the two\nconcepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago,\nbut now it faded, and change and old were just two words.\n  \n \n  His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange\nfeeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the\nviewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of the\nworld, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman.\nHe had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly\nremembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed;\nthis was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings\u2014strange\nchannelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.\n  \n \n  He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the\nstars again.\n  \n<doc-sep>For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept\nit as fact. There\u2014through the viewport and in it\u2014was a garden. A\ngarden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had\nnever seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the\nworld's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless,\nit was a garden.\n  \n \n  He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, \"It is the viewport.\"\n  \n \n  Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. \"It looks like the garden,\"\nhe admitted to Rikud. \"But why should the garden be in the viewport?\"\n  \n \n  Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could\nnot tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the\nviewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking\u2014the\nword seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless\nit were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere\nwas the garden and the world had arrived.\n  \n \n  \"It is an old picture of the garden,\" Chuls suggested, \"and the plants\nare different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then they've changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, merely different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what about the viewport?\n   \n   It\n   \n  changed.

He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Variability is a big part of the story. The inhabitants of the ship have always lived the same routine, the same life, and when things start to change they don\u2019t know how to react. First, when the view of the ship starts to change, Rikud doesn\u2019t understand what it means, and begins to think about the meaning of change. These thoughts are enhanced when Crifer told him that he had been reading Astronomy, and that stars are variable. When the ship lands on the new planet, and Rikud begins to explore, he starts to think about the variability of doors, and the meaning of going through doors and how it relates to the viewport. In the end, the change from having the buzzers to not knowing how to act is what sparks the violence of the men towards Rikud. This is due to the fact that he changed their routine, and having never experienced it, they don\u2019t know how to react to change. ",
        "Summary_2": "Variability signifies the change to the lifestyle on the self-sustaining ship. When Crifer brings up the variability of the stars, Chuls is quick to refute the idea and says that nothing is variable. In the story, variability exists when Rikuld begins to notice the sweep of space and the stars. While the others are perfectly content with their lives and believe that they will not leave the ship, Rikuld differentiates from the rest. He wants to explore the greater world and does not believe that their only function is to live on the ship, conceive children, and eventually grow to die. The variability that is he believes he has a greater purpose, and this differentiates him from the rest. It also motivates him to see the world that the ship has landed in once the landscape does not change for a week. ",
        "Summary_3": "The concept of variability is significant because it exists in contrast to the world that is presented in the story. The ship, the routine, and the characters that follow the routine are not variable. Everything is premeditated and controlled, with no room for change. However, the changing landscape outside the viewport and Crifer\u2019s base understanding of the astronomy book introduces this idea of variability, which Rikud in particular latches onto as the potential answer for the dissonance he is experiencing. The stars, the sphere, and the garden that they see - could it be due to variability? \n\nAs the story progresses, Rikud begins to better understand the meaning of variability and finds that many concepts around him are in fact variable, like Crifer\u2019s feelings towards him. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story describes the life of people of the future: they live on a big spaceship with a regulated daily schedule consisting of health ray procedures, eating, and limited free time. No one questions the limits of their world, so no one understands the phenomenon of change as it has never occurred in their lives on the craft. Rikud, a young inhabitant of the ship, analyzes the changing views of the stars and tries to explain them. His friend, Crifer, tells him about the stars\u2019 feature called variability that he read about in an old astronomy book. They both do not really understand this concept, neither don\u2019t they understand change, but Rikud needs to rationalize why stars become brighter and change form. His attempts are also hindered by Chuls, an old man who actively claims that both change and variability are useless terms with no real meaning. When the views change again, and the image of a garden replaces the stars, Rikud is even more puzzled. Crifer mentions the variability of stars again, explaining their disappearance, and Rikud starts thinking about the concept of change. He uses the word variable to label everything that is not functioning normally or is unknown to him, including doors, the rooms he finds near the reading room, and people. The term both serves as a stepping stone to an understanding of changes and as an independent notion that explains the differences in behavior, environment, etc. After all, seeking the explanation of change and variability, Rikud opens the viewport-door and enables the others to step outside and see the garden that their craft landed in.

        "Summary_1": "At the beginning of the story, the relationship between Rikud and Chuls seemed like a mentor-mentee or like a father-son relationship. Rikud was a young forward-thinker, and Chuls was an older man who had already lived a lot and tried to guide Rikud on how he should live. As the story progresses more, Rikud seems to stray from Chuls\u2019 guidance and tries to figure out what to think on his own. When Rikud tries to explain his reasoning, Chuls doesn\u2019t understand because he has lived so much time inside of the ship and its routine that he can\u2019t seem to doubt it. This led to Rikud getting mildly violent at Chuls because he couldn\u2019t understand why Chuls didn\u2019t believe him. ",

Chuls is content with how he lives, but he does care for Rikud when he tells him to eat. Rikud, on the other hand, does not like that Chuls is content with how he lives his life. He is angry that Chuls is so dismissive of his ideas and thinks that all the other man cares about is eating. When Rikud asks Chuls to come to see the garden, he refuses and thinks about eating again. Rikud is furious and grabs him by the shirt; everybody else copies this action. Although Chuls is not as angry as Crifer when Rikud breaks the machine, he is sad because he does not have a purpose of living by the buzzer\u2019s announcement. ",
        "Summary_3": "The relationship between Rikud and Chuls is antagonistic. Rikud is presented as the wild card who sees the changing star, who begins to question the routine aboard the ship and who ultimately incites new and unfamiliar behaviors and feelings amongst the other men on the ship. On the other hand, Chuls is an old man who follows the rule without question and content with the life he lives. \n\nFor example, when Rikud and Crifer begin to discuss the word \u201cvariability\u201d and the potential of the changing stars being variable, Chuls quickly shuts down this idea by adamantly declaring that the word itself is a contradiction - and that they should go eat. When looking at the changed landscape of the star through the viewport, Rikud and Crifer begin to question why the garden is in the viewport, but Chuls simply says that it is the viewport. Therein lies the tension between these two characters, with Rikud constantly questioning and probing and Chuls remaining steadfast in his routine and knowledge of the world. \n",

He is not seeking answers and has no urge to understand the world or see anything beyond the walls of the spaceship. When Rikud notices the changes in the viewport he tries to find an explanation and define the term \u2018change\u2019. Bur Chuls is consciously ignoring anything that reminds him of change, he can see the same view, though the stars changed their size and location, hear the same engine sound, though in reality, it became quieter.

Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to\nturn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed\nto control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white\nglobe\u2014if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There\nwas that word change again. Didn't it have something to do with age?\nRikud couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's\nbook on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was\nvariable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age.\n  \n \n  Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer,\nand he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that\nhe couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his\neyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them.\nBut the new view persisted.\n  \n \n  Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone,\ntoo, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge\nthat it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and\nround, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud\nhad no name.\n  \n \n  A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section\nof it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the\nviewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the\nmiddle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green,\nand on the other, blue.\n  \n \n  Startled, Rikud leaped back.

When he looks through the viewport again, he sees that the bright central star has become a blue-tinged globe of light. This is extremely significant because what Rikud is observing is actually the ship\u2019s landing on a new planet. This motivates him to investigate further, and he finds that the scenery has not changed for a week after a garden begins to enter the viewport\u2019s field of vision. The viewport also serves as a reason for Rikud to break the ship\u2019s buzzer announcement system; this stops everybody from living their pre-programmed way of life and to leave the ship for the more mysterious world outside. Without the viewport, Rikud would have never noticed the changes in space and as they eventually land on the planet. ",
        "Summary_3": "The viewport in this story is the only portal in which characters in this story are able to look beyond their perfect, constructed world aboard the ship. It is the only window into what exists outside of the ship, and throughout the story, we can see that it is where change and a variability in landscape is seen. \n\nIt is significant because what Rikud sees through the viewport is what begins to create dissonance in his relationship with the world around him. It is only when he begins to notice the change in the stars, the appearance of a sphere with blue and green, and a bright light that he further questions why the men live on the ship and not outside. Additionally, it is significant because the viewport is one-dimensional in that all information is one-way. Whatever Rikud and the other men see through the viewport can only be explained by them, and so they have no way of knowing if it is true or not. As seen in the story, many times the other men are reluctant to even wonder what it is or simply shrug and move on. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story talks about our distant future. Humans left Earth long ago and now live on a spaceship that has been traveling through space for centuries. Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity: eating, sleeping, free time. They do not understand the concepts of change, space, because their life is limited to the rooms of the ship. The main character, Rikud, is a young man who enjoys looking at the viewport - it allows him to see the stars surrounding the ship and the cosmic blackness. He spends some time every day contemplating the view and notices when the stars change in size and location, disappearing from the view. This observation makes him think about variability and change, what these terms mean. When sometime later Rikud sees an unchanging image of a garden instead of cosmos in the viewport, he starts questioning the space he\u2019s so long lived in. His attempt to rationalize this makes him more curious, and soon he finds another viewport that also looks like a door to the outer world. A different angle of view surprises him since he has always thought that there\u2019s only one possible viewpoint on this ship. After days of chaotic thoughts and revelations, after breaking the buzzer and causing the inhabitants\u2019 anger, Rikud finally opens the small viewport and sets foot in the garden, allowing everyone else to leave the ship, too.
