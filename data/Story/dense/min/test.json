        "Summary_1": "Noork is in a tree on a moon named Sekk, watching a woman walk through the jungle.  When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle.",
        "Summary_2": "Noork, a man from Earth who doesn\u2019t remember who he is, lives in the jungle on a second moon. He knows he was brought there by what he remembers as a huge bird and that he was taken in by a man named Gurn and the Vasad people of the jungle. He meets a woman named Sarna with whom he shares a mutual attraction, and it turns out that she is Gurn\u2019s sister. Shortly after they discover this, they are attacked. Sarna vanishes and Noork hides, eventually discovering that the \u201cMisty Ones\u201d who attacked them, thought to be demons, look similar to him and can be \u201cskinned\u201d; this is important because their skins or coverings allow the wearer to be nearly invisible like them. \n\nNoork passes a message along via another Vasad to tell Gurn what he has learned about the Misty Ones, and to say that Noork has gone to rescue Sarna. He sneaks into the walled temple where the slaves are being kept, and enlists the help of another slave, Rold, to help them get out if he can get Sarna. Noork goes down to the cavern and, after fighting a priest to the death, rescues Sarna. They escape with Rold, only to be captured by more Misty Ones, one of whom turns out to be a Nazi from Noork\u2019s previous life. \n\nThough Noork can\u2019t remember him (but knows he dislikes him), Doctor Von Mark remembers him. Noork\u2019s name was Stephen Dietrich, and he was an American flier who had chased down one of the last nazi criminals: Doctor Von Mark. Von Mark had then flown one of his shuttles to Sekk and landed successfully, while Stephen had pursued him in another of his shuttles and crashed on Sekk, resulting in his amnesia. \u201cNoork\u201d was the name given to him by the Vasad based on the only sounds he could make: \u201cNew York\u201d. \n\nDoctor Von Mark asks if Noork knows the secret to the invisibility of the Misty One\u2019s skins, since this would allow him to return to Earth and take it over for the Fatherland. When he realizes that Noork knows nothing, he moves to kill him but is shot by an arrow just in time. Gurn has rallied warriors based on Noork\u2019s message. Noork now knows his real name and that he got where he is by hunting down an evil man. He is now happy to live safely in the jungle with Gurn and Sarna, and she says she is happy, too. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Noork is a man from Earth whose real name is Stephen Dietrich; he was pursuing the Nazi Dr. Karl Von Mark, the last of the Axis criminals at large. Dietrich followed Von Mark to Africa where Von Mark took off in a spaceship, and Dietrich followed. Both landed on Sekk, a second moon past Luna, but Dietrich\u2019s landing was so rough that he lost his memory. When the locals found him, he said, \u201cNew York,\u201d which they didn\u2019t understand and named him Noork. Noork lives among the Vasads and learns their language. \n\nNoork and Tholon Sarna meet in the jungle and become friends. One day as they are talking, Noork hears feet scuffing, and Tholon disappears. Noork climbs a tree to find out where the Misty Ones are (They are invisible.). He detects movement and throws overripe fruit, which stains the cloaks of the Misty Ones. Noork shoots arrows toward the creatures and kills one. He takes that one\u2019s robe, which is what makes the Misty Ones invisible. \n\nNoork tells one of his colleagues to take the message to Gurn, their leader and Tholon\u2019s brother, that the Misty Ones are flesh and blood, not demons as they believe. He tells Ud that he is going to the island of the Misty Ones to save Tholon. He reaches the wall surrounding the Misty Ones\u2019 village and overhears two slaves talking before they separate. Noork approaches the slave in the field, Rold, and asks for his help in exchange for helping Rold escape. Rold explains that the large skull is the god Uzdon, and the priests make sacrifices by taking the heart out of a living slave girl. He also tells Noork that the slave girls are held in a pit beneath the skull guarded by Misty Ones.\n\nNoork moves among the Misty Ones in anonymity since he is wearing one of their robes. He enters the skull and kills the guards who are in charge of the slave girls. Just as he is about to release Tholon, a priest catches him, and they fight until Noork kills him, too. Noork takes more robes and the priest\u2019s face shield and leaves with Tholon and Rold. The face shield enables him to see the Misty Ones who are invisible to everyone else, so he can see when they are waiting to trap them. They capture the escape party, and one of the Misty Ones reveals that he is Dr. Von Mark after recognizing Dietrich. Von Mark reveals his plans to use the cloaks of invisibility to conquer Earth and make Germany invincible. Von Mark prepares to shoot Dietrich but is shot by an arrow first. Misty Ones close in on the group and lower their hoods, revealing Tholon\u2019s brother Gurn and his men. Noork now remembers who he is and says he will live in peace with Gurn and his sister.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Noork searches for the bird that dropped him on a cliff (as well as another bird) when he is discovered by the Vasads. He repeated the word \"New York\", and so the Vasads call him Noork. From his perch, he now watches a girl\u2014Tholon Sarna--moving along a trail below. She is the sister of Gurn, the Vasad leader. Gurn has been exiled from their home city of Grath because he doesn't believe in the enslavement of the Zuran, and Tholon Sarna has recently evaded capture by her enemies, the men of Konto. The Misty Ones--slavers dwellling at the Temple of the Skull and feared deeply by the Vasads--follow her. As Tholon Sarna and Noork walk, she is captured by a Misty One made invisible by a special robe. A Misty One clubs Noork, injuring his arm. Thanks to their blurry outlines, Noork realizes the Misty Ones are not entirely invisible, and he uses his legs to pelt them with fruit. Upon seeing their true form--closer to his own human shape--Noork loses his fear of them and begins attacking them with arrows. He takes the invisibility robe of a fallen Misty One and uses it to disguise himself as he makes his way to the Temple of the Skull. Along the way, he reunites with his friend Ud, a jungle-dwelling beast-man. He sends Ud to inform Gurn of the Misty Ones' newfound weakness. We then learn that Noork's real name is Stephen Dietrich, and he had been hunting Dr. Karl Von Mark, a criminal scientist attempting to revivify the Nazi power structure. Von Mark manages to evade Dietrich by landing on Sekk, and Dietrich crashes and succumbs to amnesia. The bird that had carried him to the cliff was his own plane, and the bird he had been seeking was Von Mark's. Now, Noork descends upon a slave named Rold near the Temple of the Skull. He enlists Rold to help him free Tholon Sarna. Rold informs Noork of the High Priest's plan to choose a sacrifice to their god, Uzdon, from the female slaves caged in a pit beneath the Skull. Noork promises a robe to Rold if his plan to rescue Tholon Sarna succeeds. In disguise, Noork approaches the Skull, heavily guarded by Misty Ones, and makes his way toward the pit. Along the way, he defeats guards and pockets two robes. Before freeing Tholon Sarna, Noork battles the High Priest, kills him, and they make their escape. Soon after, they are again trapped by a group of Misty Ones--this time led by none other than Dr. Karl Von Mark himself. Von Mark tells Noork of his desire to use the secret of invisibility to make Germany all-powerful, and he pulls out a gun to kill him. Suddenly, Gurn emerges with the Vasads, and they kill Von Mark with arrows. Noork recalls his true identify as Captain Dietrich and looks forward to a life of peace amongst the Vasads with Tholon Sarna."

        "Summary_1": "The story begins in thick jungle on Sekk, which we are told is a \"second moon\" which retains a \"breathable atmosphere\" around a lake surrounded by eleven jungled valleys.  In this way, it is implied that Sekk is a second moon of Earth.\n\nIn the jungle, we meet Noork and a young woman named Sarna.  They begin traveling together through the jungle, but soon Sarna disappears and Noork is attacked.  This is our first encounter with the Misty Ones, who blend in with the jungle foliage.  Noork defeats the Misty Ones and continues toward the lake and island where they make their home.\n\nNoork briefly encounters his friend Ud near the marshy lowlands that lie between the jungled valleys on Sekk and the central Lake of Uzdon, but this area is not described.  When Noork reaches the central island in the lake, we encounter a non-jungle landscape for the first time.  Noork finds himself in a cultivated field, and sees the shape of a huge white skull about half a mile away.  After speaking with an enslaved man and learning where Sarna is being held, Noork continues toward the skull.\n\nThe skull is a dome of white stone, with black stone for eye-sockets and nose-holes.  The interior contains a raised altar made of precious metals--gold, silver, and brass--and precious stones, as well as stone images of the two gods the Misty Ones worship.  Below the altar is the caged area where the young women are held; Noork detects the entrance to this area by its foul odor.  The room where the young women are kept is dimly lit by only two torches, very damp with pools of dirty water all around, and holds at least twenty young women.  They have nothing to sit on but rotten grass mats.  In contrast to the enslaved men who are out in the cultivated fields and open air, the young women are in a desperate situation indeed.  They can only sit in their foul, rotting prison and wait to be sacrificed.",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place sometime after World War II on a second moon that is obscured by the moon we know and is known as Sekk. The moon Sekk has a diameter of less than five-hundred miles and a thirty-two-hour revolution, and it has a breathable atmosphere that sustains life. Life on Sekk is concentrated within a star-shaped cavity that features a lake and eleven valleys branching out from it, all of which contain jungles. The action of the story happens in the jungle areas, the lake, a walled temple, and the cavern prison beneath it. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set on Sekk, the second moon, beyond Luna and blocked from Earth\u2019s view by Luna. Sekk is less than 500 miles in diameter and has a revolution period of 32 hours. It has a breathable atmosphere and features a star-shaped center surrounded by twelve valleys thick with jungle growth. Some trees are over forty feet tall; Noork uses these trees to surveil the area around him. Several groups live on Sekk in different villages, and there are dangerous wild animals called spotted narls. There is a mysterious group of beings, believed to be demons, called the Misty Ones because they are invisible. They live on an island in the middle of a lake and have a huge skull that represents their god, Uzdon. Female slaves are held captive in a pit beneath the skull. The story takes place after World War II, when the Allies were searching for Nazi officers to stand trial for their war crimes. Dr. Karl Von Mark is one of the Nazi officials, and he makes his way to Africa, pursued by the American Stephen Dietrich. They both fly into space and land on Sekk where Von Mark works on his scheme to return and take over the Earth, and Dietrich loses his memory and becomes known as Noork.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on a small moon called Sekk, five hundred miles wide with a thirty-two-hour day. The atmosphere on Sekk supports life, which exists in rich abundance within a star-like depression in its earth. Deep in this depression is a lake surrounded by twelve vast, green valleys and jungles. The jungles are dense and covered with massive trees that look like giants. Many of these trees have sticky fruits that Noork later uses to help him see the Misty Ones.  Noork paddles across the lake in order to reach the island of Manak, which is home to the Temple of Skull where the Misty Ones make their sacrifices to the gods Uzdon and Lornu. The Temple is comprised mostly of stone, and the sacrificial altar is made of brass, gold, and silver. After navigating through the Temple to find Tholon Sarna, he eventually ends up in \u201cthe pit\u201d\u2014a cavern dimly lit with torches and peppered with dark standing water. After their escape from the Temple, they are once again stopped by Misty Ones in a grassy inlet back on the mainland. This is where Dr. Von Mark reveals Noork\u2019s true identity to him and is killed by Gurn and the Vasads."

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "We first hear Gurn's name mentioned by Noork in his initial meeting with Sarna.  He tells her that he has been living with the wild Vasads of the jungle with Gurn, his friend and their chief.  Noork goes on to say that Gurn is an exile from the walled city of Grath and asks Sarna if she knows why this is.  Sarna says that her brother says they should no longer enslave Zurans they capture from other valleys.  In this way, their relationships with Gurn build a bridge between them, allowing them to consider a relationship with one another.\n\nGurn is next mentioned when Noork encounters his friend Ud near the central lake of Sekk, the moon they are on.  Noork asks Ud to go to their mutual friend Gurn and pass on a message.  Noork asks Ud to tell Gurn that the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  When Ud wonders why anyone would want to do such a thing, Noork tells him that Noork is trying to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\", as he describes Gurn's sister Sarna.\n\nGurn then arrives as something between a hero and a deus ex machina at the very end of the story.  Noork, Sarna, and Rold, an enslaved man who helped Noork free Sarna, are about to be murdered by Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones, when Gurn and his allies arrive and shoot the enemy full of arrows, saving all their lives.  Gurn reveals that he received Ud's messages and they were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake and stealing their robes so they could come to Noork's rescue.  Without Gurn, Noork and Sarna would never have traveled together in the first place, nor would they have been rescued at the end.",
        "Summary_2": "Gurn is described as a renegade and the leader of the Vasad, a hairy people living in the jungle on Sekk. He is tall, strong, golden-skinned, and has proven to be a friend to Noork. He wears bracelets connected by human hair. He has been exiled from the city of Grath because he spoke out against keeping the captured people from other valleys as slaves. He is Sarna\u2019s brother, and she seems to trust Noork more when he mentions Gurn. After he and Sarna are attacked, Noork passes a message to another Vasad, Ud, to tell Gurn that the \u201cmisty people\u201d they fear can be killed and their skins used to conceal them, and that he\u2019s going to save Sarna.

He is tall and strong, wears a bracelet made of gold discs linked together with human hair, and talks with his own shadow when he thinks. Gurn was exiled from the city of Grath, whose leaders called him a traitor for voicing his opinion that they should not make their captured Zurans slaves. When Noork leaves to rescue Tholon from the Misty Ones, he sends word to Gurn via Ud that the Misty Ones are not demons but flesh and bone beings who can be trapped and skinned and that he is going to rescue Gurn\u2019s sister from the Misty Ones. At the end of the story, when Von Mark and his men have captured Noork, Tholon, and Rold, Gurn and his men arrive and pelt the Waris with arrows to rescue Noork and the others.

Gurn discovers Noork when he first lands on Sekk and reminds him that he has not always lived in the valleys of the moon. As leader of the Vasads, Gurn has been exiled from his home city of Grath for speaking out against the enslavement of the people of Zura. Gurn and the Vasads fear the Misty Ones that make sacrifices to Uzdon at the Temple of the Skull, believing they are gods or demons. When Noork discovers the Misty Ones can be shed of their invisibility, he sends his friend Ud to inform Gurn. Upon hearing this news, Gurn brings the Vasads to rescue his sister, Tholon Sarna, and they arrive just in time to prevent Dr. Von Mark from killing Noork. Instead, Gurn kills Dr. Von Mark by shooting him with arrows, and Noork decides to live in peace with him, the Vasads, and Tholon Sarna."

        "Summary_1": "Enslavement and freedom as themes run throughout the story.  When Noork and Sarna first meet each other in the opening scene, one of the ways they decide to trust one another is because of their mutual relationships with Gurn, a third character.  Gurn has been exiled from the city of Grath because he says that his people should no longer enslave the captured Zurans from other valleys of Sekk.  In the next scene, we learn that Sarna, Gurn's sister, was kidnapped by one group of slavers, escaped them with four others, and only narrowly escaped capture by a second group of slavers, the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull, who captured the other four of her group.  Noork tells her that one day he will visit the island of Misty Ones who took her friends.  At this time, he realizes that Sarna has disappeared, and he is attacked by the Misty Ones, though he is able to fight them off.\n\nDuring Noork's travels to the island of the Misty Ones, we learn his backstory: he is American pilot Stephen Dietrich, and he arrived on the moon of Sekk by following Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Nazi criminals at large.  Dietrich's ship had crashed on Sekk, robbing him of his memory.  In the conflict between the Allies and Nazis, we again see the conflict between enslavement and freedom:  the Nazis forced those they considered racially \"impure\" into prison camps where they were either murdered outright or forced to engage in labor under inhumane conditions until they died; the Allied forces were a hope of freedom for these imprisoned, enslaved people.\n\nNoork spies on enslaved men in the fields outside the temple of the Misty Ones and hears them gossiping about Sarna.  The older man suggests that their life is not so bad, but the younger man protests and states that one day he plans to escape.  Noork approaches the younger man to find out where Sarna is being held and promises to take him along when he and Sarna escape.  Noork then fights off multiple guards and a priest in order to free Sarna from the pit where she is held, which is dank and full of rotting grass mats and little light.\n\nWhile the story touches on themes of enslavement and freedom, it does not engage with them fully.  The dungeon where the enslaved young women is held is described in foul terms, but Noork does not seem to free all the young women from their prison.  That may happen as a result of Gurn's final attack on Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones, but Noork escapes only with Sarna and Rold.  Rold is unhappy with being enslaved, not because he is being harmed or others are, but because he is not free to mate with attractive young women like Sarna.  While the story should not need to spell out every reason why enslavement is wrong, it takes a very superficial approach to a deeply painful issue.",
        "Summary_2": "Enslavement is a major theme throughout the story. Gurn has been exiled for speaking out against the slavery that his people have inflicted on others, which is how he a Noork find one another. Noork\u2019s travels during the action of the story are undertaken in an effort to save Sarna, who has now been enslaved twice. The person he enlists to help him, Rold, is also a slave. When Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones ambush Noork and the doctor recognizes him as Stephen Dietrich, he mentions that the trapper has now become the trapped. A moment later, Gurn and the other warriors free Noork from the doctor\u2019s enslavement. Most of the story involves various people being enslaved or feeling a certain way about enslavement, and the element of Nazism in the story also lends it a broader theme of the enslavement that that regime inflicted and tried to inflict, and the continued possession of the Earth that Von Mark is working toward. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Enslavement seems to be the preferred way to deal with enemies on Sekk, and when Gurn speaks out against enslaving their Zuran captives, the city rulers label him a traitor and exile him from the city. His sister, Tholon, was captured by slavers but managed to escape with four others. However, when they passed near the Lake of Uzdon, the Misty Ones captured her four fellow escapees. And while Tholon is telling her story to Noork, she is kidnapped by the Misty Ones and spirited away to their city of Uzdon. The Misty Ones offer beautiful slave girls chosen by their priests as sacrifices to their god Uzdon, binding them to the altar and removing their hearts while still alive. The Misty Ones also enslave others to be workers. Slaves work in their cultivated fields and gardens, and in the skull, slaves are chained together with heavy chains. ",
        "Summary_4": "Enslavement is an important topic in the story as many of the Zuran peoples are enslaved by various groups. The men of Kanto are enemies of the Vasads and the people of Grath, but the city of Grath also enslaves people. When Gurn speaks out against the practice, he is exiled from Grath and becomes transient with his group of Vasads. When Noork first meets Tholon Sarna, she has fled her initial enslavement, narrowly avoided enslavement by the men of Kanto, and is then captured by the Misty Ones, who also have slaves working on the island of Manak. Noork frees Rold from his enslavement, and enlists his help to prevent Tholon Sarna from becoming a human sacrifice to Uzdon. When the Vasads defeat the Misty Ones and Dr. Von Mark, they are free to live in their own society without the constraints of slavery."

He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Misty Ones are a group of highly feared beings, thought to be supernatural in some way at the beginning of the story because of their ability to remain unseen.  Noork, however, is able to catch a glimpse of the bottom of one of their feet from his vantage point high in a tree and begins to pelt the area where he believes they are with fruit.  After this, he can see their outlines and that they are wearing robes with hoods, and he ceases to be afraid and attacks with arrows, killing one of the Misty Ones.  He disrobes this man, who is described as heavily scarred on his face, having a low forehead, with more hair on his body and less golden skin than other men of Zuran.  Once Noork is sure that the Misty Ones are not supernatural, he decides to pursue them in an attempt to rescue Sarna, sister of his friend Gurn, who has been kidnapped by them.\n\nNoork spreads the word to his friend Ud that the Misty Ones are not demons and can be trapped and skinned and lets Ud know of his rescue mission for Sarna.  He also tells Rold, an enslaved man on the island of the Misty Ones and the priests of Uzdon (the god who demands sacrifice of young women).  Rold decides he will help Noork with his rescue mission in exchange for Noork's promise to rescue him as well--realizing that he is imprisoned by men and not demons has allowed him to dream that he can kill his captors and be free.\n\nWhen Noork fights a priest of Uzdon in order to free Sarna, he learns that the priests not only have the robes of concealment the Misty Ones have, they also have transparent masks that allow them to see through that concealment.  It allows him to anticipate their ambush at the end of the story, though not quite soon enough to stop it.  Gurn, though, has received his message and acted on it.  He has been capturing and \"skinning\" Misty Ones who have crossed the lake and he and his warriors ambush the Misty Ones and priests in return, freeing Noork and his friends.  With the realization that the Misty Ones are men with special cloaks rather than demons with supernatural powers, their mystique evaporates and everyone they have terrorized is willing to attack them.  Characters unwilling to battle demons are unafraid to attack men.",
        "Summary_2": "The Misty Ones are significant for several reasons. They are creatures that come from the island in the lake of Uzdon, and they look like mist and are therefore nearly invisible to most (other than the priests). They are thought to be demons and perhaps invincible, but Noork discovers otherwise when he gets close enough to see that they look like him. He passes a message along to Gurn that they can be trapped and skinned. Noork\u2019s discovery of this allows him to rescue Sarna and allows Gurn and the other warriors to rescue them from Doctor Von Mark. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Misty Ones are mysterious beings who are invisible and cause problems for others. With so little is known about them other than their devious acts, they are considered demons. They live on an island in the Lake of Uzdon and have a giant skull known as the Temple of the Skull that represents their god, Uzdon, to whom they over living female sacrifices. The Misty Ones wear cloaks that make them invisible, and until Noork shoots and kills one with an arrow, no one knows that they are flesh and bone beings underneath their robes. Noork discovers they look very much like he does but with a low, sloping forehead and more body hair. When the Misty Ones kidnap Tholon, Noork notices he can see a foot of one of them because it was covered with mud. He throws overripe fruit at the group, and the fruit stains their cloaks, enabling Noork to see them. The Misty Ones capture girls to be slave sacrifices to their god, but they also capture men who work for them in their fields and gardens and others who move through the skull all chained together. They are led by priests who also wear cloaks that make them invisible and colorful feathers along with a face shield that enables them to see the other Misty Ones in their cloaks. Once Noork discovers that the Misty Ones are like everyone else, the Misty Ones lose the advantage of the fear they engender in others and risk death at their hands.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The Misty Ones are a group of people who mostly dwell on the island of Manak. They control a group of slaves on the island and manage the sacrificial rituals for the gods they worship, Uzdon and Lornu. To complete these sacrifices, they habitually capture and imprison young women from around the land of Zura, and they choose the youngest and most beautiful to sacrifice. The Misty Ones inspire fear in the hearts of the Vasads and other peoples of Zura due to their mysterious nature and their ability to move about invisibly. However, their weakness is revealed when Noork discovers they are not completely invisible after all, and their \u201cskin\u201d (an invisibility robe) can be easily removed. Noork has his friend Ud pass this message along to Gurn and his Vasads to encourage them to no longer fear the Misty Ones. This tactic works, and the Vasads show up just in time to save the day."

There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that.

A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell.

Strangely enough, however, the ship turns away and moves away from him.\n\nSeven years later, a newspaper on Earth publishes a story that Willard\u2019s son, J. Willard II, plans to build a larger version of his father\u2019s ship, the Mary Lou II, in memory of his father, but Willard Sr. is unaware of this. He continues to experience excruciating loneliness and dreams about his life on Earth\u2014the people he knew, the sounds, and the cities. One day a giant rocket ship comes alongside the Mary Lou, and Willard is thrilled that he has been discovered. But the vessel turns away and leaves. Willard notices that he can see starlight through the ship and realizes it is the Ghost Ship. \n\nOne day he sees another ship and, at first, fears the Ghost Ship has returned. The new ship looks solid, though, and it contacts him, addressing the Mary Lou by name. Willard believes that this ship will take him back to Earth and eagerly boards it. Willard is kept drugged for a while but eventually is alert enough to speak with the captain. When Willard asks when they will return to Earth, the captain explains that they cannot return because matter in space loses its mass and energy until nothing is left. If they tried to return to Earth, they would pass through it. Willard then realizes he is on the Ghost Ship, and he is one of its Ghosts.  \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Galactic Ghost begins with death. John Willard is taking care of his co-pilot and best friend, Larry Dobbin as he dies. A meteor struck their rocket ship, the Mary Lou, and damaged both her and Dobbin. As Dobbin dies, Willard gently takes care of him and lifts him up to the port so he can see the stars one last time. Just before he passes, Dobbin cries out and says he saw the infamous ghost ship. It steals dying spacemen who have no hope of returning to Earth, cursing them to spend the rest of their lives as ghosts in space. \nAfter Dobbin passes, Willard watches over him for two days before removing his body and turning it into energy for the useless engine in the Mary Lou. Although the ship is livable, it is not flyable. Taking careful diligence to check every part of the ship, Willard manages to keep the Mary Lou from completely shutting down. He transforms waste into food and learns to survive. \nTwo years of great loneliness and despair pass. As Willard looks out the port, he sees blinking stars. Excited, he investigates and realizes that it was an old-fashioned spaceship from decades ago. He soon sees that half of it is invisible, hence the blinking star phenomenon. As the ship gets closer, his sensors remain quiet. Putting it all together, he concludes that this is the Ghost Ship, but pushes the thought away, claiming it\u2019s impossible. Slowly, the ship turns around and travels away from him. \nFlash forward seven more years and a newspaper published a story about Willard and Dobbin on Earth. Sadly, he would never get to see it. Willard\u2019s son was about to create his own ship called Mary Lou II to honor his father. Willard spends his years alone trying to survive and also trying to fight off his memories of home, as they torture him. He kept up with the days and nights of Earth for many years and made his bed. But the memories of his old friends, the cities he lived in, and the crunch of snow beneath his feet drove him mad. Quickly, he lost track of the days. Another ship came and went, torturing him with hope yet again. \nAlmost twenty years passed and he grew more anguished every day. A ship came toward him and asked if he wanted to board, seeing as his ship was unlivable. Grateful he had checked the space suit beforehand, Willard traveled to the other ship and quickly fell into a deep sleep, exhausted by his years of solitude. After being drugged and evaded, Willard finally gets to speak to the captain of the ship on the third week who reveals that this is the Ghost Ship. Willard was only able to perceive the Ghost Ship because he and the Mary Lou were already ghosts, faded to the human eye. They are only shells on the Ghost Ship, and Willard is doomed to join them forever. ",
        "Summary_3": "John Willard's and Larry Dobbin's ship the \"Mary Lou\" had been damaged by a meteor during its mission to explore a small planet beyond Pluto, and Willard and Dobbin are waiting to die in space. Eventually, Dobbin dies, and he claims to see the fabled \"Ghost Ship\" seconds before his passing. After Dobbin's death, Willard manages to stay alive thanks to the machines that could convert waste into food and air. Willard spends two years alone, lost in hopeless thought and agony. Eventually, he sees a blinking shape in the distance, which he soon determines is an old-fashioned rocket ship. However, his instruments indicate there is no ship despite what he sees. Willard oscillates between doubting his own vision and believing there must be a scientific explanation for it. As he struggles with these thoughts, the ship leaves, and Willard spends seven years alone. Meanwhile, back on Earth, a newspaper from his hometown of Arden publishes an obituary of Willard and Dobbin indicating Willard\u2019s son\u2019s intention to build a \u201cMary Lou II.\u201d Willard recalls memories with his wife and co-workers and the feeling of walking around Arden. He thinks about the legend of the Ghost Ship, which is said to come for the spacemen who die in space alone. A few years pass, and Willard sees the Ghost Ship pass close to him and turn away again, appearing to taunt him. He begins to lose track of time and guesses that as many as twenty years pass; he spends his days going through the motions of managing the ship as he feels himself aging physically. Then, he sees a ship approach, and this time it is a real ship. The ship sends out a rescue calls and retrieves Willard from the \u201cMary Lou.\u201d Willard spends the next few days reacquainting himself with human interaction and struggling with the horrible memories of his decades in solitude. Then, he starts to realize something is off about the crew of the ship that rescued him. They will not engage him in any conversation other than the operations of the ship. When Willard meets the captain later, he reveals he actually is on the Ghost Ship after all. It only appeared solid to Willard the more the \u201cMary Lou\u201d lost its mass and energy and itself became a kind of \u201cghost ship\u201d through its aimless wandering through space. Willard realizes he is dead and will never again return to Earth. ",
        "Summary_4": "John Willard and Larry Dobbin are the lone space explorers aboard the Mary Lou, a ship that can\u2019t move due to meteor damage. As the story begins, WIllard tries to comfort Dobbin as Dobbin dies. Before passing away, Dobbin sees what he believes to be \u201cThe Ghost Ship\u201d, a fabled ship that comes for dying spacemen. Willard believes Ghost Ships are just fairy tales and that Dobbin was delirious. \n\nTwo years later, Willard sees what looks like a partially invisible rocket ship, though his ship\u2019s control board shows no sign of anything. As the ship turns away and disappears, Willard wonders if he imagined it or if it could be The Ghost Ship, but decides that is impossible. \n\nSeven more years go by, and we read a small article from Willard and Dobbin\u2019s hometown newspaper (that we are told Willard will never see), about the thirteenth anniversary of Willard and Dobbin embarking on their mission, how they have never been heard from again, and how Willard\u2019s son is having a large spaceship manufactured in his father\u2019s honor. \n\nBack on the Mary Lou, Willard can\u2019t help but dream of his Earth days each night. He grows more and more despondent and thinks about Ghost Ships. He stops looking out the window, and isn\u2019t sure if fifteen or twenty years have passed. He wonders if he has gone mad when he sees a ship coming. Everything changes when he realizes that it\u2019s a real ship that taps out a real message on his space-telegrapher.\n\nThe other ship invites him to come aboard and he gratefully accepts, boarding it and immediately falling asleep. Over the next few weeks he drifts in and out of consciousness, knowing that he must be being drugged but also realizing it would be difficult for him to acclimate to being around others so soon. His memories start to come back and his mind starts to clear, and he notices that none of the men caring for him want to give him any information or answer his questions. \n\nAfter Willard awakens fully, one of the men says he\u2019ll get the captain, who wanted to see Willard when he came to. The captain comes to see him, and Willard notices that he is very old. He tells the captain that he can\u2019t wait to get to Earth and asks when they\u2019ll go. The captain explains that after floating around in space for as long as they and Willard have, things and people lose their mass and energy. Willard hadn\u2019t yet lost his twenty years ago, which is why their ship didn\u2019t look fully formed to him then. Now that he has, he is just a shell like them and can see them fully. \n\nAs Willard puts the pieces together, the captain explains that they can\u2019t go to Earth because they would pass right through it. Willard realizes that this is, in fact, a Ghost Ship, and that they are the ghosts, and the captain confirms this. \n"

But Willard wasn't superstitions.\n   \n  He had seen the phantom\u2014and lived.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come\u2014for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n<doc-sep>Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND\u2014ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Both Dobbin and Willard have memories of Earth that sadden them and make them lonely. As Dobbin is dying, he remembers his life on Earth, and his greatest regret is that he will never see it again. Dobbin is satisfied with his life and experiences, but his Earth-loneliness prevents him from dying a happy man. Willard is also pained by his memories of Earth and what he has lost and will never have again. Alone in space, Willard considers his memories the only things of value to him. Because his memories cause him so much pain, Willard tries to ignore them or remove them, but they return in his dreams. His memories in his dreams are full of sensory details and other details that he did not notice when he was on Earth. However, when Willard is drugged and sleeping on the Ghost Ship, his dreams are of memories from the years he spent on the Mary Lou, and his dreams about people that he knew are unpleasant. Willard believes that if he could walk on Earth one more time, he would die a happy man.",
        "Summary_2": "Memories are both joys for Willard as well as his greatest anguish. The memories of his time on Earth, the sound of his friend\u2019s voices, the feel of the ground beneath his feet, and even the sounds of the buildings and the city torture him since it gives him something to hope for. \nHe is not able to let go of his life because he longs to survive and live out the rest of his days on Earth. He spends almost 20 years alone while in space, holding on to his memories to keep him going. Unlike Dobbin, memories became Willard\u2019s constant companion and the only thing that lasted with him throughout his time aboard the Mary Lou. \nIn the end, though, his memories basically haunted and tormented him. He would push them away, only to dream of them at night. His memories broke him and, without anyone beside him, Willard slowly faded away into nothing more than a shell of a man. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Memories function as a link to reality for Willard. The more he struggles to stay sane during his long periods of isolation, the more he relies on his vivid memories of Earth\u2014walking along the streets of Arden, hearing the voices of his co-workers and scientists he used to know, the voices of his friends and wife\u2013to keep him alive. Even as the \u201cMary Lou\u201d slowly begins to lose its energy and shape and become a \u201cghost ship\u201d, Willard is not aware that this process is even happening because his memories keep him grounded in a kind of reality. In this reality, his memories keep Willard alive because Willard believes he is alive and that a real ship has come to save him. The idea of returning to Earth and seeing those memories come to life again keeps Willard going for all those decades.",
        "Summary_4": "Memories are very significant in the story, because they both sustain Willard\u2019s will to keep going and torment him when he is at his lowest points. He dreams of his Earth days at night and longs to hear the voices of his friends, family, and coworkers, and to see Earth again. When he is rescued by The Ghost Ship, he tells the Captain that the idea of seeing Earth is all that has kept him going. His Earth memories have also made him feel even lonelier as he has floated through space, and now on The Ghost Ship his memories of being stranded on the Mary Lou haunt him in his nightmares. His memories have alternately been a struggle and a lifeline, but are ultimately what have kept him connected to his humanity. \n"

        "Summary_1": "John Willard considers Larry Dobbin his best friend. They are both astronauts in a rocket ship that was on a voyage past Pluto to explore a possible planetoid. Their ship was struck by a meteor and can no longer fly, so they are drifting through space. When the story opens, Dobbin is dying. His breathing is erratic, and his fingertips are black. Dobbin has accepted his impending death, but Willard tries to convince Dobbin that he is not dying and that they will return to Earth. Dobbin longs to return to Earth and regrets that he will not see it again. He remembers his first space flight as Willard raises him to look out the port window at the stars. Before he dies, Dobbin declares that the Ghost Ship has come for him. He points to it out the window, but Willard does not see it. Willard believes that Dobbin has gone mad. Dobbin then dies. Dobbin is mentioned in a newspaper account thirteen years after the men left on their voyage when Willard\u2019s son builds a larger version of their ship called the Mary Lou II. The article indicates they were never heard from again. \n",

They went to space to explore the possibility of another planetoid hidden beyond Pluto. \nLarry Dobbin, as Willard\u2019s companion and confidante, operated the Mary Lou from the control board, possibly co-piloting with Willard. \nHowever, less than five years into their adventure, the Mary Lou was struck by a meteor, which damaged the Mary Lou to no repair but only in certain areas. The meteor did not damage the assimilators and convertors, which meant the ship was livable, but not moveable. However, assumedly during the meteor strike, Dobbin was severely injured. At the beginning of the story, he is dying and sees a ship far in the distance. He claims it\u2019s the ghost ship coming to take him away. After spotting the ship, Dobbin quickly passes. Willard mourns respectfully and follows the vigil ritual. Two days later, Willard disposed of Dobbin\u2019s body, and his atoms were converted into pure energy for the Mary Lou. ",
        "Summary_3": "Larry Dobbin is Willard\u2019s closest friend and fellow explorer who joins Willard on the \u201cMary Lou.\u201d Their mission is to journey to a small planet that lies beyond Pluto. At some point in their expedition, a meteor hits their ship and damages it, causing the \u201cMary Lou\u201d to drift through unknown space, unable to return to Earth. Dobbin becomes sick during this period, and Willard realizes he is going to die. Dobbin hopes to return to Earth prior to his death, and Willard entertains this fantasy in order to give him some hope and peace before his passing. Dobbin remembers his first journey into space, and as he peers out into the abyss towards the end of his life, he exclaims that he sees the Ghost Ship\u2014a legend amongst sailors and spacemen who claim people see such a ship in the moments before death. Dobbin dies shortly after announcing his vision, and Willard is left alone.",

They embarked on a voyage to explore a planetoid beyond Pluto, and were never heard from on Earth again. As the story begins, they are four years into the mission and Dobbin is dying of an unspecified illness that has turned his finger tips black and made it difficult for him to breathe or speak. Willard lifts him to the window of the ship so he can see the stars one last time, and Dobbin says he sees The Ghost Ship and that it has come for him because he is dying.

        "Summary_1": "There are legends and tall tales about the Ghost Ships, told mainly by drunken men and professional storytellers. Willard remembers that there are stories on Earth about Ghost Ships that sail the Seven Seas. The story goes that the crews of Ghost Ships have broken a particular law, and their punishment is to roam forever. The Ghost Ship in space is said to be the home of spacemen who could not return to Earth. When Dobbin is dying, he claims to see the Ghost Ship and that it has come for him, but when Willard looks for the ship, he does not see it. Later, when Willard sees the Ghost Ship for himself for the first time, he tries to convince himself it is not really there. He remembers the stories about oceangoing Ghost Ships and reasons that there could also be Ghost Ships in space. When the Ghost Ship turns to leave, Willard is almost sorry to see it go because he has been so lonely. When the Ghost Ship appears to Willard for the second time, it has pulled alongside the Mary Lou, and Willard thinks it is a real ship. Only when the Ghost Ship abruptly speeds away and Willard sees stars shining through it does Willard realize it was the Ghost Ship, and he believes it is mocking him. With his third sighting of the Ghost Ship, Willard immediately thinks it is the Ghost Ship but then convinces himself it is not when it messages him. After he is on the ship, he realizes it is indeed the Ghost Ship and that he is now a Ghost. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Ghost Ship is a tale told by spacemen to frighten each other or warn them of this grave possibility. Many of those that came close to death in space, or those who witnessed others dying with no hope of a return to earth, mentioned seeing a ghost ship. A faint outline of a ship that had come to take them away forever. Before Dobbin\u2019s death at the story of the story, he tells Willard that he sees the ghost ship. \nThis ghost ship serves as another form of torture for Willard during his many years of solitude. The ghost ship would essentially check up on him, float by and see if he was still alive or not. This gave Willard false hope as he would dream that the ghost ship was a real rocket ship that was coming to rescue him. In the end, Willard is taken away by a ghost ship, though he thinks it\u2019s a rescue ship initially, and he is doomed to forever fly through the solar system as a ghost and nothing more. There is no hope for his return to Earth. The men of the ghost ship are truly ghosts, invisible to the naked eye and only visible to those on their deathbeds. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Ghost Ship is a legend that sailors and space travelers alike have claimed people see in the moments before they die at sea or in space. In the seconds before Dobbin dies in Willard\u2019s arms, he looks out the window of the \u201cMary Lou\u201d and claims to see the Ghost Ship himself. Throughout Willard\u2019s long periods of solitude aboard the \u201cMary Lou\u201d, he thinks he sees the Ghost Ship several times. First, from a distance, as a blinking light advancing closer and closer before turning back and sailing off into dark space; later, he thinks he sees the ship return, only this time it passes nearer before turning back and leaving again. With each return of the Ghost Ship, Willard believes he sees it clearer than he had before. After decades adrift in space, Willard believes a ship has finally come to rescue him. He does not think it is the Ghost Ship because it is solid, and he is greeted by a crew of people. However, the captain explains that the longer a vessel spends lost in space, the more it loses itself and slips into a kind of un-reality, along with those aboard. The more the \u201cMary Lou\u201d drifted into this space, the more real the Ghost Ship became to Willard. Willard realizes that the \u201cMary Lou\u201d has become a \u201cghost ship\u201d herself.",
        "Summary_4": "Ghost Ships frame the story and the idea of them haunts Willard on and off throughout it. At the beginning, when Dobbin exclaims that he sees a Ghost Ship prior to his death, Willard tells himself that it was a hallucination from somewhere deep in his dying friend\u2019s subconscious, just the result of the memory of an old legend. However, the idea of a Ghost Ship never really leaves Willard\u2019s mind throughout the rest of the story. When he sees a partially transparent rocket ship that turns away and disappears, he wonders if it could be a Ghost Ship but talks himself out of it. Later he wonders if it was a ghost ship that was \u201cmocking him\u201d. When he is rescued by a ship that looks more real, the thought still crosses his mind that it could be a Ghost Ship and he again shuts the idea down. Ultimately, Ghost Ships are incredibly significant in the story, because it turns out that both the Mary Lou, and his rescue ship/new home, while not exactly like the tall tale, are, in effect, Ghost Ships. \n"

Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND\u2014ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Larry Dobbin and John Willard are astronauts together in space on a mission to explore a planetoid beyond Pluto. When a meteor damages their rocket, they both realize they will never return to Earth. Willard considers Dobbin the best friend he has ever had friend, and when Dobbin is dying, Willard tries to keep his spirits up by telling him that he has a new plan for a way for them to return to Earth. When Dobbin wants to see the stars one last time before he dies, Willard raises him so that he can see them out the port window. When Dobbins sees the Ghost Ship and says that it has come for him, Willard assures him that nothing is there. After Dobbin dies, Willard holds a wake for him for two days before he recycles Dobbin\u2019s body because the ship can still break down waste and refuse to create food and air. Afterward, Willard regrets disposing of Dobbin\u2019s body. With Dobbin gone, Willard experiences great pain and loneliness. Eventually, Willard sees the Ghost Ship and knows that his friend was right about it.",
        "Summary_2": "Dobbin and Willard are close friends, companions, and colleagues. As they co-pilot and run the Mary Lou together in outer space, their relationship continued to develop. Willard even said that Dobbin was his sole friend in space. Being the only two people on board the Mary Lou brought them closer together and helped their relationship evolve. \nAlthough the reader does not see them together much, the effects of Dobbin on Willard are very evident and show how close the two of them were. Willard watched over his body for two Earth days before respectfully disposing of it. This dedication to his brethren shows how close the two of them became. \n",
        "Summary_3": "John Willard and Larry Dobbin are both spacemen piloting the \u201cMary Lou\u201d on a mission to explore a small planet far away from Earth, past Pluto. Due to their isolation and sheer amount of time spent together, they become close friends. In fact, they are the only friends each other has ever had in outer space. Following the meteor strike that disables their ship, Willard understands Dobbin\u2019s desire to return to Earth as well as the importance of having hope that such a return would one day be possible. Willard offers Dobbin support in his dying moments, holding him up so he can see out the window. This is when Dobbin sees the Ghost Ship right before passing away. Dobbin\u2019s vision would influence Willard\u2019s struggle between belief and disbelief throughout the remainder of his time in space.",
        "Summary_4": "Dobbin and Willard are the two space explorers aboard the Mary Lou, a ship bound to explore past Pluto. At the beginning of the story, Willard describes Dobbin as his only friend in space, and the best friend he ever had. The loss of Dobbin sends Willard into a spiral of loneliness and depression that lasts decades, as Dobbin was his only companion and connection to Earth. Dobbin only survives the first few paragraphs of the story, but he continues to have an influence on his colleague and friend. Dobbin believed he saw The Ghost Ship before he died, and the idea of that sticks with Willard throughout the rest of his journey aboard the Mary Lou and beyond, despite his skepticism. \n"

        "Summary_1": "As the story opens, Ambassador Magnan briefs Councillor Retief on the Terrestrial Embassy\u2019s request for sponsorship of youth groups on the planet Fust.  Councillor Retief is not interested. Magnan specifically suggests that Retief sponsor the group SCARS (Sexual, Cultural and Athletic Recreational Society), and warns Retief that the rival Groaci may fill any void. Retief suggests researching the youth groups before giving them money. Magnan is dismissive. Retief is still not interested, and leaves to go look at plans for a new passenger liner being built by the Fustians. \nRetief takes a flat-car to the ship yard and meets Whonk, who is a shipyard clerk. He asks to see the blueprints, which he photographs. He and Whonk chat about the attitude of the youth, and Whonk blames it on their new leader, Slock, who hangs around with Yith, a member of the Groaci embassy.\nLater, while Retief is on his way home to dress for a dinner and press event organized by Magnan, two Fustian youths threaten him on the bus. Retief realizes that they were after his photos, which showed that the ship under construction was a battle cruiser, not a passenger liner. He also realizes that Whonk may be in danger. Retief escapes the youths and races back to the shipyard to find that Whonk has been dragged off and tied up in a warehouse. From the Fustian\u2019s wounds, Retief realized that they had tried to kill him.\nRetief figures out that the Fustian youths have taken some titanite, an explosive, over to a ship called the Moss Rock, which would be full of dignitaries later. He and Whonk race over there and encounter more Fustians, and win a fight with them, effectively breaking up the Groaci-backed plot to blow up the ship. \nRetief arrives at the banquet a little late, and exchanges a few words with Magnan, who proceeds to make the Fustians miserable with his cultural insensitivity. A few minutes later, the SCARS leader, Slock, arrives. Retief reveals Slock\u2019s plan: Slock, backed by the Groaci, was planning to take over Fust. The Groaci tried to frame the Terrestrial Embassy for the plot.\nSlock escaped. Retief went back toward the Moss Rock, where Whonk tackled Slock, and Retief accosted Yith. Whonk wanted to take revenge on Yith for attacking him earlier, but Retief instead negotiated a deal in which Yith, who had mastered removing the Fustian carapace surgically, which would be a great relief to Whonk and other elders, would agree to do so in return for not being ritually dismembered. Just as this agreement was completed, Slock tried to escape again, but Whonk dumped him on the Moss Rock, and set the autopilot for Groaci, still full of titanite. It blew up on the way there.\nMagnan wrested what he could, diplomatically speaking, from the wreckage of the youth sponsorship program and moved on to plans to sponsor Senior Citizens Groups.\n",
        "Summary_2": "This story follows Retief, a Terrestrial diplomat working on the surface of the Fustian planet, where these two species co-exist with the Groaci. At the start of the story, Retief is talking to the Terrestrial Ambassador about a new program that the Fustians are looking for sponsorship for, that the Ambassador wants Retief to take care of. Retief, the Councillor, does not seem interested, and heads out to the shipyards to ask the people there some questions about a new ship being built. An older Fustian named Whonk allows him to see the plans for the ship and tells Retief about Slock, one of the local leaders of the Youths that seems to be a bad influence. These troublesome characters showed up to talk to Whonk and scare Retief off of the docks as Retief slips out unnoticed. He finds plans in the Embassy's library for an old battle cruiser that match the plans for the new ship, pointing him towards a plot to re-introduce weapons into the society. He finds Whonk, injured from the others' attempt to extract information from him, and the two of them piece together the clues: there was titanite, a dangerous explosive, that is going to be placed on the fanciest boat at the docks, the Moss Rock. When they get to that ship to take a look, they find a variety of items emblazoned with the logo of SCARS, the Youth Group that Ambassador Magnan wanted Retief to sponsor at the beginning. Retief figures that these items are here as planted false evidence, so that the explosion would be pinned on the Youth Group, and thus the Terrestrials by extension. Retief's goal is to destroy this plot--Whonk captures a Fustian who they realize has had his shell surgically removed, something that they thought impossible. Retief takes this to mean that the Groaci have more medical knowledge than they realized, and that they are responsible for this plot. In order to expose this plan, he heads to the banquet where the sponsorship of the Youth Group is being announced. He interrupts the Ambassador's grand announcement, exposing the plot to the press that was already gathered there. He knew Slock to be a gang leader, told everyone of the plan to blow up the Moss Rock and his deal with the Groaci, and then runs toward the boat with Whonk and the Ambassador. Whonk wanted to follow through with his society's classic ceremonial revenge against Yith, the Groaci at the ship, but Retief convinces them to have a sort of trade: Yith would share the medical knowledge to remove Whonk's heavy outer shell so that it would no longer be a nuisance and a heavyweight, and Slock is thrown onto the Moss Rock as it leaves the docks and explodes. With the plot exposed, the Ambassador wants to move on to more social projects, but Retief heads out for a fishing vacation with his new friend Whonk.",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins with a meeting between Ambassador Magnan and Councillor Retief, who represents the Terrestrial Embassy on the planet Fust. The planet is populated with turtle-like creatures called Fustians (the younger Fustians lack the hard shell of the mature ones). Magnan assigns Retief the mission of sponsoring a new youth movement there called the Sexual, Cultural, Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS). Instead, Retief prefers to investigate a new passenger ship being built by the Fustians. Upon his arrival at the shipyard, Retief meets Whonk, an elderly Fustian who maintains documents, and he shows Retief the blueprints for the new ship. A young Fustian named Slock enters and arouses Retief\u2019s suspicions by inquiring what he wants with the plans. After he leaves the shipyard, Retief is attacked by two young Fustians, and he returns to find Whonk has been attacked as well. Retief notices a stain on the ground that Whonk tells him is a remnant of four drums belonging to the Groaci\u2014an alien species that operated a competing embassy. Retief had seen interacting a Groaci attache interacting with the youth that had attacked him earlier. The drums had been loaded onto a boat called \"Moss Rock.\" After identifying the smelly stain as an explosive called titanite, Retief and Whonk go to \"Moss Rock\" and discover a box containing a SCARS uniform. While there, they are attacked by an older-looking youth Fustian and discover that he is not a youth at all; rather, his shell has been removed by some mysterious method. They ward off another attack by his friends, and Retief decides to head to the sponsorship ceremony, realizing that the Groaci are likely taking advantage of the SCARS group's distaste for Fustian leadership to advance their plot to bomb \"Moss Rock\". At the sponsorship ceremony, Ambassador Magnan introduces Slock as guest of honor, and Retief and Whonk seize the opportunity to apprehend him and explain his deal with the Groaci to the press: The Groaci would supply weapons, and Slock would make sure they were installed on the ship. The SCARS uniforms found at the scene of the exploded ship would implicate them along with the Terrestrial Embassy, because of its sponsorship of SCARS. Magnan notes that Slock was scheduled to be on the ship, and Retief rebuts that this reveals the Groaci's intention to get rid of Slock after he'd done their bidding. Thus, the disaster at \"Moss Rock\" would cement the Groaci's control of Fust. Retief returns to the \"Moss Rock\" and captures the Groaci diplomat Yith, and Whonk captures Slock, whom they both discover has also had his shell surgically removed to appear younger. Retief makes a deal with Whonk to spare Yith's life in exchange for the same shell-removal surgery. Whonk takes his revenge on Slock by placing him back on the \"Moss Rock\" and exploding the ship with the titanite barrels on its course to Groaci. Retief informs Magnan that this display will prevent the Groaci from pursuing any further action against Fust.",
        "Summary_4": "Ambassador Magnan wants Retief, the Councillor working with him at the Terrestrial Embassy, to sponsor the Fustian youth group the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS), but Retief isn\u2019t interested. Instead, he wants to check out the new passenger liner that the Fustians are building, but he does express concern about the Groaci\u2019s interest in Fust, which has a steel-age manufacturing economy while Groaci is into crude atomics. At the shipyards, an old Fustian named Whonk shows him the blueprints for the new passenger liner. Retief takes photographs of the blueprints to study them later. Slock, a young Fustian, comes with a Groaci Embassy military attache and beats up on Whonk while Retief sneaks out the back.\n\nLater in the day, Retief has to attend a dinner where the sponsor for the SCARS youth group will be announced. On the way, he is accosted by two Fustain youth who tell him they want the films for the pictures he took of the blueprints. Retief manages to elude them. He has looked at pictures and realized they are plans for a replica of a battlecruiser used two hundred years ago and has gun placements. Retief realizes that Whonk must have told them about his pictures and knows that he wouldn\u2019t tell them willingly, so he goes to Whonk\u2019s office to look for him. He sees signs of a struggle and finds Whonk tied up behind some bales where he is out of sight. Whonk reveals he was attacked by a Groaci, Slock, and his cohorts, and they tried to kill him. Retief recognizes the smell of an explosive, and Whonk tells him drums of it have been placed on a barge called Moss Rock. \n\nRetief and Whonk decide to go back to the Embassy but are attacked by one of the young Fustians who attacked Whonk earlier that day. As they wrestle with him, they pull off his cloak to discover that his carapace has been removed, so he isn\u2019t really a youth. Whonk is stunned because he believed it wasn\u2019t possible to remove a carapace without killing the Fustian. \n\nAt the dinner, Magnan announces that Retief has won the \u201cbidding\u201d to sponsor the SCARS. Retief sneaks up on Slock and tells Magnan that he has figured out that the Groaci are planning to take over a local world and then branch out to more worlds. They have been using the young Fustians to help them set up their attack but planned to kill them after everything was ready. Retief catches a Groaci, and Whonk wants to kill him, but Retief gets him to promise to have the Groaci surgeon remove the carapaces from the older Fustians like Whonk. When Retief reports the scheme to Magnan, he tells his superior that the Moss Rock is headed for Groaci and will explode there, ending their problems with the Groaci.\n"

A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled.

He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door.

Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\n  \n \n  Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n  \n \n  The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\n   \n   Lament of\nHatching\n   \n  ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n  \n \n  \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n  \n \n  \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n  \n \n  The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Fustians somewhat resemble gigantic, intelligent snapping turtles, and like turtles, start life as eggs. During their youth and adolescence, they are relatively agile and have no shells (unlike turtles). It is notable how many Fustian elders take a dim view of adolescents, with the Minister of Fust himself saying that the Youth should be \u201ckept penned with the livestock until they grow a carapace to tame their irresponsibility.\u201d\nWhen Fustians mature, they develop an enormous, horny carapace which they are obliged to carry around on their backs for the rest of their lives, which last over a thousand years. The carapaces cause the adult Fustians to be slow-moving, and they take up a lot of space \u2013 hence their public transportation consists of flat-cars instead of buses with seats. Unfortunately, not much is known by off-worlders of Fustian females.\nLike most intelligent races, Fustians enjoy music. The frequencies at which their music is played are subsonic, and therefore not audible to the human ear. Likewise, their ears are quite sensitive to high frequencies, such as those produced by tapping on a crystal glass with a spoon. This is not just unpleasant, but painful to Fustian ears.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Fustians are similar to tortoises in build, with yellow eyes, scales, and very thick hides that leak purple blood when cut. They have a much longer life-cycle than humans, as those that are 75 years of age are still considered to be teenagers or even youths. \n\nAs Faustians age, they grow larger, their voices get deeper, and they eventually acquire very heavy shells. It is past their current medical knowledge to safely remove the shells, though we find out at the end of the story that the Groaci have discovered a technique that allows them to do this. This is important because the shells slow the older Fustians down and are often considered a nuisance. When they are young, they are very secretive, and wary of strangers from other groups and species. The older Fustians do not seem to mind the humans (and aliens in general) as much, and sometimes apologize for the behavior of the younger ones. It seems that they wish they could do more to control their behavior, but the younger ones are physically much faster and can escape attempts at control. It also seems to be the case that this difference in behavior is more acute now than it has been in the past, perhaps due to social pressures from other groups. \n\nSleep is very important to them, and regular greetings in day-to-day life include well wishes for a long rest, as well as specific types of dreams. When they are angry or want to insult someone, they wish nightmares upon them. They have regular siesta times during the work day. Sleep is so important to them that they have a National Dirge called the Lament of Hatching. Ceremonial revenge is also important to them: although the older Fustians are not necessarily quick to anger, they follow through once they have been wronged. ",
        "Summary_3": "Fustians are a species turtle-like in their appearance. They have very long lives; in fact, the average age of a Fustian youth is seventy-five years old. As they age, they develop a hard-shell on their backs, which is quite heavy and hard. This causes them to move slower as they get older. The younger Fustians can move quite fast in comparison. However, the older Fustians appear to be a great deal stronger and can hold their own in combat, as demonstrated by Whonk when he defends himself against Slock\u2019s cronies and eventually captures Slock. The elderly Fustians also grow thicker skin, which is what ultimately prevents Whonk from being decapitated when he is first attacked. Fustians have turtle-like mouths that snap when they are angry. Steel manufacturing fuels their economy. While older Fustians are generally hospitable and patient, the younger Fustians have become frustrated with the ways of the elderly Fustian leadership, and their drive to change things blinds them to being manipulated by the Groaci. Although weapons are illegal on Fust, the younger Fustians seem willing to break this rule by accepting weapons from the Groaci in exchange for their knowledge of the ships.",
        "Summary_4": "The Fustians look like turtles and have extremely long lifespans. Younger Fustians do not have a carapace, but older ones do, which can be quite heavy. Seventy-five-year-olds are considered youths, like teenagers, because they can live for about two thousand years. The 75-year-olds have a reputation as being at a trying age. As Whonk explains to Retief, the youth have a reputation for \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cdiscourtesy.\u201d The Elders feel that there is little they can do about the youths' misbehavior since the Elders are so much slower with their carapaces. They have no police and have never needed them until the youth became so unruly. They have a youth group, the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS), that needs a sponsor and wants someone to provide them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment, and so forth. The Fustians\u2019 dwellings have a fishy odor and are found along a broad cobbled street. They have a caste system; the driver of a flat car is a member of the labor caste. Their greetings relate to peaceful sleep: \u201cLong-may-you-sleep\u201d and \u201cMay-you-dream-of-the-deeps.\u201d Likewise, their insults related to unpleasant sleep: \u201cMay you toss in nightmares!\u201d The oldest Fustians are forced into retirement and given once-daily feedings; Whonk says this is nothing to look forward to for his next thousand years. They have a strong sense of right and wrong and carry out ceremonial revenge when wronged."

Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Magnan is the Ambassador to Fust, and thus is Retief\u2019s boss. He is also a spineless, political wind-sniffing clod. His main role, or function in the story is as a foil to the hero, Retief. Magnan\u2019s clueless blathering sets up Retief\u2019s dry, sarcastic remarks \u2013 remarks which, if Magnan were not so oblivious, would perhaps offend Magnan to the point of firing Retief. \nWhile Retief is running around Fust getting into fist fights and spoiling terrorists\u2019 plots, Magnan is back at the office shuffling whatever papers came in from the Terrestrial Embassy that day, implementing the \u201cprogram of the week.\u201d Magnan is flat. Retief is three-dimensional.\nMagnan\u2019s main contributions to the story are to: \n1.\tIgnore Retief\u2019s advice to check out the Fustian youth organizations before sponsoring them, which leads to the potential for the Terrestrial Embassy being embarrassed by the Groaci attempts to frame SCARS for the explosion they hoped to cause aboard the Moss Rock. \n2.\tSet up the banquet to honor SCARS where he grossly insults his Fustian counterparts by having the hired musicians play a dirge, the \u201cLament of Hatching,\u201d and then shattering their ear drums by tapping on his wine glass.\n3.\tWhip up a meringue of obfuscation to hide the fiasco of the youth organization sponsorship program and try to make himself smell like a rose in the process\n4.\tStart a new sponsorship program for Fustian Senior Citizens.\nAt no point in the story does he do anything useful at all.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Magnan is the Terrestrial Ambassador to the Fustians. He is the figurehead of their influence on the Fustian planet, and works closely with Retief, the Terrestrial diplomat who uncovers a plot against the Terrestrials through the course of the story. He is the man who tries to convince Retief to sponsor the Youth Group SCARS in the beginning of the story, and we encounter him at the banquet near the end of the story. As the figurehead, he is responsible for announcing the role of the Terrestrials in funding the Youth Group, which creates an opportunity for Retief to announce the Grocian plot to everyone. Ambassador Magnan eventually joins Retief and Whonk as they leave the event to stop the criminals, but he is thrown into an alley by Whonk and doesn't have an opportunity to help directly. After the issue is dealt with by Whonk and Retief, Magnan resumes normal duty, and as the story ends he is looking at other groups that his government could potentially fund.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Magnan is an ambassador with the Terrestrial Embassy, and he assigns Retief the mission to sponsor the new youth movement (SCARS) on the planet Fust. Magnan seems eager for this sponsorship to proceed despite his general ignorance about the movement itself. His motivation for speed rather than understanding may be attributed to the haste with which the Groaci Embassy has moved to establish a connection with SCARS. Magnan, of course, is not aware of the secret dealings between the Groaci and the SCARS, whom they are working with to ultimately supplant the Fustian leadership and take control of the planet for themselves. Magnan\u2019s vision is fairly straightforward and views this sponsorship as the surest way to curry good favor with the Fustians (and get good publicity for the Terrestrial Embassy). Magnan is impatient with Retief\u2019s more meticulous, fact-finding methods and organizes the sponsorship ceremony before Retief has completed his research. At the ceremony, Magnan\u2019s interactions with the Fustian minister reveal further his humorous ignorance about their species, particularly when he hurts their sensitive hearing by banging his glass louder and louder. After he invites Slock on stage to present him to the press as his guest of honor and representative of SCARS, Whonk and Retief capture Slock and expose his plan to Magnan. At first, Magnan does not believe them, but he is quickly convinced when Slock escapes. In the end, Magnan creates a story for the press that the sponsorship event was a ruse to apprehend the perpetrators of the attempted coup against the Fustian leadership. ",
        "Summary_4": "Magnan is the Ambassador at the Terrestrial Embassy on Fust and Councillor Retief\u2019s boss. He wants Retief to sponsor the SCARS and stops just short of ordering him to do so. Magnan is very focused on his role as Ambassador and has little interest in anything not directly connected to his job. Magnan is not concerned about the passenger ship the Fustians are building or the fact that the Groacis are interested in the Fustians when their lives and economies are so different from each other. When Retief mentions the fact that the Groacis are interested in fission bombs, Magnan\u2019s reaction is to wonder what market there could be for such devices since the world is at peace. He is politically correct and is shocked when Retief mentions the carapaces that the older Fustians has. He also pretends that he can hear the Fustians\u2019 music when he clearly isn\u2019t able to do so. Magnan is manipulative because he announces that Retief will sponsor SCARS even after Retief clearly tells him he is not interested. He misjudges character and refers to Slock as a fine young fellow when Slock is rude, violent, and mixed up in the scheme with the Groacis to begin conquering nearby worlds. At the end of the story when Magnan finally learns of the deceit of the young Fustians and the Groacis, he tries to act like he knew about it all along. His disinterest in anything not related to diplomacy gives Retief the leeway he needs to figure out the Fustian and Groaci crimes."

His pulped remains will be scoured up\nby the ramp-washers and mailed home in bottles!\"\n  \n \n  Retief whirled at a sound, caught up with the scuttling Yith fifty feet\naway, hauled him back to Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"It's up to you, Whonk,\" he said. \"I know how important ceremonial\nrevenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mercy!\" Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. \"I claim\ndiplomatic immunity!\"\n  \n \n  \"No diplomat am I,\" rumbled Whonk. \"Let me see; suppose I start with\none of those obscenely active eyes\u2014\" He reached....\n  \n \n  \"I have an idea,\" said Retief brightly. \"Do you suppose\u2014just this\nonce\u2014you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to\narrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" Whonk protested, \"those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one\nby one!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yess,\" hissed Yith, \"I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons\nof them, with the finest of equipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to feel him\nsquash beneath my bulk....\"\n  \n \n  \"Light as a whissle feather shall you dance,\" Yith whispered.\n\"Shell-less shall you spring in the joy of renewed youth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe just one eye,\" said Whonk grudgingly. \"That would leave him\nfour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be a sport,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Well.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a deal then,\" said Retief. \"Yith, on your word as a diplomat,\nan alien, a soft-back and a skunk, you'll set up the mission.

And I won't prefer charges of\ninterference in the internal affairs of a free world.\"\n  \n \n  Behind Whonk there was a movement.

For this one in truth owes me a\nvengeance.\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp\nand disappeared within the ship.\n  \n \n  \"I guess Whonk means business,\" he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp,\nall five eyes goggling. \"And he's a little too big for me to stop.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk reappeared, alone, climbed down.\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with him?\" said Retief. \"Tell him you were going to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We had best withdraw,\" said Whonk. \"The killing radius of the drive is\nfifty yards.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The controls are set for Groaci.

He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire\u2014\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too.

        "Summary_1": "Whonk is a very old Fustian who works as a clerk at the shipyards. He meets Retief when Retief comes to to inquire about seeing plans for the new passenger liner. Whonk is neutral and correct, but not especially friendly. His partnership, and it seems fair to say, friendship with Retief really begins when Retief returns to the shipyard to look for Whonk and finds that the Fustian thugs who tried and failed to kill him, due to his thick, mature skin and shell, have left him tied up, in an undignified position on his back.\nRetief apologizes for putting him in danger, and gets the old Fustian back on his feet. Whonk is so grateful that he tells Retief, \u201cMy cows are yours,\u201d a heartfelt, traditional Fustian expression of gratitude. \nWhonk is extremely angry about what the Fustian Slock and his gang have done to him, and throws in his lot with Retief. Thereafter, every time Retief is in physical danger from Fustians, Whonk is right there to help. \nAt the end of the story, Whonk steps in again to help Retief capture Yith, a member of the Groaci diplomatic mission, and Slock the rebel adult Fustian with no carapace. His desire for vengeance against these two nearly overwhelms his good sense. He puts Slock on the Moss Rose with the titanite that Slock had intended to use against Fustian politicians, and sets the rocket to blast off to Groaci, knowing that it would below up before it got there. \nBut Retief manages to settle him down enough not to take Yith apart piece by piece, by getting the Groaci to do something that would make Whonk\u2019s life a lot easier and more pleasant: surgically remove his carapace. \nWhonk is steadfast, reliable, implacable \u2013 a good sidekick for Retief.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Whonk is the older Fustian who helps Retief uncover the Groacian plot. He is looking after papers when Retief asks to see the plans of the new ship being built, but is hurt by the gang members and Youths that come in after Retief leaves. He is still willing to help Retief after this, and the two of them work together to piece together their evidence. Being older means that Whonk has a very heavy shell that keeps him from moving quickly, but he is very strong--he manages to capture a number of characters throughout the story to keep them from running away. Not only is Whonk the reason Retief was able to confirm that the new ship was indeed meant to be a battle cruiser, helping to uncover the plot, but the two of them become friends and go on a fishing trip together at the end of the story.",
        "Summary_3": "Whonk is an elderly Fustian who works managing documents at the shipyard where Retief goes to investigate the new passenger ship being built there. Whonk shares the documents with Retief, who notices its similarities to a defunct ship design that had been previously used in combat. Whonk educates Retief on the rebellious ways of the younger Fustians before they witness a Groaci military attache consulting with some youth outside his office. The youth attack Whonk after Retief\u2019s departure, nearly severing his head. When Retief returns to help him, Whonk is very grateful and continues to help Retief on his mission to discover the real connection between the Groaci and SCARS. Whonk guides Retief to the \u201cMoss Rock\u201d and helps Retief defeat yet another group of attacking youth. Whonk discovers that one of the youths is not a youth at all but rather an older Fustian with a detached shell. He is baffled by this. After a fracas at the sponsorship ceremony, Retief captures the Groaci attach\u00e9, and Whonk apprehends Slock, whom he quickly discovers is also an older Fustian with a surgically-removed shell. Retief convinces Whonk to forego his act of vengeance on the Groaci, and in exchange the Groaci would provide the elders of Fust with the same surgical procedure provided to the SCARS members. Pleased with this arrangement, Whonk agrees, but he is still seeking vengeance. He places Slock aboard the \u201cMoss Rock\u201d and sends it on a path to Groaci. The ship explodes on the way, killing Slock, and sending a message to the Groaci to stay away from Fust.",
        "Summary_4": "Whonk is an older Fustian who is very polite and helpful to Retief. He lets Retief look at the blueprints for the passenger ship that the younger Fustians are building with the Groacis and then apologizes for the rudeness of the younger Fustian who confronts Retief for looking at the plans. Whonk becomes Retief\u2019s ally right away; he holds off the younger Fustians who come back to confront Retief, giving Retief a chance to sneak out the back door. After two younger Fustians tell Retief they want his films from his pictures of the plans, he realizes they must have gotten the information about the pictures from Whonk and knew Whonk wouldn\u2019t have given it to them freely. When he checks on Whonk, he finds him tied up. The younger Fustians had tried to kill him. From then on, the two work together, checking the Moss Rock for explosives that have been removed from the storage area. When attackers come, Whonk protects Retief and blocks the attackers with his carapace. Whonk provides Retief with information that he needs to determine who is involved in criminal activity and what that criminal activity is. At the end of the story, he provides justice for Slock by putting him aboard the Moss Rock before it blows up so that he gets his just rewards. When everything settles, Whonk offers to take Retief on a fishing vacation."

        "Summary_1": "The story is set entirely on the planet Fust. The native inhabitants of Fust are described as something similar to snapping turtles that walk on their hind legs, and much of the imagery used by Fustians when speaking revolves around themes of the sea and mud. Fust is a peaceful enough world that they don\u2019t even really have much of a police force, despite the rowdy and rebellious behavior of Fustian youths. \nNot much is known about the physical characteristics of the planet, such as the proportion of sea and dry land. We know there must be oceans, because the warehouse where Wonk was tied up and left was full of bales of kelp, a sea product. The city of the story is also near a sea, whose breezes make it a bit cool at certain times of day.\nThe city where all the action takes place is an important city, perhaps the capitol. It is full of diplomatic missions from all planets, and is apparently a place of some Fustian learning and culture, given that it has musicians for hire. There is a space ship building operation right outside the city, which can be reached by public transport that consists of flat open wagons. This is practical for the unwieldy shape of the adult Fustian, if not too comfortable for a human.\nOne of the most interesting things about Fust, and the hardest for an outsider to understand, is their assorted suns and moons. Fust is lit by a blue sun called Alpha and a yellow sun known as Beta, and three moons orbit Fust. There is also a third sun, unnamed, so that there are three \u201cnoons\u201d on Fust.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story takes place on the planet whose native species is a turtle-like race known as the Fustians. It is usually a peaceful planet, and does not have a police force like humans are used to--in fact, weapons are currently illegal. There are at least two other species living here as well: the Terrestrials and the Groaci. More specifically, the story takes place near the coastline, with many events taking place either in political buildings or at the docks. The sea that lines this area has strong tides controlled by a number of celestial objects: there are three moons and multiple sons. The major sun is referred to as Beta, and is yellow, but there is a blue sun called Alpha as well. This has strong impacts on the weather as well: it can be very chilly while there are no suns in the sky, but very hot when the light is at its strongest. Besides the Terrestrial Embassy, its technical library, and the banquet hall, the protagonist Retief spends most of his time near the docks. At the port, he spends some time in the new ship being built where he asks Whonk to see the plans. He also does some investigation on the Moss Rock, the luxury ship where he found false evidence planted.",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on the planet Fust, where a chancery houses the Terrestrial Embassy where Retief works. Fust has several suns and moons that regulate the tides of the ocean nearby. The Fustians regularly nap There is a large city surrounded by shipyards, where Retief conducts the majority of his investigation into the development of the new passenger barge. When Retief meets Whonk, they pore over blueprints for the barge in Whonk\u2019s work hut and look out the window to see the Groaci attach\u00e9 consulting with the Fustian youth that had harassed them earlier. Later, a pair of youth attack Retief at the bus station, and he returns to the shipyard to inquire after Whonk. He enters the warehouse behind Whonk\u2019s shack and finds him injured in the midst of some hay bales. From there, Whonk and Retief go to the \u201cMoss Rock\u201d\u2014a ship where the Groaci barrels filled with titanite had been taken earlier\u2014to investigate. The \u201cMoss Rock\u201d is a luxurious ship dimly lit and meant for VIP guests. This is where Retief begins to uncover the plot of the Groaci to implicate SCARS in the ship\u2019s destruction. Retief then attends the sponsorship ceremony, which is held in a banquet hall with a low-ceiling. Fustian music plays, which is inaudible to the human ear. After Slock escapes the ceremony, Retief goes back to the \u201cMoss Rock\u201d, and this is where Whonk ultimately apprehends Slock once more.",
        "Summary_4": "The story's setting is in the future on a space world named Fust, inhabited by creatures who look similar to turtles.

Aliens come to Fust; Magnan and Retief work at the Terrestrial Embassy; the Groacis also have members on Fust. The planet has two suns: Beta, which is yellow, and Alpha, which is blue. There are also three moons. Part of the action in the story takes place in the Terrestrial Embassy. In contrast, other parts occur in the shipyard where the passenger ship is being built, its warehouse where Whonk is hidden after he is beaten, and where the explosive had been stored, aboard the barge the Moss Rock where the explosive has been moved and where Whonk puts Slock at the end of the story, and a low-ceiling banquet hall where the dinner is being held.

Corporal Bettijean Baker, his right-hand woman and new lover, picks up the phone one day, and then chaos ensues. \nA switchboard is put in the hallway to help receive the hundreds of calls being made to their office. This sudden influx of calls, attention, people, and disease leave the main characters feeling overwhelmed and desperate. \nSince the new lieutenant had not arrived (post Colonel Patterson\u2019s retirement), Sergeant Andy is effectively in charge as a noncom, though not everyone is happy about that. Andy pushes their worries aside, and continues working. \nDespite the spread, no fatalities have been reported, and infections are random. No trend has been established yet, but they are searching desperately for one. Bettijean goes through reports with Sergeant Andy, revealing all she\u2019s uncovered. It\u2019s affecting workers, artists, and poets, but not necessarily those who work in government, or as doctors or businessmen. The water systems are ruled out, as well as wind and food. Bettijean and Andy are left with nothing, except the possibility of biological terrorism. \nFinally, Andy orders Bettijean to halt all in-coming calls, and redirect their attention to all hospitals. \nDespite their best efforts, no conclusion can be reached. The colonel reappears in Andy\u2019s office, followed by two officers. He throws a newspaper down on his desk, proclaiming that this epidemic was allegedly caused by the Russians, and that all the authorities are baffled. It is hinted that the Colonel commissioned this article to throw doubt on Andy\u2019s authority. Andy defends his employees and the work they\u2019ve been doing. The Colonel forces Andy and Bettijean out of office, and Andy lets him, kissing Bettijean on the way out. Suddenly, the general walks in and gives Andy back his job, while telling him the news from Intelligence. The Iron Curtain\u2019s not sent word for almost two days. Only a coded message that could have been about the epidemic. \nAndy promises to work hard again, and the general assigns the colonel and his two men to the switchboard in the hall. After brainstorming about potential causes, Janis, another employee, enters the room and puts another stack of reports down. Small college towns, newly engaged girls, poets, all these people have been infected. Janis falls to the floor, and everyone rushes to her. She\u2019s been infected with the disease, and they question her about her activities for the past 12 hours. It\u2019s revealed finally that she wrote a letter to her mother, and Andy finally figures it out. The poison was in the stamps. He lets his higher-ups know, and Janis is carted off to safety.

It seems to be affecting only the United States of America, without affecting Canada even though it has reached Alaska. The dumbfounded officers decide to learn more about the people who have fallen sick. When Bettijean returned with more reports, two other officers came into Andy\u2019s office to show him the headlines: the public panic had started, two days after the office had stopped sleeping to find the root of the issue. The colonel doesn\u2019t appreciate the lack of military formality in the way that Andy and Bettijean are taking, and he angrily orders them to be disciplined before the general interrupts. The general gestures to Andy and Bettijean to continue their work, and sat down with them to talk solemnly. There\u2019s some suspicion about the Soviet Union\u2019s involvement. Recognizing Andy\u2019s need for manpower, the general assigns the very unhappy colonel to report to Andy and Bettijean for as long as the epidemic is going on. Lighting a new cigarette, Andy gets back to work. The team found evidence of small business workers being sick, but no government workers (outside of some in a hospital), no doctors, and no postal workers. They take this as evidence that it\u2019s not communicable, but they find some cities are more affected than others. Writers, poets, artists, and musicians in cities that are often vacation spots are hit hard, along with small college towns. They are interrupted by screams outside their door when Janis falls sick. When she\u2019s able to talk, Andy asks Janis questions about the past twelve hours. She had written and mailed a letter to her mother about the epidemic, but nothing else seemed out of place. Andy pondered over another cigarette as the doctor saw to Janis. Andy suddenly had an idea, frantically searched for Janis\u2019 purse, and handed one of her postage stamps to a lab technician. His hunch was right: the stamp was the problem, licking the glue was how people got sick. Andy starts on a plan to notify the public of the issue, and to investigate the source of the poison in the stamps. The lab was able to identify the toxin, and it would be simple to treat. The general took over giving orders, and gave Andy and Bettijean a month of furlough before marching the stamp out of the office as Andy and Bettijean looked at each other longingly. ",

As the day wears on, Andymust deal with threats to his operation from officers that believe that, as a noncommissioned officer, He is not qualified to perform his task regardless of his obvious expertise.\n\nVague trends begin to emerge.

        "Summary_4": "Sergeant Andrew McCloud is in charge of the office of Germ War Protection when a mysterious plague breaks out in the United States. His coworker Bettlejean tells him that all kinds of people are coming down with the illness, but no one has died yet. The strangest part about the new disease is that it has only affected Americans. Not even Canadians or Mexicans have become sick. \n\nMcCloud decides to send everyone who works in the office out to do some investigating about where the illness is coming from. He tells Bettlejean that the two of them will work in Washington. They begin to put together clues about the nature of the illness when suddenly a woman in the office, Janis, drops to the ground. She is red and feverish and extremely nervous. After some prodding, she admits that she broke an office rule when she mailed her mother a letter that included information about the outbreak. \n\nAfter a few moments of reflection, McCloud runs to Janis\u2019s office and tears through her drawers to find her stamps. He sends the lab technician to test them, but he is already convinced that the stamps contain poison, and they are behind the mysterious illness. \n\nWhen his superior comes in to ask him what he has discovered, McCloud divulges his beliefs about the problematic stamps. McCloud suggests that the President make an announcement to the public about the poisonous stamps. However, he quickly realizes that the stamps could have been tainted accidentally, and this doesn\u2019t necessarily point to an attack on the country. McCloud is interrupted by a phone call from the lab. The technician informs him that the illness the stamps cause has a quick fix, and the people who are ill are going to be just fine. McCloud allows someone else to take over. He\u2019s too tired and elated to make any more decisions. \n\nThe general offers McCloud and Bettlejean many awards and some time off to get to know each other better. He can tell that they are quite fond of each other. \n\n\n"

Andy theorizes that the replacement for the lieutenant got caught up in all the red tape, but, at the end of the day, the newly-coined Germ War Protection needed a leader. And Andy was stepping up to the job. \n\tHe had worked at the Office of the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Coordinator for two years prior to the epidemic. He knew the ins and outs of the place, so, despite being a noncom, he was truly the best for the job. \n\tOne of his colleagues, Corporal Bettijean Baker, had picked up the phone two days prior, and suddenly their whole words changed. An epidemic was sweeping the nation, infecting random people left and right with no underlying cause or trend, and, despite the absence of fatalities, panic was ensuing. Though some of the officers disapprove of Andy\u2019s noncom position, he continues working tirelessly with his colleagues to try and figure out the cause of this terrifying disease. \n\tHe and Corporal Bettijean Baker brainstorm throughout the story, desperately searching for a trend or place of infection. They realize that artists, poets, college students, and workers are the ones being infected; not necessarily doctors, dentists, and government employees. They try to figure out what activities each group does that could possibly have been the cause of their infection. They quickly rule out the disease traveling through water, wind, and food. And, later on, it\u2019s revealed that the disease is not contagious. Bettijean and Andy put their heads together and think. \n\tTheir time spent together brainstorming was also filled with flirtatious moments. Andy, with his freckles and messy hair, and Bettijean with her jet-black hair, share a kiss or two throughout the story. \n\tAfter exhausting themselves, Andy orders all the girls to redirect all calls to go out, not in. They are to focus on hospitals and relief crews, to discover more on who the virus is infecting. He and Bettijean are almost fired by the disgruntled colonel, who came with two replacements. Thankfully, just as Andy kisses Bettijean, the general walks in and dismisses the colonel. He reinstates Andy and Bettijean to their former and rightful positions, before telling them that the Iron Curtain has gone silent, except for one coded message from two days before, possibly hinting at the epidemic. \n\tAfter the brass left, Bettijean and Andy brainstormed some more, looking through new reports brought in by Janis, a colleague.

He is berated by some of his superior officers who couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of an officer not in a combat role being in charge of such a large issue, but pushed through and continued trying to work on a solution. He goes through piles of reports with Corporal Bettijean Baker, his assistant, trying to find something that connects the victims. The two of them work through a variety of emotions, including frustration, exhaustion, confusion, and exasperation. When the colonel comes back into Andy\u2019s office to yell more about the severity of the situation that he doesn\u2019t seem to think Andy is the right person to handle, Andy acknowledges him curtly, which makes the colonel relieve Andy of his duties. This whole time, Bettiejean is standing with him, gripping his shoulder in his defense. The threat doesn\u2019t stick, even though Andy was somewhat relieved to have a chance to sleep, as a captain walks in and tells him to continue working. The captain tells the colonel that he and his captains have to report to Andy for the remainder of the crisis. During each of these interactions with superior officers, Andy relies on smoking a cigarette to find some focus, and tries to listen to the captain\u2019s report about possible influence from the Soviet Union. He is upset, and in his exhaustion, loses hope for a moment as the general asks him what Andy can do about the situation, but then finds the courage to stand up and say that he\u2019ll get the job done as long as people work with him on it. He worked through more reports with Bettijean until they were interrupted by a scream as Janis, one of the office workers, fell sick at her desk. Andy called for a doctor and a chemist, asked Janis everything that had happened to her that day, and pondered over the new evidence over another cigarette. He has an epiphany, frantically looks for Janis\u2019 book of stamps in her purse, and sends a stamp with a lab technician. His hunch was right: the toxin that spreads the disease is on the adhesive side of the stamps. As he works on a response plan with the general, he calls out a few orders and then defers to the general to make the rest of the decisions in his exhaustion. The general then offers Andy and Bettiejean a month of furlough so that they can spend time with one another, and they look into each other\u2019s eyes excited to explore their connection. ",

The only clues that they can piece together are that the illness is affecting people who work in small offices rather than large buildings. They also recognize that artists and poets are becoming sick when doctors and dentists are not. \n\nMcCloud\u2019s subordinate, a woman named Janis, suddenly becomes ill. After he questions her about her day and activities, he realizes that the culprit behind the outbreak must be postage stamps. He locates one of the stamps that Janis had in her work desk and sends it to be tested in the lab. \n\nWhen his boss, the general, comes in to hear about McCloud\u2019s findings, he says with confidence that the postage stamps are behind the epidemic. When the lab confirms his suspicions, he is hailed as the hero.

Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal.

It is clear that the general has picked up on their attraction to one another when he suggests that they use their much deserved time off to get to know each other better. The two confirm that they will in fact be seeing more of each other when they hold hands at the news. \n\n"

        "Query": "How does Janis contribute to the discovery of the epidemic in THE PLAGUE?",
        "Article": "In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head.

He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later.

        "Summary_1": "In short, without Janis, Sergeant Andrew McCloud would not have discovered the cause of the epidemic as quickly or at all. \n\tNear the end of the story, Janis, an attractive blonde woman, enters Sergeant Andy\u2019s office to deliver another stack of reports before him and Corporal Bettijean. The two of them had been analyzing the reports and statistics for several hours now, desperate to find a trend amongst those infected. So far, they had come up with nothing concrete, except for the types of people who were getting infected. Working people, artists, poets, newly engaged women, and small office workers were all turning up sick. Bigger offices, postal workers, doctors, dentists, and government workers were all fine. So, what\u2019s the connection? \n\tAfter nervously delivering the reports, Janis quickly scurries out of the office and back to her desk elsewhere. Bettijean and Andy notice that the adult population in Aspen, Colorado; Taos; and Santa Fe, New Mexico is rapidly falling ill, all towns with prominent artistic industries. \n\tThey keep pouring over the reports, making new discoveries but still not coming up with any answers. Suddenly, a girl cries out from beyond his office. They hear a body fall to the floor, and they quickly rush out as the sounds of screaming emerge. Andy sends Bettijean to retrieve a doctor and a chemist, while he runs to help. Janis was lying on the floor, in pain and scared. Luckily, the virus is not contagious, so Andy and the others were able to help her. \n\tAndy interrogates her, asking detailed questions about her day and the past 12 hours. He tries to ascertain all the moments of her life, so he can pinpoint where and how she got infected. Her symptoms match up with the epidemic at hand (a fever and feeling dizzy), so Andy knows this is his best shot to find the origin. \n\tSlowly, she recounts her day and tells them all about what she did, where she was, and what she ate. She hides one thing though, which Andy quickly forces out of her. She wrote a letter to her mother, telling her about the epidemic and how scary it was. This is against regulations, as shown through Andy\u2019s grunt of disapproval. She mailed it with her own stamps, not with a government envelope. \n\tAndy puts all the puzzle pieces together in his mind and realizes that all those people, Janis included, had one thing in common: writing letters. The poison was in the stamp. Without Janis, Andy would have struggled far longer to discover the illness and halt the production and sale of all stamps nationwide. \n\t\n",
        "Summary_2": "Janis is the first person to fall sick with the mysterious disease in the Office of Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection. She had been one of the people delivering reports to Andy\u2019s office, and head seemed nervous when she had entered last. She had fallen at her desk, and was shivering and horrified at what had happened. Once she was able to talk with Andy, he was able to ask her questions about her day. This was important because Andy had not yet found a connection that tied the victims of the epidemic together. He insisted that he tell her everything, and the fact that she sent a letter to her mother was the crucial fact that allowed Andy to put the story together. He was able to have Janis\u2019 postage stamps tested for a toxin on the glued side, allowing him to finally find the root of the sickness and start the nationwide response, including giving the lab enough information to find out what was needed for a treatment. ",
        "Summary_3": "Janis is the phone operator who falls ill as they are working to solve the mystery of the pandemic. She becomes the key to unlocking the mystery as she describes her day to Andy. She informs him that she sent a letter to her mother earlier in the day. This, along with the trends that are becoming apparent in the sick populations allows Andy to deduce that licking stamp adhesive is what is making people sick.",
        "Summary_4": "Janis is the first person in McCloud\u2019s office to become sick. First, she comes in to give him a report, and she fidgets and moves like she is nervous. Only a few minutes later, she collapses in the hallway. She is feverish and dizzy. \n\nWhen McCloud pressures her to tell him everything that she has consumed and done in the last day or so, Janis admits that she broke government regulations when she mailed a letter to her mother that detailed the epidemic. McCloud points out that she hardly let out a secret. The news of the epidemic has spread far and wide at this point. \n\nHe contemplates her story for several minutes and realizes that in order to send the letter, Janis must have licked a stamp. Janis\u2019s illness turned out to be the essential clue. Without her explanation of the steps she took before she became sick, McCloud would not have the information he needed to solve the puzzle. \n"

        "Article": "And from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n  \n \n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general, I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n  \n \n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n  \n \n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n  \n \n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n  \n \n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report\u2014nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen\u2014not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had\u2014it was a\ncoded message the Reds'd tried to censor\u2014was an indication of\nsomething big in the works.\"\n  \n \n  \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had\nan epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n  \n \n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n  \n \n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n  \n \n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there.

Now, as I said before, let's\nget out of here and let these people work.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n  \n<doc-sep>It took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City.

One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR\nUNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN\nAUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.\n  \n \n  \"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE\nJET, \"what are you going to do now?

        "Summary_1": "From the start, the colonel does not approve of Sergeant Andrew McCloud. His gray eyes carry disapproval and irritation in them. As a member of the brass, the colonel strives for everything to be official and approved of, unlike the sergeant\u2019s recent promotion. The replacement for the retired colonel had not yet arrived, and the chicken colonel is not thrilled. To have a noncom, defined as a noncommissioned officer, in charge of this office while in the midst of a national epidemic is ludicrous, in his eyes. \n\tDespite voicing his doubts and grievances, Sergeant Andy is allowed to continue working as the head-of-office, at least for the time being. The colonel steals away and plots his next move. \n\tSeveral hours later, he returns, this time with two officers in tow. He walks into Sergeant Andy\u2019s office where he and Corporal Bettijean were looking through a stack of papers. With a defiant stride, the colonel tosses a newspaper onto the Sergeant\u2019s desk. Andy reads it and quickly throws it across the room. The article tells the tale of a red plague taking over America, a possible plot from Russia, and baffled government officials. The colonel brought in the article--and possibly helped write it--to convey the seriousness of the situation, but Andy takes it as an offense instead. \n\tHis colleague, Corporal Bettijean, defends Andy and reprimands the colonel at the same time. The captain behind him scolds her in return. After Sergeant Andy recites a list of excuses for his office, the colonel tells him that his insubordination will not be allowed. He calls for his removal, as well as Corporal Bettijean's, and promotes the two officers from the surgeon general\u2019s office to take their positions. \n\tAfter some fight, Andy relents and stands up, releasing himself of his duty. He kisses his colleague once, before she tries to fight back again. The general walks in and quickly demotes the colonel and his men to working at the switchboard, where the reader can assume they stay for the rest of the story. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Andy\u2019s first impression of the colonel (at least in terms of this story) is of the colonel whining about Andy being in charge, insistent that only officers in combat roles should be in charge of a situation as large as a nationwide epidemic. After Andy is able to work through some reports with Bettiejean, the colonel returns to throw a newspaper on Andy\u2019s desk to show the headlines, proving that the public panic has started. In this very tense encounter, the colonel continued to insist that Andy needed to understand the gravity of the situation, without recognizing that of course Andy knew that the issue was serious. He and a young captain overreacted to Bettiejean trying to calm the situation, citing insubordination, and the colonel tries to relieve Andy and Bettiejean of their duties before he is interrupted by a general. This general then assigns the colonel to report to Andy and Bettiejean for the remainder of the crisis, which makes the colonel even more upset. Near the end of the story, after the lab has a report about the toxin on the stamps, the colonel is already trying to take charge again. He reaches for Andy\u2019s phone to start making calls even though Andy is the one in charge of the office, and is the point-person for the epidemic. The colonel is again put in his place by his general, and is eventually sent out of the building with the rest of the officers.",
        "Summary_3": "The chicken colonel (slang for a full colonel--an officer with an eagle as an insignia) is an individual who is preoccupied with rank and traditional military chain-of-command formality. The fact that Andy is a noncommissioned officer operating without direct commissioned officer oversight is unacceptable to him.\n\nWhile the brigadier general sees Andy's expertise and places him in charge of the investigation, the chicken colonel immediately acts to try to undermine Andy's command. He arrives with two young officers to take over the Germ Protection Division but is stopped by an even higher ranking officer--the brigadier. The chicken colonel and his subordinates are assigned to work the phones in a humiliating defeat.",
        "Summary_4": "Chicken colonel comes into McCloud\u2019s office and demonstrates his dismay with McCloud\u2019s handling of the crisis thus far by slamming a newspaper on the desk.

Instead, he excuses them from their work to discipline them. \n\nHowever, he is swiftly interrupted by the general who insists that McCloud be in charge of the entire operation, regardless of his rank. He sends chicken colonel to man the phone lines with the rest of his staff. \n\nWhen McCloud announces that he believes American postage stamps have been poisoned, chicken colonel immediately picks up his phone and tries to take the lead once more.

        "Summary_1": "The story begins in a living room where a husband and wife sit in their respective chairs, the wife wearing a headset called a telovis. The husband, Herbert Hyrel, figures she is watching a sex-opera as her escapist entertainment of choice, and waits a few minutes to start his own entertainment. As we waits, he considers his anger towards his wife: he no longer resented the time she spent not talking to him, while utilizing her telovis, but he did hate that she controlled the purse-strings in the household and gave him a small allowance. His anger had been pent up for some time, enough that he wanted to kill his wife, but for now he was satisfied with the idea of killing her. Once enough time had passed, he flicked a switch on the teleporter suit he was wearing and a version of his body appeared in a cabin in the woods that he was renting, where he had left himself a fresh outfit. He headed to the Riverside Club where he hoped to encounter a woman he had met recently, and when he got there he sat down and drank some cheap whiskey. He encountered a costumed woman who teased him, pulled away to dance with someone else, but came back to dance with him once the man she was with disappeared.  This man had flipped the switch on his suit, disappearing and leaving behind a pile of clothes, presumably because he would have been discovered wherever his original body was. As Herbert danced and moved outside, he spotted the woman he had been looking for, wearing a suggestive costume and a platinum wig, her body and her purse all covered in jewels. She asked him for champagne, which he was upset about because he did not have much money, but he obliged and tried to move the night forward after he had had something to drink. Again, though, she requested he spend more money on her--this time, for a private room at the club so they did not have to be outside. She said she was asking him to prove to her that she could be spoiled, but this pressure reminded him how angry he was that he had to spend the little money he had trying to escape from his wife, budgeting in a way that limited his nights out just to have some privacy. He started yelling about how he would have more money soon, and eventually admitted that he would kill his wife to get it. Hearing this, the woman he was with pulled a gun out of her purse and shot him--it was his wife all along. The scene jumps back to the house, where the wife pulls off her telovis set, smugly turns off her husband's teleporter suit, and watches him gasp for air and die. She called the police to call for a doctor, hid her own teleporter suit, and waited for the police to show.",
        "Summary_2": "Herbert Hyrel finds himself in a loveless and difficult marriage. His wife has withdrawn herself, sticking to her televois or 3-D TV, and only gives him a monthly allowance. Her generational wealth makes him feel emasculated and weak, which only strengthens his hatred for her. Hyrel has recently invested in a teleporter suit, one that took him six months of saving to put the down payment on. This suit allows him to leave his corporeal body and travel to a shadow realm, where his conscious spirit can roam free. He uses this to drink, party, meet women, and escape from his wife and true reality. \nHe\u2019s looking forward to traveling again, because of the woman he met last time in the flapper outfit. He hopes that this night will be the night she gives herself to him. After soaking in the wonderful thoughts of murdering his wife--which he plans to do as soon as the thought no longer brings him joy--Hyrel flicks the switch on his teleporter suit and arrives naked in a small cabin. Quickly, he changes into his cheap satin suit and makes his way to Riverside Club by taking the bus and walking. Once there, he orders a bottle of cheap whiskey, thanks to his depleting funds, and watches the masked dancers around him. A woman in a Persian-themed costume kisses him on the cheek but leaves him for another man. That man suddenly disappears, leaving only his costume behind. Hyrel reveals that those who get hurt in the shadow realm carry the hurt back with them in the real world. For example, he cut his hand in Riverside Club, and the pain traveled with him, but not the scar. \nThe Persian dancer joins him again, and they start to leave the club. He\u2019s drawn to another woman the same from the night before. He swaps ladies and dances with her instead. She asks for champagne, which he reluctantly purchases. \nThey drink, and then he forces her out of the club. Feeling less-than, he forces himself on her, trying to kiss and grope her. She keeps asking him if he has enough money for her, where his private room is, and if he\u2019ll be coming back soon. This only emasculates him more and he soon explodes, telling her that he\u2019s going to kill his wife so he can finally have her money and do what he wants. \nThe flapper pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head and brain. She flicks the switch, and Mrs. Hyrel wakes up in her chair. She flicks the switch on Herbert, and he comes back in a vegetative state since his body brought back the pain, but not the scar. She calls the police, alibi in check, then removes and hides her teleporter suit. She puts on a pair of blue pajamas then meets the police at the door. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Herbert Hyrel is a man in an unhappy marriage who plots to murder his wife in order to be rid of her and inherit her money. Herbert despises the way his wife looks at him, and he imagines her denigrating him as a gold-digger with nothing to offer a woman, so he privately purchases a telporter suit--a thin, mesh body cover that can be worn under one's clothes and is used to transport the wearer's \"shadowy self\" to a receiver previously set in secret. While he believes his wife is watching a sex-opera using her telovis (a 3-D imaging device), Herbert engages the telporter and transports himself to a cabin situated between a highway and a river. There, he changes clothes and walks to the Riverside Club (a place where owners of telporter suits can gather to escape their dreary outer lives) where he plans to meet a girl he had met the previous night. Because telporting oneself is illegal, rooms at the club are very expensive in order to cover the costs of police protection and Herbert cannot afford a private room there with the allowance his wife gives him. The club is colorful and full of costumed, masked partyers, dancing together and drinking champagne. Herbert purchases a bottle of whiskey because he cannot afford the expensive champagne. As Herbert drinks, he becomes more relaxed and confident, and he watches a woman dressed in a Persian costume dancing with a man dressed as a bullfighter. Soon after, the bullfighter disappears, and Herbert is reminded that sometimes people at the club vanish suddenly when there is a threat they will be discovered in their outer lives. He also notices a scar on his hand and is reminded that when someone's shadow self is injured, their outer husk retains the feeling of pain but not the scar. Herbert dances with the Persian-costumed woman and becomes steadily more intoxicated by drink and by the atmosphere of revelry. Eventually, he finds the girl he had met the night before, recognizing her by her long, stockinged legs. She wears a platinum wig, a white mask, and green contact lenses, and they dance together and kiss. The drunker Herbert becomes, the more insecure he feels about his ability to satisfy the woman, and he begins lashing out at her, accidentally revealing his plans to kill his wife in order to take her money so he can start a new life with the mysterious woman. The woman laughs at him, and she withdraws a gun from her purse and shoots Herbert twice--once in the heart and then in the head. The woman is actually Mrs. Herbert Hyrel, and she has been using her own telporter suit to expose Herbert and dispose of him herself. Because Herbert\u2019s gunshot wounds do not transfer with his shadowy self back to his outer body, it appears as if Herbert simply died. Mrs. Herbert Hyrel calls the police, hides the telporter suits, and awaits their arrival.",
        "Summary_4": "Herbert Hyrel and his wife have an unhappy marriage. Herbert hates his wife and feels as if she thinks she is better than he is. She has money but only gives him a small allowance, and he resents her for this. She isn\u2019t fond of him either. Every night, she puts on her telovis for about three hours. Herbert thinks she is watching black-market sex-operas. Once she is caught up in the program, he uses his teleporter suit to escape to the Riverside Club. This is an exclusive club for people with teleporter suits, money, and a desire for self-abandonment. People go there to escape their boring, unpleasant lives and wear costumes to hide their identities while they engage in drunken, sexually-abandoned activities. Herbert has met a girl there and wants to see her again. He looks for her when he first arrives but doesn\u2019t see her, so he is interested in a Persian dancing girl who flirts with him. She is with a man dressed as a toreador. Herbert catches a glimpse of the scar on his hand where he had cut it at the club three weeks ago. In his unteleported body, he feels the pain of the cut but has no cut. \n\tLater in the evening, the toreador disappears from the dance floor, leaving behind a pool of his clothes. This means that he had to teleport back to his real life immediately; it is something that has happened many times at the club. Emboldened by his whiskey, Herbert moves in and embraces the Persian dancing girl. He draws her toward the exit to the gardens when he sees a long leg wearing a black mesh stocking protruding from a private booth. That is what the girl from the previous evening was wearing. He pulls the stockinged girl from the booth and dances with her. The stockinged girl is wearing a can-can dancer costume. She insists on having a glass of champagne before Herbert takes her outside. While she drinks, he worries that he won\u2019t be able to see her again until he gets his next allowance in two weeks and that she will find someone else in the meantime. He decides that he is going to kill his wife so he can have her money. When he tries to take the girl outside, she resists. She lets him know she wants him to have the money for a private room, show her a good time, and come see her often. He tells her he\u2019ll have plenty of money after tonight and that he will kill his wife to get it. The dancer pulls a gun from her purse and shoots him. \n\tMrs. Hyrel removes her telovis and pushes Herbert\u2019s teleport button to bring him back. His eyes open, and then he dies. She calls the police, saying something horrible has happened to her husband. Then she changes clothes, removing her teleporter suit, and hiding it behind a hidden door at the back of the medicine cabinet.\n"

        "Summary_1": "Herbert's wife controls the financial affairs in their household. She is a fan of her telovis set, her preferred medium for escapist entertainment, and Herbert is under the impression that she likes to watch sex-operas, which are a longer experience that rely on emotional build-up. She makes most of the money but also controls it all, which Herbert resents her for--he thinks she is keeping it from him, and feels looked down upon when she gives him his allowance. This infantilizing attitude makes him extremely angry. She is devious and cunning, and hatches a plan to catch him in his act. It is her, after all, that drove him to want to escape. Either to confirm suspicions of a murder plot or to disrupt his own escapist time, she has her own teleporter suit that she uses to position herself to seduce her husband in the one place he figured he would be free from her. She dresses up covered in jewels and insists that he spend money on her to pressure him to admitting that he has none, which eventually pushes him to admit his plan. She kills him once she hears this, and calmly puts everything back in order as she reports something being wrong with her husband to the police, clearly not upset that her husband is dead. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mrs. Herbert Hyrel is the daughter of a wealthy family. Although she and Herbert most likely originally married for love, their relationship quickly spiraled out of control and soon their disparity in wealth became a pressing issue. \nMrs. Hyrel withdrew herself from her husband once she felt that he was only with her for her money. She allotted him a monthly allowance, but that was all. Since Herbert was not the breadwinner, he felt emasculated and out of control in his own home. She is the instigator for his violent fantasies of killing her, and the woman that draws him back to Riverside Club. \nHer jewel-studded flapper dress that reveals her legs reveals her wealth and status at the Riverside Club. She wears green contacts and a platinum wig to further disguise herself from Herbert. Despite being married, he fails to recognize her, and, after tempting him and berating him, he reveals to her his plans to murder his wife. She then murders him in the shadow realm, killing his soul there but leaving his corporeal body intact in the real world. After traveling back to their home, Mrs. Herbert Hyrel supposedly gets away with the murder by pretending to be the doting wife concerned for her husband\u2019s health. She also has a rock-solid alibi with the televois and the fact that Hyrel was in an illegal teleporter suit. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Mrs. Herbert Hyrel is a strong, financially independent woman loathed by her husband because he feels she considers him less of a man because of his reliance upon her. At the beginning of the story, she wears a telovis--a device used to render 3-D images of remote performances in one's own living room. Herbert suspects she is using the device to watch a sex-opera, and that explains the slight smile on her face as he watches her. In reality, she is likely smiling because she is confident in her plan to catch Herbert at the Riverside Club and kill him there. Mrs. Hyrel provides Herbert a small allowance, which he saves up to purchase his own telporter suit, not knowing that she also has one. Mrs. Hyrel uses Herbert's tendency toward fantasy as an advantage in her plot against him. She takes on the persona of the mysterious woman, wearing a white mask, green contact lenses, and a platinum blonde wig. She seduces Herbert, and eventually kills him when he admits his plot to her.

Every night, she escapes from him when she puts on her telovis and watches shows for three hours. The night in the story, we learn that she actually teleports to the Riverside Club, too. At the club the night before, she met Herbert and flirted with him so much that he couldn\u2019t wait to see her again. When he goes to the club the night that the story takes place, he looks for her, finally finds her, and pulls her out of a booth to him. She wears a can-can dancer outfit that highlights her long legs. Herbert tries to take her outside immediately, but she insists on having champagne first. She drinks her champagne slowly while Herbert is anxious that he might have to teleport back. Herbert decides that he will go ahead and kill his wife, as he has been thinking about doing for quite some time. They dance, and then Herbert tries to pull her outside. Mrs. Hyrel asks if he doesn\u2019t have a private room he can take her to.

His wife seems to be fairly cold towards him, at least from the way she interacts with his death in the last scene of the story, but Herbert is harboring a large amount of hate and anger.

When she comes to the realization that he may only be with her because of her money, she starts to hide it from him and only gives him a monthly allowance. At that moment, Mrs. Hyrel took control and took most of Herbert\u2019s power away from him. \nIt\u2019s clear that Hyrel wants to be the man of the relationship or the one that wears the pants. So this action made him feel weak and unimportant. This further aggravated their marriage and led to a build-up of long-term resentment. \nMrs. Hyrel practically ignores Herbert, spending her evenings watching the televois. She doesn\u2019t want to be bothered during this time either, since it would ruin the show. It\u2019s later revealed that she also has a teleporter suit, so she may have been in the Riverside Club in other instances, not just watching the televois.

        "Summary_3": "The story never shows the Hyrels communicating outside of their shadowy selves; this emphasizes their dysfunction as a couple and highlights their mutual disdain. Herbert thinks his wife hates him because she believes he married her for her money, and he lives off the allowances she gives him. In turn, Herbert feels emasculated, and blames this on her, despite the fact that he does nothing but take her money and use it to attempt to seduce women at the Riverside Club. Herbert compares the thought of killing his wife to a bottle of old wine; the longer one marvels at a nice, expensive bottle of wine, the better it tastes when one finally drinks it. In the same way, he relishes his scheme, almost becoming intoxicated by it. When Herbert reunites with the woman at the Riverside Club, he cannot stop worrying that his wife will remove her telovis and discover him, and he continuously obsesses over his plan with increasing urgency. Herbert is so blinded by his rage and insecurities, that he fails to realize the woman is actually Mrs. Hyrel in disguise. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Hyrels have an unhappy marriage. In the evenings, they escape from each other, Mrs. Hyrel to her telovis shows and he to the Riverside Club. Herbert first resented Mrs. Hyrel\u2019s hours-long escape each night that left him lonely in the evenings, but then he gets his teleporter suit and can\u2019t wait for her to get wrapped up in her shows so that he can escape to the club. His resentment of his wife grew into hatred. Herbert does not have money of his own; his wife has money and gives him a \u201cpaltry\u201d allowance as if he were a child. She seems to resent him, too, because he thinks she feels like she got a bad deal in marrying him and that she was trapped into marrying him without knowing what he was really like. Herbert has been thinking of killing his wife for some time, but he doesn\u2019t want to do it right away because thinking about it is like the anticipation of enjoying an old bottle of wine. As long as the bottle is there, he can enjoy the hope of drinking it just as he can enjoy the hope of killing his wife. Even in her altered identity as the can-can dancer at the club, Mrs. Hyrel treats Herbert as inferior. She refuses to let him take her outside until he has bought her a glass of champagne; then she makes him wait a long time while she sips it. When he finally does take her outside, she refuses to do what he wants unless he can show her he has the money for a private room and to entertain her properly. Mrs. Hyrel knows that this will frustrate him even more and probably suspected that he wanted to kill her. In any case, she has planned to kill him because she brought her gun with her. When he states that he will kill his wife to have the money to entertain the girl, Mrs. Hyrel promptly shoots him. Her plan is well-thought-out because she has a hidden back to her medicine cabinet where she hides her teleporter suit before the police come. This hidden compartment has allowed her to keep her visits to the Riverside Club from Herbert and will prevent the police from suspecting her role in Herbert\u2019s death.\n\n"

        "Summary_1": "Teleporter suits play an important role in the relationship of Herbert and his wife, but also in the society that they live in more broadly. In terms of broad significance, the teleporter suits are important to the Riverside Club, as only people who own one are allowed to enter. They are illegal to own, so the club had to be careful about who they let in. Even though they are frowned upon, it seems they are a popular purchase for those who can afford them. Both Herbert and his wife own one, though we don't learn that his wife has one until the end of the story. For Herbert, the teleporter suit is his ticket to spend time outside of the house that he feels trapped in, in a relationship that he is not happy in. It allows him to visit this club and meet other people. At the same time, it is these suits that allowed his wife to follow him to the club and convince him to admit his plans, eventually ending in his death. After she shoots him, she hides her own suit but leaves his on his person. Because the body in the suit and the other copy of the body experience things differently, it was a sneaky way to kill her husband. ",
        "Summary_2": "Teleporter suits are an illegal yet highly sought-after and expensive tech gadget in this society. With this suit, the wearer can be transported to another realm, while their body remains in place. Their souls can have fun, dance the night away, drink as much as they want, and their partners or families will never know. The next morning, however, when they return to their corporeal body, they will carry last night\u2019s hangover with them to the physical realm. \nThe teleporter suit allows Herbert Hyrel to escape his suffocating household and relish in his manly and sexual fantasies. He wants to prove himself to society and to brand himself as something he is not. In this other world, he can pretend to be a much richer, more powerful man. His rich wife makes him feel insignificant, so he takes his troubles to the shadow realm. \nThe teleporter suits allow the wearer to travel between realms, but a connection between the shadow self and body remains. Whatever happens to the shadow self, will also happen to the corporeal self, only the physical or visual element will not be there. So, if someone were to get hurt in the shadow realm, their physical body would feel the pain but would not bear the scars. \nThis allows Mrs. Herbert Hyrel to murder her husband in the shadow realm, and return to the physical world without blood or any incriminating evidence. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The telporter suits catalyze the major conflict in the story. In one sense, Herbert's telporter suit represents his ability to escape what he considers to be an emasculating, oppressive marriage. On the other hand, Mrs. Hyrel's secret telporter suit leads to Herbert's eventual demise. The suits are made of a thin mesh that fits the body like a stocking and can be worn underneath one's clothes. The telporter can be engaged by flicking a small switch, and it sends its wearer to a receiver at a previously-set location. Herbert installs his receiver at a small cabin in the woods a short distance away from the Riverside Club since he cannot afford the private rooms there. Herbert does not understand the mechanics behind the suit, but he grasps its basic function--the suits transport a person's \"shadowy self\" from one's body and the body is left in \"a conscious but dream-like state.\" When the shadowy self returns, the body does not retain any scars the shadowy self may have sustained but it does feel the pain of those injuries. Self-telportation is also illegal, although the Riverside Club maintains police protection by charging high prices and paying them off. Mrs. Hyrel uses to her advantage when she foils Herbert's plans to kill her and instead kills him and makes it appear as if he simply died while engaging in illegal activity.",
        "Summary_4": "\n\tThe teleporter suits provide people with a means of escape from their boring or unpleasant lives. Many people have them and use them to go to the Riverside Club where they can abandon their lives and live for the pleasure of the moment without anyone knowing who they are since everyone there wears costumes and masks. In addition, self-teleportation is illegal, so no one wants anyone else to know they have teleportation suits. When people use their teleporter suits, their real bodies stay where they are in reality while their \u201cshadow\u201d bodies travel to another place. People who teleport to the Riverside Club can do anything they want without their spouses or anyone else knowing what they are doing. Meanwhile, since their real bodies remain in \u201creal life,\u201d it looks as if the person is still there, doing nothing out of the ordinary that can draw suspicion or blame from anyone who knows them. \n"

Everyone who goes there is looking to escape themselves, but ironically Herbert escapes his wife to end up right back in front of her. Besides being a point of interest because it offered the clearest path of escape for Herbert, the club is also important because it shows glimpses into how the suits work: when someone has to leave suddenly, their clothes are left behind because it is just the copy of the body that moves. The club also was significant to the story because it provided a place for Herbert's wife to play out her plan to catch Herbert in his own plot.",

It caters to the wealthy, giving them a place to escape the troubles and rules of the corporeal world and loosen up with ample drinks and scantily-clad people. The Riverside Club creates a fantasy for people to run away to, a dreamworld where cheating isn\u2019t bad, where over-drinking is normal, and where people can be whoever they want to be. \nIn the case of Mr. Herbert Hyrel, he travels to the Riverside Club to make himself feel like more of the man he wants to be. He goes there to pick up women, prove to them that he\u2019s worth something, as well as prove that same sentiment to himself. His rich wife no longer shares her money nor her time with him, which only further emasculates him. He travels to the Riverside Club in search of fantasy and other women.

        "Summary_3": "The Riverside Club is a social club where revelers can self-telport in order to escape their outer lives and dress in lavish costumes, drink champagne, and dance and sleep together in private rooms. The club has a large main room softly lit by intermingling, colored lights. People dance on the dance floor in this room and dine and drink together at tables surrounding it. There are also private rooms and booths hidden within the walls surrounding the main room. Near the exit stands a clump of artificial palm trees which leads outside to a garden where Herbert attempts to drag the mysterious woman when they are dancing together, presumably for a sexual encounter. Herbert wants to go outside because he cannot afford a private room, and when the mysterious woman insists they wait until he can afford one, Herbert explodes in a rage and reveals his plot to kill his wife. The club is quite expensive for practical purposes--since self-telportation is illegal, they need to charge enough to cover the cost of paying off the police. The Riverside Club represents Herbert's physical and mental retreat from his miserable life and is also the environment that ultimately leads to his death.",
        "Summary_4": "The Riverside Club is an exclusive club for people with money who want to live out their fantasies without other people knowing who they are or what they are doing. The club requires its members to have money, a desire for self-abandonment, and a teleporter suit; it encourages people to act without society\u2019s limitations on its citizens. It offers alcoholic beverages, private booths and rooms, and places outdoors where couples can engage in any activity they want. The club\u2019s atmosphere is happy, fun, and exotic with altering lights, music, drinks, and dancing. It offers people the opportunity to remain physically present in their acceptable roles while escaping those roles in private. Because their real identities are hidden, people can act in ways that are uncharacteristic to them, with unpopular people becoming popular, depressed people becoming cheerful, and inferior-feeling men becoming \u201call-conquering males.\u201d \n\tIn the story, the Riverside Club is significant because it is the escape that Herbert and his wife both turn to, enabling them to act out their fantasies away from each other. However, it is ironic that the girl Herbert meets and can\u2019t wait to see again is his wife. She, however, knows who Herbert is since she is prepared and has a gun and kills him when he says he is going to murder his wife. Mrs. Hryel seems to have been going to the club to ultimately get rid of Herbert and enjoy herself since she is in a private booth with someone else when he finds her. It also seems that she has had \u201centertainment\u201d with other men because she tells him, \u201cA girl doesn\u2019t like to be taken outside,\u201d and Herbert interprets this as meaning she has had assignations with other men, but those men all had private rooms. \n"

        "Summary_1": "The story starts in a park, where we meet a a young boy who goes by the Butcher (\"Butch\"), and his dog Brute. The boy is trying to do something to the dog with a small metal tube when Hal, another boy, shows up with his own dogs, and another boy named Joggy. It turns out these are not normal dogs, but are \"uninj\", machines created to be like dogs but not able to be hurt. Butch seems bored with these countermeasures against violence, and intent on putting violence back in the world. His interactions with Hal show us that they live in a civilization where the children are given opportunities to work out any violent and angry tendencies or impulses before they are conditioned as adults. They are only allowed to visit the Time Theater to see glimpses into other societies (and thus evidence of violence) after age five, and the change in mentality happens at age six. Butch wants to use Time Bubble to travel through time, but Hal insists that this is impossible. The boys head to this theater, an incredible crystal building with an important place in this society, choosing to fly there with their hover technology. Joggy is five, so he is allowed to enter with Hal, but Butch is blocked from entering by the ushers, which Hal says is for his own protection. Joggy and Hal take a seat in a children's viewing area to look into the glowing orb of light that sits in the middle of the round theater. The orb acts as a viewport into various times and places, and is currently showing a view of Earth, Scandanavia more specifically, around year zero according to Earth calendars. There are a number of warriors in the forest scene, along with some dogs and a sorcerer, and the boys watch in earnest. As the electronic interpreter for the viewing gives the boys more information about cultural context, Butch manages to sneak in to the theater by lying to the ushers. Shortly after Butch and two young girls join the viewing, something happened that no-one thought possible: the sorcerer pushed one of the warriors through the orb of the Time Bubble, throwing him into the theater. Panic falls on the audience, and warriors and dogs continue to enter the theater as Butch and the uninjes start to fight off the time-travelers with their design keeping them from being injured. Hal is convinced that this happened because an under-five (Butch specifically) was in the theater, but the rest of the public does not know he is young and they thank him for saving the day as he fights off the warriors and the Time Bubble collapses. This is the first piece of chaos the adults have experienced in their adult lives, and the Butcher is content with how it all played out, getting to play hero in a violent setting for a day with Brute.",

He tells his friends, Joggy and Hal that he wishes he lived like Huckleberry Finn, with the ability to get dirty and inflict pain.\n\nButch says that one day he will be the World Director, and he will bring back war. Hal, who is older and more mature, explains that Butch\u2019s desire for violence will be conditioned out of him once he turns six. He says that Butch will understand everything once he\u2019s allowed in the Time Theater to see into the past. \n\nHal and Joggy decide to go to the Time Theater.

Butch is rough with Brute, jabbing and poking him hard with a metal tube, but his friends Joggy and Hal come along and we learn uninjes cannot be harmed nor can they harm. They have been programmed against it. This is just one element in a post-violence world; adults have been systemically programmed against using violence to resolve conflicts between themselves, although they may use it to fight against alien enemies. Butch, however, insists his friends call him \"Butcher\" because he wants to become a dictator when he is older and bring back violence as a means of conflict resolution. His friend Hal assures him that when he is older, he will understand why removing violence from society was \"Man's greatest achievement.\" The boys make their way to the Time Theater at the end of the Avenue of Wisdom by utilizing levitators that help them swim through the air. The Time Theater is home to a large bubble that functions as a one-way viewer into pre-civilization eras. Only people over five years old are allowed into the Time Theater; the Butcher is stopped by an invisible \"usher\", leaving Hal and Joggy to enter the viewing cubicle alone. Once inside, the bubble interpreter and Hal explain to Joggy how the bubble functions. It is essentially a time-hole that allows observation because of light isotopes that leak through. But matter cannot pass through the bubble, which is why it cannot be used for time travel. However, some scientists theorize that people with impulsive minds, such as underage children, might activate a time-traveling capability. The Butcher tricks an adult into carrying him into the Time Theater, and he joins Joggy and Hal in their viewing of a group of barbaric Scandinavian men from the Dawn Era. They watch as a sorcerer conducts some kind of spell with the Butcher egging him on. The Butcher's impulsive behavior combined with the sorcerer's ability to see into the future unlocks the bubble, and the sorcerer pushes the Scandinavian men through into the Time Theater. There, they begin to attack the adults present and attempt to kidnap a woman in the audience. The Butcher commands the uninjes to attack the men, and he stuns them with his use of the levitator to protect his head from the blows of their swords. The uninjes push the men back through the bubble, where they kill the sorcerer and the interpreter closes the bubble. Its automatic safeguards have failed, and the Butcher has saved the day."

Hal is confident in his knowledge of the world and society and does not get frustrated with Butch\u2019s fantastical ideas. \n\nHal enjoys his trips to the Time Theater and it\u2019s his suggestion that convinces Joggy and Butch to go see the Time Bubble. He thinks that the Scandinavian warriors sound interesting. He agrees that Butch should walk him and Joggy there, but he is certain that Butch will not be allowed into the theater. Hal is convinced that an usher will stop Butch from entering, and he believes that allowing someone under the age of five to enter the sacred hall could be dangerous. \n\nHal tries to answer all of Joggy\u2019s questions about the Time Bubble, but the truth is he doesn\u2019t understand a lot of the mechanisms behind the mysterious machine. He is a little bit embarrassed when the interpreter has to keep responding to Joggy throughout the show. Hal is truly alarmed when Butch shows up unexpectedly in the transparent cubicle. He thinks it is immoral and wrong to convince the usher that he is older than he truly is, and he worries that there will be severe consequences for his actions. When the Scandinavian warrior comes out of the Time Bubble and becomes violent, Hal immediately blames Butch for the glitch. He is a rule follower, and regardless of the fact that Butch saved the day, he remains upset and angry at him for breaking protocol in the first place. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Hal is an older boy in the story, and he likes to remind his younger friends of his age and wisdom. He is more mature and sees the reasoning behind a lot of the rules that frustrate Butch, but his constant refrain of telling Butch that he\u2019ll feel differently when he\u2019s older only serves to irritate the younger boy and make him want to act out even more. Hal tells Butch that it\u2019s dangerous for under-fives to be in the Time Room, and he grows increasingly frustrated with and anxious about Butch\u2019s behavior when he lies his way in and starts messing with the Time Bubble. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Hal is the oldest of the three friends, and he seems to understand the most about how the Time Theater functions and how the bubble works. Whereas Butch is impulsive, impatient, and wants to use violence to solve problems, Hal is more adjusted to the standards of the post-violence society. He offers wise counsel to Butch, who resists him at every turn, and he educates Joggy, who is more eager to absorb the lessons he imparts. Hal contrasts pre-civilization with the current world they live in and suggests that with age, Butch will also understand the necessity of removing violence from the equation when it comes to resolving conflict.

        "Summary_1": "There are two major types of technology highlighted in the story: the first is the mechanical kind that allows for hovering travel, the development of uninjes, and the systems in place in the theater like the ushers and the protective mechanisms. The other major thing that could be categorized as technology is the Time Bubble itself; it acts as a form of entertainment but also as a warning to avoid the habits of people of the past. Focusing on the engineering technology that does not directly relate to potential time-travel, it is strongly hinted that the children in the story might be partly mechanical themselves, though this is not clarified. It is pointed out that there are \"adolescers\" and \"kinderobots\", which could be referring to the age groups of these children, and the dogs that follow the people around are also technological creations. The \"uninjes\" are like dogs, and are built to have canine reactions to be as close to real dogs as possible, but cannot be harmed and in the end are still collections of circuits with a battery and molded plastic. There are a number of pieces of technology in the theater, including forcefields used by ushers to block children who are too young to enter, and a number of safeguards like forcefields to protect people inc ase something went wrong with the Time Bubble. The bubble itself is a marvel of technology but nobody understands exactly how it works. Most of the discourse surrounding this is about the theories of time travel. ",
        "Summary_2": "The technology in this world helps the children and people from getting injured. The boys use metal harnesses, levitators, and the hemisphere repulsor to keep them from hitting their bodies against trees, the ground, walls, or anything else that could potentially inflict pain. These technologies create an invisible shield around them and gently bounce them away from objects. \n\nThe Time Theater is a very important place that houses the society\u2019s Time Bubble, their most prized possession. It allows the adults to feel like gods because they are able to look back at any time or place and recognize how much their society has improved from simpler times. Upon entering the theater, Hal and Joggy feel a shock of electricity. Butch, however, is repelled by an invisible wall that knows he is not yet of age to enter the sacred space. There is also technology to keep the children separated from the adults in the theater. \n \nThe electronic interpreter in the theater helps the audience members understand what it is they\u2019re seeing and how the machine works. It is capable of hearing the audience members\u2019 questions and it quickly provides answers. \nThe Time Bubble is supposed to keep everything, even light, from entering the theater. It is only supposed to give viewers a look into the past, not a real experience. Some scientists in the society believe that the Time Bubble uses real peoples\u2019 memories to time travel. The Time Bubble malfunctions and allows the Scandinavian warriors in the Bubble to enter the theater. The men from the past are shocked when they see that Butch is protected by an invisible shield and the uninjes are incapable of being injured the way real dogs would. \nThe society\u2019s new technology saves the audience members\u2019 lives from a real attack from people of the past. Even when their technology malfunctions, they are able to protect themselves from the swords and wolvish dogs. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Technology is a huge part of this society, as it prevents bloodshed and is central to their way of life. Hal mentions fear houses and death games, as well as the invincible robot dogs known as uninjs. He explains that over time humans have been conditioned to reject violence. He also mentions a Space Fleet that they rely on in case of an outside attack. This society has also created a setting that is difficult or impossible to tarnish or disrupt. The children use levitators to \u201cswim\u201d through the air, and the Time Bubble is used as a source of historical exposure (and possibly propaganda). Until Butch is able to use the Time Bubble for actual space travel, the primary role of technology in this society seems to be to maintain peace, pleasantness, and control. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Technology plays an important role in the story, particularly as a buffer against violence in the new civilization as well as a window into the pre-civilization era. The boys use special levitation devices to swim through the air; these devices also release a kind of repulsor shield that protects them from running into things while they're swimming such as trees. The Butcher later utilizes this technology to protect himself against the sword attacks of the Scandinavian men when they are pushed through the bubble into the Time Theater. The uninjes are robotic canines that cannot be hurt and are programmed against hurting humans themselves. However, they also protect the humans against the attacks of the Scandinavian men later in the story. The Time Theater utilizes time-hole technology to open windows into previous eras for observation and study, and the interpreter intuits viewers' questions and answers them in real-time. The \"usher\" is a kind of force field as well, which has the ability to determine a person's age as they attempt to pass through it. All of this technology is imperfect, and, as the Butcher later demonstrates, malleable if in the hands of someone with impulsive instincts."

We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside.

I should have killed you outright.\"\n  \n \n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n  \n \n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n  \n \n  \"What about the book?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n   \n   kind\n   \n  of book?

For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\n  \n \n  The old man raised the gun.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  There was a knock.\n  \n \n  Betty bounced up with Olympic\nagility and had the door swinging\nwide before the knocking was quite\ncompleted.\n  \n \n  He was old, little and had bug\neyes behind pince-nez glasses.

Your ad\nin the phone book says you'll investigate\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only\none exception.\"\n  \n \n  \"Excellent. Do you believe in time\ntravel?\"\n  \n \n  Simon said nothing. Across the\nroom, where she had resumed her\nseat, Betty cleared her throat. When\nSimon continued to say nothing she\nventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, why?\"\n  \n \n  Betty looked to her boss for assistance.\nNone was forthcoming. There\nought to be some very quick, positive,\ndefinite answer. She said, \"Well,\nfor one thing, paradox.

Then how\ncould you ever be born?\"\n  \n \n  \"Confound it if I know,\" the little\nfellow growled. \"How?\"\n  \n \n  Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,\nwhat you wanted to see me about.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to hire you to hunt me up\nsome time travelers,\" the old boy\nsaid.\n  \n \n  Betty was too far in now to maintain\nher proper role of silent secretary.\n\"Time travelers,\" she said, not\nvery intelligently.\n  \n \n  The potential client sat more erect,\nobviously with intent to hold the\nfloor for a time. He removed the\npince-nez glasses and pointed them\nat Betty. He said, \"Have you read\nmuch science fiction, Miss?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Then you'll realize that there are\na dozen explanations of the paradoxes\nof time travel.

Mr. Oyster, if the\nfuture has developed time travel why\ndon't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n  \n \n  Simon put in a word. \"The usual\nexplanation, Betty, is that they can't\nafford to allow the space-time continuum\ntrack to be altered. If, say, a\ntime traveler returned to a period of\ntwenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,\nthen all subsequent history would be\nchanged. In that case, the time traveler\nhimself might never be born. They\nhave to tread mighty carefully.\"\n  \n \n  Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't\nexpect you to be so well informed\non the subject, young man.\"\n  \n \n  Simon shrugged and fumbled\nagain with the aspirin bottle.\n ",
        "Summary_1": "This society is organized around a reconditioning of thoughts that happens as children transition into adulthood, starting at age six. Adults who have already been reconditioned are passive and polite members of society, who supposedly do not have traces of violent tendencies anymore. Before this, however, there are a few levels of separation from the rest of the society. Five year olds are allowed to go to the Time Theater to view whatever is showing through the Time Bubble, a view into other societies throughout time, but anyone younger than five is not allowed. This is presumably because of safety concerns--Hal thinks that young children are a nuisance to adults in these settings. The society has a number of systems in place specifically for these younger children who have not yet been conditioned. There are things called death games and fear houses, which we do not see details of in this story, that are meant to clear out the childrens' emotional space. It also seems that uninjes, the robotic dogs that the boys have, are also for this purpose: Hal says that they are part of the society's options for letting kids work out their ruthless and inconsiderate impulses. These impulses are restructured when they are aimed at other people, but violent alien beings and viruses or other medical concerns are still considered threats worth responding to in full force. The particular focus on avoiding violent patterns seen in other civilizations is highlighted by the grand nature of the Time Theater, and its position at the end of a major street in a large public park.",

The society\u2019s dogs, uninjes, are programmed not to bite or hurt the people, even when they are hit or stabbed themselves. They do not react like normal canines. \n\nYoung children are considered to be self-centered and ruthless, and they are provided with death games and fear houses to get out their emotions and prepare to be conditioned as adults. When children turn six years old, they feel differently than they did before. They are ready to enter the Time Theater and view the Time Bubble. They are taught about pre-civilization and the important differences between their own society and the past. They learn how to reject violent solutions to problems and live in peace. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The structure of society is based on age, and very specific behaviors are allowed and prohibited at different ages. Very young children are allowed to play and get dirty, but after a certain age they are no longer allowed to do so. Certain ages are considered too young for certain ideas, and aren\u2019t allowed in the Time Building or are only allowed in certain parts of it. Younger children are sometimes called \u201ccubs\u201d, and it seems to be commonplace for older members of society to treat younger members with sweet derision. This society puts a strong emphasis on maturity and carefully controls what people are allowed to do at what ages and when they are allowed to learn concepts or do activities. The core principle is nonviolence but the results are near-total uniformity and strict constraints. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The society the main characters inhabit is post-violence. While children below five are given uninjes, death games, and fear houses in order to clear their emotions, adults are systematically re-programmed to believe that violence has no place in this new society. While violence is never used to resolve conflicts between humans, the Space Fleet will still use violence in defense against alien enemies. There are a number of protections in place to prevent violence upon humans from repulsor shields to the protective uninjes. The bubble at the Time Theater offers adults and those with the appropriate mental facilities a view into the pre-civilization world so that they may learn from the past and understand why a lack of violence became necessary in the new society."

He is described this way again at the end of the story when he is shouting battle orders. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Pre-civilization primarily refers to the time before the post-violent society where the central action of the story takes place. They are able to view this era by using the time-hole technology of the bubble on display at the Time Theater in the Peace Park at the end of the Avenue of Wisdom. \"Pre-civilization\" is characterized by famous historical figures such as Hitler, Stalin, and Tamerlane--individuals that the Butcher idealizes for their use of violence in resolving conflict. The climax of the story revolves around a viewing of Scandinavian men of the Dawn Era gone wrong when the simultaneous workings of a sorcerer and the Butcher's impulsive mind allow the Scandinavian men to pass through the bubble into the Time Theater. The ensuing battle highlights the barbarism of the Dawn Era--they use swords and real dogs in battle; it also demonstrates the Butcher's ability to weaponize technology meant to oppose violence as a way to protect this new society."

The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\n  \n \n  Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away.

        "Summary_1": "It\u2019s the year 819, and a man named Ryd Randl who lives in Dynamopolis, a city in North America, goes to a dive bar. The place is crowded with many men because Dynamopolis is experiencing a power shortage, and they would freeze outside. Burshis, the owner of the bar, gives Ryd a free drink and explains that a ship from Mars just brought power back. He is expecting there to be a big boom in the economy soon, which will lead to jobs for people like Ryd. Ryd is not easily convinced of this good news. \nThe ugly and tall man sitting next to Ryd recognizes him. Once outside, Mury introduces himself and asks Ryd if he wants to make some money. He explains that he can offer Ryd a comeback. Ryd has been jobless for ten years, but before that he was a helio operator. Since then, Mars has become fully independent, and all the work moved there. Mury says that he is working for the hundreds of men who have been put out by the corrupt government on Mars. Although Ryd and all the other Earthmen have been told that the new power cylinder being installed will create jobs and bring back the power, Mury argues that isn\u2019t truly the case. He insists that Earthmen are essentially slaves to Mars\u2019s landowners, and in order to stop that from happening, they must stop the power cylinder from landing on Earth. \nThe two men arrive at Pi Mesa, and Mury kills a guard. Ryd steals his clothing and his flame pistol so that they can get on the ship unnoticed. Ryd must pretend to be a guard escorting Mury, the Poligerent of Dynamopolis aboard the Shahrazad. The two men sneak into the controlled area through a metal door, make it to the Communications Tower, and speak with a guard. Mury offers to show his credentials as Poligerent, and surprises the guard with a punch to the gut. Mury takes the officer\u2019s gun, points it at him, and demands he accompany them. \n\nRyd nervously points his flame pistol at the guard and drops his weapon. The weapon goes off and its flame hits some machinery. This gives the pilot pause, and Mury hurries to the control room and takes over the situation. There are three workers there who become his hostages. He explains to the men that he\u2019s taking Shahrazad into space to meet the power shell. \n\nWhen the ship takes off, Ryd passes out from the pressure of the acceleration. When he wakes, Mury assures him that they are on the right path, somewhere near the orbit of the Moon. However, Mury quickly finds out that his masterful plan has been foiled when one of his prisoners, the astrogator, informs him that a ship named the Alboroak is approaching, and it\u2019s about to intercept them. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with the landing of a Martian ship on Earth, where electrical power has reached a critical shortage. The Martian ship reportedly carries a power cylinder that will restore power on Earth, enabling businesses to reopen and people to regain their jobs. Ryd Randl sees the ship landing just before he enters the Burshis\u2019 Stumble Inn which has power and where many men are staying to keep from freezing to death outside. Ryd lost his job ten years ago, and apparently, he has asked for loans from many people in the bar because they will not look him in the eye. The bar owner gives him a free drink but refuses to offer him a loan if Ryd asks him for one. A stranger approaches Ryd and seems to know, although Ryd does not know the stranger. The stranger asks Ryd to step outside with him and offers Ryd a way to make money. The stranger\u2019s name is Mury, and he is a Poligerent. Mury claims to be working for all the Earthmen who lost their jobs when the government made a deal with Mars. The Martians have sent a power cylinder to Earth that is supposed to restore power to Earth; however, Mury explains that the people who rule Earth\u2019s nations have sold the planet in exchange for the device because Earth will become a colony of Mars. He claims that the Martians view Earth as a ready labor pool of slaves. Mury wants Ryd to help him prevent the power shell from reaching Earth. Ryd doesn\u2019t want to agree to help but knows that if he doesn\u2019t, Mury will kill him.\n\tMury and Ryd go to the airstrip where the Martian ship and its township have landed. Mury kills a guard and orders Ryd to don the uniform; he plans for Ryd to act as his escort to the towship so that he can go aboard. In their guises, Ryd and Mury make their way to the township unaccosted until one guard becomes suspicious and confronts them. When Mury offers to show him his credentials, Mury hits him in the stomach and brings him aboard the towship. The pilots and an astrogator are in the cockpit when Mury enters and sends the pilots out. The ship takes off, and when it nears the orbit of the Moon, Ryd comes to and asks where they are. Mury and the astrogator notice a bright light on the radar screen which indicates a ship. The astrogator claims it is a ship on a diplomatic mission for Mars, but Mury claims it is a warship because of its speed. He says the ship is looking for them and will intercept them in twenty minutes.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Some time in the future, Earth has sold the planet to Mars and become a colony of the Red Planet. This causes unrest for laborers who feel Mars is allowing Earth to degrade so that they can export human labor to Mars at very low cost. In the city of Dynamopolis, their main industry is distributing power, which once made them the power center of North America. \n\nThere is a spaceport, Pi Mesa, that receives essential supplies for Earth to continue existing, such as the power cylinder send from Mars as aid to Earth that is rumored to have landed there.  The power shell means an end to an electrical blackout the people of Earth are currently suffering from and the creation of jobs for the people of Dynamopolis.\n\nA scary figure named Mury meets Ryd Randl, a helio operator currently out of work, at the Stumble Inn bar in Dynamopolis. Mury forces Ryd into a grand plan to board a Martian spaceship on Pi Mesa to intercept a power shell in outer space and stop it from being delivered to Earth. Mury wishes to start a sort of revolution on Earth for it to become independent from Mars again, and describes that there is an \u201cinescapable conflict\u201d coming between Earth and Mars.\n\nMury and Ryd invade the Pi Mesa spaceport by killing a guard, and taking his clothes to disguise Ryd as a guard escorting Mury. This disguise works for a time until one of the Martian guards senses something is wrong and tries to stop them. They narrowly make it aboard a towship called Shahrazad which they believe is going into space to retrieve a power shell to bring down to Earth. They force the captain and crew into an airlock, except for the astronavigator named Arliess, who Mury forces to continue working by holding their planned course. \n\nWhen they blast off into outer space, Mury spots a Martian warship which may confirm his suspicion that Mars was about to begin a war with Earth. This is where the story ends.\n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Set in the 800s 14,000 feet in the sky, Ryd Randl gets his first free drink of the month. He walks into Burshis\u2019 Stumble Inn where the bartender, Burshis, hands him a drink. There\u2019s buzz about the arrival of power from Mars. Dynamopolis has been desolate for at least a decade. This center lacked power and many lost their jobs over it. So, this new deal struck with Mars is giving people hope again. Randl laughs it off, however. He was laid off 10 years ago and gave up on finding another job.  \nThe beak-nosed, scary man next to him drags Randl outside, after paying for his drink and offering him money. He introduces himself as Mury and proposes a deal. A revolutionary, Mury wants to stop the shipment to protect Earthmen from becoming Martian slaves. He needs Randl\u2019s help, and he\u2019ll pay 50,000 credits. Ryd agrees, and they make the trek to Pi Mesa. Mury kills a guard on the way up, and Ryd changes into his clothes, flame pistol included. Now Mury will pretend to be a Poligerent of Dynamopolis so they can board the Shahrazad. \nThey break into the spaceport successfully and continue on. Their disguises work for the most part, though Ryd\u2019s nervous behavior makes them suspicious. Making their way down the runways, they finally arrive at the Communications Tower. On the tarmac lay Shahrazad, but guards both human and robot were everywhere. They made it onto the airlock before another guard took notice. He rushes after them and asks them who they are. Mury turns and tells him his credentials, then offers to show him ID. He then punches him and disarms him. The guard comes onboard as their captive. At first, the switches don\u2019t work, but Mury calms Ryd down. When the central control panel is cut, then the ship will take off.  \nRyd is supposed to be covering the guard when he slips and drops his weapon. The guard picks it up but is soon defeated. Mury forces the young pilot, Yet Arliess, to take off, while he sends the other two men to the airlock. The pilot does as he says, and all is well until Mury notices something on the map. There\u2019s a bright light, one that wasn\u2019t there before. A warship was coming for them, and although Arliess tried to lie, Mury saw straight through it. \n"

There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell.

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place in Dynamopolis, a city in North America, in the year 819. The city is flooded with searchlights, although there is very little power to go around. The Terrestrials must gather at the local bar, Stumble Inn, if they do not want to freeze to death. At one point, Dynamopolis was a wealthy city, known as the Port of Ten Thousand Ships. About ten years ago, the Power Company of North America and the Triplanet Freighting Company were shut down, and the majority of the Terrestrials lost their jobs. The only people with political power are the Poligerents, and unless a Terrestrial knows one of them, he or she is likely left without a way to make ends meet. The Terrestrials were recently told that the power will be restored once the power shell is put on Earth. The air is thin, but the Terrestrials have become accustomed to it.\n\nPi Mesa is the spaceport that hovers over the city. There are still unused ships hovering there from the days where it was an important port with lots of action. Just outside of Pi Mesa there are hundreds of low buildings that are abandoned because they are no longer useful. They contain fuel pumps and servicing equipment, and they serve as a constant reminder of the life the Terrestrials once lived. \n\nWhen Ryd and Mury break into the land patrolled by the guards in blue in the spaceport, they find narrow passages, spiral staircases, and cool metal walls covered in dust. The Communications Tower is nearby, and it is guarded by signal-men.  The soldier robots that are on patrol are about as tall as the average Terrestrial, and they are scarlet colored. They are unarmed and are mostly there to scare intruders away. \n\nMury and Ryd aim to get on a ship called Shahrazad, which rests on the Number Two Runway, waiting for takeoff. When they enter the ship, they find that the cabin is very hot and full of dials and needles. There is a curved control panel in front, and the ship makes a humming sound because of all of the air-purifiers onboard. \n\nMars is an important setting in the story, although the characters do not actually travel there. Mars is almost airless, so it is very easy to run a helio-dynamic engine. On Mars, they use robots for labor, and due to a law that has been passed, Terrestrials are forced to stay on Earth. \n",

So, they built Dynamopolis in the sky, specifically at an altitude of 14,000 feet. \nAround the early 800s, Dynamopolis took a turn for the worse. Despite being the largest power center in North America, Dynamopolis lost its power. Businesses, companies, and factories started shutting down and resources dwindled.

Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\n  \n \n  Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n  \n \n  \"Keep him covered.

Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\n  \n \n  Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause.

On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yet Arliess.\"\n  \n \n  \"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  drove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\n  \n \n  Ryd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\n  \n \n  A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\n  \n \n  Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\n  \n \n  Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\n  \n \n  Mury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\n  \n \n  Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n  \n \n  \"What's that, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\n   \n   Alborak\n   \n  , out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Mury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n  \n \n  \"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "Mury is a tall and ugly man with a great deal of confidence. When he finds Ryd in the bar, he immediately asks him to step outside and confronts him with a proposition. He is not overly concerned about getting caught talking about rebellion, and he is resolute about his decision to try and take over the spaceship that is about to take off. \nMury immediately gains Ryd\u2019s trust when he sympathizes with him about losing his job ten years ago. They are on the same team, angry about the way the Terrestrials have been treated since all of the jobs moved to Mars. He is forceful with Ryd, and he stares at him intensely whenever he is questioned. Mury claims to work for all the men who have been disadvantaged by the corrupt government. He coldly tells Ryd that he means nothing to Mury as an individual, and he is only interested in saving the Terrestrials from becoming the Martians\u2019 slaves. He believes that Earth is about to become a colony of Mars, and he is willing to risk his life to see that plan foiled. \n\nMury\u2019s tough attitude and willingness to act is demonstrated when he kills a guard by crushing his skull. He is unbothered by the incident and sees it as his only choice. Later, he pretends to be Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis for a moment, only so that he can punch another guard in the stomach, take his firearm, and shoot him. \n\nMury is able to stay calm when Ryd loses his cool. Even when Ryd accidentally fires his weapon inside the central control panel room, Mury focuses on the mission at hand. When he finally takes control of the three men on board the Shahrazad and demands that they takeoff for Mars immediately, he is unfazed by their refusal. He snaps at the pilot and the other two workers and points his gun at them to indicate that he is dead serious about killing them if they do not comply. \n\nMury is so sure of himself that it comes as a big surprise when the pilot tells him that he must not have looked at the log for the day. The Alborak is on a diplomatic mission to Mars, and it is something that Mury overlooked. He does not realize that the ship is fully aware that the Shahrazad has been hijacked, and it\u2019s coming right for them. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Mury conducts himself with confidence and the assurance that he is right and on the right side. When he meets Ryd in the bar, he immediately recognizes him and asks to speak with him. Mury is on a mission and believes it is one that will vindicate many Earthmen. Mury also understands Ryd, and when Ryd is reluctant to work with him, Mury offers him money which Ryd can hardly refuse after so many years of unemployment. Mury is sure that he is right and does not hesitate to use violent means to meet his ends. He believes the governments of the Earth\u2019s nations have sold out to the Martians and that the Martians will use the Earthmen as cheap slave labor. Mury often comes across as angry and upset at the agreement the government leaders made with Mars. Mury convinces the blond astrogator of the township to help him return the ship to space. When it becomes evident there is a warship moving toward them, he maintains his calm even though he estimates the ship will reach them in twenty minutes or less. ",
        "Summary_3": "Mury takes a certain level of control over Ryd at the beginning of the story by coaxing him to leave the bar and forcing him to perform his bidding by maintaining a fear that he will have Ryd killed if he does not obey.\n\nMury is not forthcoming with his plan, preferring to play a controlling mastermind role - only telling Ryd details as they are necessary for him to know. Mury is willing to kill to accomplish his plan which he does to obtain a guards uniform to carry out his plan.\n\nMury maintains a sense of control through the whole story until the very end when he unexpectedly sees a Martian warship which clearly startles him.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Mury, which may not be his real name, is a revolutionary man. He makes himself clear at the beginning; he doesn\u2019t care about individuals, but Earthmen as a whole. With a bony face, large nose, and expensive clothing, Mury makes an impression. He\u2019s confident and sure of himself, until the last moment of the story when he is thwarted by the young pilot. \nWhen he picks up Ryd, he uses intimidation tactics and more to influence his decision. He killed one guard along the way up the mountain and possibly another one on the ship. He pretends to be a higher-up of society to sneak onto the ship and succeeds. He believes in Earthmen and revivifying Dynamopolis. He\u2019s driven by halting this power deal between Dynamopolis and Mars to prevent any Earthmen from becoming nothing more than cheap labor. \n"

A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty.

        "Summary_1": "The Earthmen are desolate because their ability to support themselves has been taken away by the people in power. Like many others, Ryd was a helio engineer, and he made a good living in the North American city of Dynamopolis. However, about a decade ago, all of the buildings were shuttered, and the Port of Ten Thousand Ships, Pi Mesa, was essentially closed. The people who live in Dynamopolis were actually luckier than other Terrestrials because theirs was the final port to close. \nThe people in charge discovered that Mars has a thinner atmosphere, and they decided to move all of the work to the red planet. However, they did not transport the Terrestrials to a new land and give them an opportunity to continue working. Instead, they created robots who could easily do the humans\u2019 jobs for a lot less money. \nElectricity is hard to come by on Dynamopolis, and the energy that is left goes to Pi Mesa. Although people like the local bartender, Burshis, believe the people in power when they say that energy will soon be restored when the power cylinder is brought to Earth, others, like Mury and Ryd, are much more skeptical. They see the writing on the wall: the Terrestrials will continue to be used and abused, and all of the much-needed resources will go towards Mars, the new frontier. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Many Earthmen are desolate because the economy is so bad. Many of them lost their jobs up to a decade ago and have not been able to find work since then. Many businesses are shut down since they don\u2019t have the power to operate. Many of the men in the bar must be homeless as Ryd thinks to himself that Burshis\u2019 bar is one of the few open places, and approximately half of the men inside are asleep on the tables or on the floor to get out of the cold so they don\u2019t freeze to death. The loss of power occurred because helio-dynamic engines worked so much better in the Martian atmosphere and because robot labor made Mars fully independent economically. Furthermore, the government issued the Restriction Act to keep Earthmen on Earth and prevent them from moving to Mars or elsewhere to seek employment. The men in charge of Earth\u2019s governments have also made a deal with Mars for the power cell to restore power to Earth, but in exchange, Earth will be a Martian colony, making Earthmen slaves to Martians for all practical purposes.",
        "Summary_3": "They do not have jobs and the planet appears to be totally reliant on the aid being provided by Mars. Since the planet Earth was sold to Mars, they have become a colony to Mars. Some people on Earth (represented by Mury) are of the opinion that Earth\u2019s government is not acting in a way that benefits their lives, thus leaving them in desolation because the current relationship between the planets allows Mars to pay people from Earth extremely low wages.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Although it was originally the largest power center, lack of resources, funding, and jobs have led Dynamopolis down a dark path. Many people were laid off as the power plants shut down, including the 809 shutdown of the Power Company of North America. \nThe space station, landing pad, and runway hovers above Dynamopolis. Pi Mesa is the only working spaceport in Dynamopolis. \nThe lack of power and the Restriction Act forced everything to stop. Earthmen weren\u2019t allowed to go to Mars, even though they had full economic independence and the space to support them. So, now Dynamopolis is making a deal with Mars: power for labor. After losing all their jobs (a power center with no power),  it was no wonder that the earthmen wound up in the situation that they did. \n"

A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n  \n \n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\n  \n \n  They emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\n  \n \n  As the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\n  \n \n  And indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\n  \n \n  Not far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\n  \n \n  And out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  , panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n  \n \n  \"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  when she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n  \n \n  \"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where else?\" said Mury.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Ryd is a resentful and skeptical person because he has been without a job for at least ten years. His only solace comes from drinking at Burshis\u2019 Stumble Inn, where he can pretend that no one knows him and have a nice chat with the bar owner. \n\nHe knows he was a good helio engineer, and he is fully aware that he did not deserve to have his job ripped from his hands. When the bartender suggests that he will have a new job soon, Ryd thinks to himself that anyone who wants to give him a job can screw off. He has been without one for too long to even know how to manage it. \n\nRyd is also skeptical of people around him. When Mury approaches him at the bar, he notices right away that Mury seems out of place in the way that he\u2019s dressed. He also gives Mury an attitude when the man starts a conversation with him. He has learned not to trust many people, so he acts contrary to his natural intuition when he listens to Mury and almost immediately believes he has his best interest in mind.\n\nRyd is not a trained spy or someone who has a lot of experience with committing crimes, so he is very out of place on his mission with Mury. He is jumpy, anxious, and concerned for his safety throughout the job. He is so uncomfortable holding a weapon that he actually drops his flame pistol in a control room and nearly starts a fire. He leaves the dirty work to Mury, and he does not offer to shoot anyone or engage in combat or do anything that isn\u2019t directly asked of him. Ryd goes along for the ride because he is afraid that Mury will kill him if he backs out of the mission, and he also realizes that Mury\u2019s plan may be the only thing that saves men like him from becoming slaves. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Ryd is a man who lost his job a decade ago and still feels badly about it since he hasn\u2019t been able to find a job since then. He is somewhat angry about losing his job because it wasn\u2019t lost through any wrongdoing on his part but because he was a helio operator, and helios worked much better on Mars. He has a reputation now for asking people for loans, so when they see him, no one wants to look him in the eye for fear that he will ask for yet more money. When the owner of Burshis points out that the power cylinder from Mars will bring back jobs, Ryd acknowledges to himself that there won\u2019t be any jobs for him; he is out of the habit of working now. Ryd has a mostly fearful outlook on life now. When Mury wants to speak with him outside the bar, Ryd is suspicious and worries that Mury might be a police officer. Ryd also feels that no one is sympathetic with him; when he did try to get another job, he was turned down because he wasn\u2019t allied with the Poligerents. After Ryd mentions the power cylinder as the salvation of Earth, Mury lets him know that this view is based on lies because the deal is based on Earth becoming a colony of Mars. When Ryd is reluctant to help Mury, the mention of money helps sway him to help as does the thought that they will kill him now that he knows so much if he doesn\u2019t help. At the same time, Ryd wants to help Mury to win his approval. Ryd goes along with Mury\u2019s plans, not because he believes in the cause but because he is afraid. Ryd remains fearful and uncertain in each part of the plan as they carry it out, and he relies on Mury\u2019s calm, cool demeanor and assurances to keep from falling apart.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Ryd Randl was a helio operator, who lost his job some time ago. He is struggling like many other people on Earth because of the black out power outages and inability to find work. His eagerness to get new work causes him to take risks, and get involved with Mury\u2019s revolutionary plan. Ryd comes across as a law-abiding Earth citizen who is deeply uncomfortable with the crimes Mury ropes him into, but goes along with them in order to be paid.\n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Ryd is an Earthman who has been out of work for the past decade. His struggles with finding another job, making enough money to get by, and general hardships have made him somewhat bitter and static. Ryd is first introduced on cold Dynamopolis when he\u2019s entering a pub, knowing he can\u2019t pay for anything. He\u2019s lucky to get his first free drink of the month, and he savors his alcohol. \nAlthough Ryd looked for a new job at first, he soon grew to resent the institution and men that had forced him out of his position. He was a helio operator, and a damn good one according to him, and enjoyed his job. Now, after being out of work for 10 years, he\u2019d rather stick it to the man than beg for a new position. \nThroughout his adventure with Mury, Ryd falters on the occasion. He is not cowardly, but he is certainly not as experienced or as dangerous as Mury. However, since Ryd has nothing to lose--truly, no house, no job, no family--he can do whatever Mury asks him to, though he will pester him with questions along the way. \n"

        "Query": "What is the cultural significance of the Serpent River in THE SERPENT RIVER?",
        "Article": "class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  THE SERPENT RIVER\n  \n \n  By Don Wilcox\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Other Worlds May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I brought our ship down to a quiet landing on the\nsummit of a mile-wide naked rock, and I turned to the telescope for a\ncloser view of the strange thing we had come to see.\n  \n \n  It shone, eighteen or twenty miles away, in the light of the late\nafternoon sun. It was a long silvery serpent-like\n   \n   something\n   \n  that\ncrawled slowly over the planet's surface.\n  \n \n  There was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It\nmight have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain\u2014or a chain\nof mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had\nshaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow\ntube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their\nskyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along\nthe surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of\nsolid substance.\n  \n \n  We could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from\nthis distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course\nfor centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn\npath between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the\nhorizon.\n  \n \n \n   What was it?\n   \n \n \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers.\nOur sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good\nWill Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first\nexpedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important\npieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned)\nhad brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts\nof the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this\nplanet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and\n(2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land,\ncontinuously, endlessly.\n  \n \n  We had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance\nfrom the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred\nnot to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly\nvibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it\nproved to be some sort of vegetable\u2014a vine of glacier proportions\u2014or\na river of some silvery, creamy substance\u2014we would move in upon it\ngradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon\n\"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of\nsplit-hairs.\n  \n \n  Split was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment.\n  \n \n  I looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn\neagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare\nyoung Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse!\n  \n \n  \"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before I finish the reports, sir? If I recall our Code, Section Two,\nOrder of Duties upon Landing: A\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See\nit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from\nunder its belly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir. An excellent view, Captain Linden.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think of it, Split? Ever see a sight like that before?\"\n  \n \n  \"No sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what about it? Any comments?\"\n  \n \n  Split answered me with an enthusiastic, \"By gollies, sir!\" Then, with\nrestraint, \"It's precisely what I expected from the photographs, sir.\nAny orders, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Relax, Split! That's the order. Relax!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks\u2014thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though\ncoming from him it was strained. His training had given him an\nexaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.\n  \n \n  He was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all,\nhis scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his\nwords even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he\nrequired in his coffee.\n  \n \n  Needless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits.\nAcross the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled\n(our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I\nhad sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim\nhis fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually\nphysically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the\npart. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"\u2014and the wide ears that\nstuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of\nselfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I\ncould rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.\n  \n \n  Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.\n  \n \n  \"What do you see?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot say definitely. The exact scientific classification of the\nobject I am observing would call for more detailed scrutiny\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're seeing some sort of object?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of object?\"\n  \n \n  \"A living creature, sir\u2014upright, wearing clothes\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   man\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"To all appearances, sir\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You bounder, give me that telescope!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  complex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n  \n \n  \"And what?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n  \n \n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n  \n \n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n  \n \n  The old man was dead.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Captain Linden and his lieutenant \"Split\" Campbell make up the first manned expedition from Earth to this particular planet, aiming to investigate a large silver river on its surface. The seemingly-endless silvery strip that traveled the planet's surface was unidentifiable as of yet. They see the river-like thing early on, but Campbell spots a humanoid through his telescope--this being is much like a human man, including the fact that he wore clothing. Captain Linden decides it's time for introductions, as if he senses he can trust this being, but they watch as a female and then many other people join the first man on the surface, seemingly coming out of an underground city. Linden and Campbell think their ship is out of sight, and watch a ritual that the man is performing to the setting sun. The crowd of people continues to increase, and Linden notices that the landscape is moving: trees are shifting in the ground. He and Campbell stay in the ship and observe the various types of clothing and the ritual itself, as well as the moving trees which seemed to be moving to attack the people. They are indeed warriors starting an attack, and started swinging weapons. Linden tells Campbell to start the siren on their ship to scare away the attackers, and the first man they'd seen, presumably the leader, starts towards the ship. Once they are close enough, it is obvious that the humanoids don't have eyebrows or eye lashes. Captain Linden hands the leader a medallion that plays a song, as a token of friendship. Tomboldo, the leader, starts a round of introductions through a lot of gesturing. Linden hopes to learn about the Serpent River through the people to understand its cultural significance, and these people start to ask about the siren noises. The warriors attack again and panic ensues, pushing the humans to use weapons this time. Gravgak, the guard who had been escorting the humans, is knocked down. As Linden tries to tend to him, Gravgak knocks him out with his club. Linden is unconscious for a few weeks, and Vauna, Tomboldo's daughter, spends a lot of time by the Captian's side. Linden reminds Campbell that they weren't allowed to marry anyone from this planet, but mostly in an effort to warn himself to be careful around Vauna. He learns that these people are called the Benzendellas. Tomboldo is baffled by the technology that the humans have, but Linden is not able to communicate his questions about the Serpent River. He sees Gravgak, who apologizes for the accidental injury, but from Vauna's reaction Linden is not sure if he is telling the truth. Gravgak insists on talking to Vauna in private, but Vauna's father calls them back. It is Tomboldo's thanks to the humans that gives a glimpse into the meaning of the Serpent River: he says the humans will ride with them on the rope of life, which they call Kao-Wagwattl.",
        "Summary_2": "The story relates the experience of two agents who travel to an unnamed planet for Earth-Galaxy Good Will Expeditions (EGGWE). An unmanned camera has brought pictures from the planet back to Earth, showing two features of particular interest: 1) a human-like species, the Benzendella, living there, and 2) a rope-like, silvery undulating river. Captain Linden is the commander of the mission; his lieutenant is \u201cSplit\u201d Campbell. After traveling millions of miles to reach the planet, the men land and use their telescope to check their surroundings before alighting from the spaceship. They see the river and the human-like beings who look like human ancestors from a million years ago. As they watch, the leader of the humans seems to perform a kind of ritual, but then, Linden notices some trees moving uphill and watches in horror as warriors toss the trees aside and launch an attack on the humans using clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends. To avert a massacre, Linden orders Campbell to hit the siren, which startles the attackers so that they retreat. Linden and Campbell then approach the people and give the leader, Tomboldo, a musical medallion on a chain. Introductions are exchanged, and some of the humans make the siren sound, indicating they want to hear it again, but the attackers return. Linden throws a capsule bomb at them, making them fall back briefly, but they quickly resume their attack. Finally, Linden and Campbell throw fire at the attackers, wounding many of them, and they retreat. One of the Benzendella men who acts as a guard, Gravgak, is injured, and Linden and Campbell treat and wrap his wounds; when they finish, they use smelling salts to rouse him, and he jumps up swinging one of the clubs he has picked up. The rock on the end of it hits Linden, causing a head injury and knocking him unconscious. While he is recuperating, Tomboldo\u2019s daughter Vauna takes care of him, and when Linden regains consciousness, he falls in love with her and has to remind himself of Clause D of the EGGWE Code that restricts marriage between agents and natives. Gravgak visits him to say that he did not intentionally hit Linden with the rock, but Linden doubts his sincerity. Gravgak then orders Vauna to speak with him in private, but her father stops them to announce that the council has decided they will move back to the other part of their world. They will travel on the rope river and want Linden and Campbell to go with them.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Jim Linden and \"Split\" Campbell travel to a planet previously photographed by unmanned rovers as representatives of the EGGWE, the Earth-Galaxy Good Will Expeditions. Thier purpose is to study new planets and forge peaceful relationships with native inhabitants in order to establish trade partnerships. The Keynes-Roy cameras had captured images of humanoid natives as well as a massive, silvery \"rope\" that appeared to move along the planet's surfaces, so Linden and Campbell hope to identify the \"rope.\" They station at a safe distance from it, since they are unsure of its purpose, and, during their observations, they witness a group of native Benzendella emerge from their underground city for some kind of sunset ritual. As the group gathers around their leader--a muscular individual clothed in a cream-colored robe and red headdress--Jim and Split notice a group of trees drifting slowly over the sand towards the Benzendellas. They quickly realize the trees disguise a hostile group intending to ambush the natives. When they throw off their disguises and begin to charge, Split triggers one of the ship's sirens, and the attackers retreat back to the trees. Jim and Split walk to meet the group's leader, Tomboldo, and they offer a gift as a gesture of good will. Tomboldo has a guard, Gravgak, protect them as they make their way back to the city, and Gravgak tells them to mimic the ship's siren in order to keep the attackers at bay. However, the antagonists attack again, and Jim deploys one of his capsule bombs. Gravgak retrieves one of the attacker's clubs and runs towards them. Jim cannot decide if this is a bold move to protect the Benzendellas or a kind of warning about Jim's weapons, which would reveal Gravgak's loyalties might not be completely steadfast. When Gravgak is injured in the ensuing battle, Jim and Split revive him, and Gravgak impulsively grabs the club again and whacks Jim with it, leaving him in a state of unconsciousness. For a length of time, Jim remains in this comatose state, drifting in and out of consciousness as Split plays records of the Benzendella language and Tomboldo's daughter, Vauna, helps nurse him back to health. During this period, Jim realizes he has developed strong feelings for Vauna, and she seems to share these emotions. He tells Split to remind him of the EGGWE's Code of Conduct which bars adherents from marrying natives on planets they explore. When he awakens, Gravgak apologizes although Jim suspects the apology is insincere, and that he is either jealous of his relationship to Vauna or he is, in fact, a traitor to the Benzendellas. Tomboldo announces that because of the threat to their people, they will use the silvery \"rope of life\" called Kao-Wagwattl to find another spot to live on the planet and bring Jim and Split with them.",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Linden and his awkward and studious lieutenant \u201cSplit\u201d Campbell arrive as the first human expedition on a strange planet. They are members of the Earth-Galaxy Good Will Expeditions (EGGWE) and Split followed their rules dutifully. Thanks to photographs, they are aware that this planet is inhabited by human-like creatures and that there is a large, serpent-like thing running through it. They land on the planet and peer through the telescope. Soon, a man and a woman rise up from the earth and stand on top of the flat, empty rock to watch the sunset. They are joined by more and more people, around 40 eventually. Split and Linden watch in awe as the leader, a man in robes and a headdress, performs some sort of ritual. Linden notices that the trees are moving towards them, nothing too unusual. He\u2019d seen sponge-trees before on other planets. However, these trees were being used as a cover for an attack. A horde of naked warriors rushes out with clubs and circles the ceremony. Linden orders Split to hit #16, and a siren wails out from their spaceship. It shakes the warriors to their core, and they retreat. Split and Linden gather up their supplies and exit the ship. The leader, having noticed their ship during the wailing, makes his way towards them. With 10-minutes left on the wailing, Linden believes they should be safe, but they carry small bombs (specifically special-purpose capsule bombs) with them as well. \nAs they get closer, Split notices how human these creatures look, aside from the lack of eyebrows and eyelashes. Linden offers their leader a gift, a singing necklace in the shape of a coin that plays \u201cTrail of Stars\u201d when pressed. The leader introduces himself as Tomboldo, and each member follows. Gravgak is introduced, a large, muscular alien covered in green and black painted diamonds, and he is tasked with protecting Linden and Split. Tomboldo invites them underground, where they can speak safely. They agree, needing to know more about the Serpent River. \nThey start wailing, just like the siren, in the hopes that it would keep the attackers at bay. However, the sponge-trees started moving again and danger struck. Linden and Split threw their bombs at the warriors and took them down, but not quick enough. Gravgak was injured and lay on the ground. Split and Linden bandaged him, and when he woke up, he \u201caccidentally\u201d hit Linden over the head with his club. \nLinden is taken care of by Vauna, Tomboldo\u2019s daughter, and her assistant, Omosla. He was very injured, even needing surgery performed by Split. Eventually, his health is restored and he\u2019s caught feelings for Vauna, despite Section Four Clause D of the conduct of EGGWE. Vauna and Gravgak are potentially in a relationship, but Tomboldo does not approve. The Benzendella are sleep-singers and their song echoes in the night. Tomboldo invites Linden and Split to accompany his people on a journey to safety aboard the Kao-Wagwattl, or the Serpent River. "

When Linden and Campbell throw fire at the enemy, he is so close that the fire and blasts of rock knock him down.

Gravgak keeps watch for the tree-disguised warriors and guards Jim and Split on their way back to the underground city. However, he shows signs of agitation and distraction and commands the two men to mimic the siren sounds along with the rest of Tomboldo's party. When the attackers once again descend upon their party and Jim throws a capsule bomb at them, Gravgak retrieves one of their clubs and charges. Jim interprets this behavior to mean one of two things--either Gravgak bravely defends his people or he intends to warn the attackers of Jim and Split's advanced weaponry.

It was a long silvery serpent-like\n   \n   something\n   \n  that\ncrawled slowly over the planet's surface.\n  \n \n  There was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It\nmight have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain\u2014or a chain\nof mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had\nshaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow\ntube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their\nskyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along\nthe surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of\nsolid substance.\n  \n \n  We could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from\nthis distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course\nfor centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn\npath between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the\nhorizon.\n  \n \n \n   What was it?\n   \n \n \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers.\nOur sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good\nWill Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first\nexpedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important\npieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned)\nhad brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts\nof the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this\nplanet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and\n(2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land,\ncontinuously, endlessly.\n  \n \n  We had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance\nfrom the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred\nnot to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly\nvibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it\nproved to be some sort of vegetable\u2014a vine of glacier proportions\u2014or\na river of some silvery, creamy substance\u2014we would move in upon it\ngradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon\n\"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of\nsplit-hairs.\n  \n \n  Split was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment.\n  \n \n  I looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn\neagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare\nyoung Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse!\n  \n \n  \"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before I finish the reports, sir?

That's the order. Relax!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks\u2014thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though\ncoming from him it was strained. His training had given him an\nexaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.\n  \n \n  He was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all,\nhis scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his\nwords even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he\nrequired in his coffee.\n  \n \n  Needless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits.\nAcross the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled\n(our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I\nhad sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim\nhis fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually\nphysically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the\npart. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"\u2014and the wide ears that\nstuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of\nselfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I\ncould rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.\n  \n \n  Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.\n  \n \n  \"What do you see?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot say definitely.

His green spacesuit struck an incongruous note against the\nbronze and red forest. \"They won't all look like ducks,\" he said\nsoberly.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe some will look like dragons.

A patch of sunlight struck a\ngreenish glint from his fishbowl helmet.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Linden and Campbell arrive at the planet, they are primarily interested in the snaking silver rope that travels around the continent like a river, but they notice some people seemingly coming from underground. As these people were performing a ritual, the humans noticed an impending attack from a different group, but didn't want to use weapons so they started a siren on their ship to distract the attackers. This siren did scare these attackers off for a while, and when Linden and Campbell started trying to communicate with the Benzendella people the only thing the Benzendellas could say was an imitation of the siren noise. It was this siren that saved the people from the initial attack, and thus made these people trust the humans, but was also the beginning of their attempts at communication. In an indirect way, using this siren is how the humans ended up with a chance to ask the Benzendella people about the Serpent River that they came to learn more about. ",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Linden and Split Campbell use the sirens to scare away the attackers in the sponge trees to protect the Benzendella people. Because the people on the planet don\u2019t have advanced technology, they don\u2019t know what causes the sound of the siren, and it startles them so much that they pull back their attack. Linden and Campbell likely avert a massacre because the attackers in the trees are armed with clubs and whips with stones tied to the ends; taking their quarry by surprise with these weapons would put them at a distinct advantage. The Benzendella were engaged in some type of ritual and were unarmed when the attackers surprised them. Once the Benzendella realize the two men were responsible for the siren that saved them from the attack, they are willing to meet them close up. When the Benzendella speak to them, they make the siren sounds and seem to want the men to cause them to sound again. When the warriors launch another attack, Linden and Campbell throw a capsule bomb at them, making them drop back again, but once again, they push forward. Linden and Campbell throw fire at the warriors, making the rock break and fly up and hit them. Some of the warriors are killed or disabled, and the rest flee. So the siren is the start of a friendship between the two men on the expedition and the native people of the planet.\n",
        "Summary_3": "When the tree-disguised attackers descend upon the Benzendellas, Jim orders Split to trigger the \"number sixteen siren\", which emits a loud wail and causes the attackers to retreat. Jim and Split set the siren to ten minutes as they begin their half-mile hike to meet Tomboldo and his party. This offers them some security as they walk in addition to their stash of capsule bombs. Fearing another attack, Tomboldo and his crew of guards and officials mimic the siren sound as they make their way back to their city in order to ward off their enemies. While the legitimate siren sound keeps the attackers away, the copycat sound made by Tomboldo's people does not fool them, and they attack once more. This gives Jim the opportunity to deploy his capsule bombs, and Gravgak's actions in response lead him to further question the loyalty of Tomboldo's guard. Jim also winds up in a state of unconsciousness as a result of the attack, and this is how he meets and falls in love with Tomboldo's daughter Vauna.",
        "Summary_4": "The siren saves the lives of the Benzendella people. As the sponge-tree warriors attacked them, Captain Linden ordered Split to hit #16, the siren. The sound pierced the sunset and caused the warriors to retreat. After saving the Benzendella, Tomboldo is indebted to Linden and Split. He invites them to their home underground and eventually on a trip across the Serpent River. \nThe siren is the beginning of the relationship between the humans and the Benzendella. Their gratitude allows Linden and Split to become their friends and acquaintances. The siren also showed how vulnerable the Benzendella are to attack when on the surface of the planet. Later, the Benzedella attempt to mimic the siren in an attempt to keep the warriors at bay. \n"

He hoped that interacting with the humanoids would allow him to learn some cultural significance behind what he referred to as the Serpent River, which he also planned on studying scientifically. After he landed, while Campbell was monitoring the humanoids, he noticed that trees were moving towards the people, and sensed an incoming attack.

From images brought back to Earth by a roving camera, they know that humanoids live on the planet, and there is a huge rope or serpent-like object or creature moving continuously across the surface. He and Split Campbell cautiously land a good distance from the rope-like object in case it is dangerous. Although he is in command, Linden has a good sense of humor and likes to joke with and poke fun at Split; in fact, Linden is the one who gave him his nickname.

After exclaiming rather unprofessionally at what he sees, Linden \u201corders\u201d him to take it easy. The two men are on their first voyage together, and Linden has entertained himself on the journey of millions of miles by teasing Campbell. Linden has been to six other planets, but none of them had beings that were so similar to humans; the ones on the current planet look like the human ancestors from one million years ago, and Linden is very excited about this. Linden senses that the humanoids are friendly and trusts his intuition; this is why he decides to help them when the other group attacks them. He tries to befriend the leader by offering him a singing medallion on a chain, but what really impresses them is the way he and Campbell help them when the attackers return. After the battle, Linden is hit in the head by a rock attached to the club that Gravgak used when Gravgak jumps up after being roused to consciousness. Linden suffers a head injury and is unconscious for several days. While he is recuperating, the humanoid leader\u2019s daughter Vauna cares for him, and he falls in love with her. Linden reminds Campbell of Clause D of the EGGWE Code, which states that none of their agents can marry a native but then admits he is reminding himself of this, not Campbell. When Gravgak states he is ready to talk to Vauna alone, Linden reaches for her hand, letting her know his feelings about her.

You must get well, Captain.\" The words of\nCampbell came through insistently.\n  \n \n  After a silence that may have lasted for hours or days, I said,\n\"Campbell, you haven't forgot the EGGWE Code?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Section Four?\"\n  \n \n  \"Section Four,\" he repeated in a low voice, as if to pacify me and put\nme to sleep. \"Conduct of EGGWE agents toward native inhabitants: A, No\nagent shall enter into any diplomatic agreement that shall be construed\nas binding\u2014\"\n  \n \n  I interrupted. \"Clause D?\"\n  \n \n  He picked it up. \"D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with\nany native.... H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain\nLinden? Or are you warning\n   \n   yourself\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred\nvision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her\u2014yes, she must have\nhaunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her\nfeatures more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the\nparty of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the\nattack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and\nfigure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's\nquestion. \"Myself.\"\n  \n \n  In the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna.\nThe caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella\npeople lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of\ntheir life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning\nabout the world into which he has been born.\n  \n \n  Sometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla talking together.\nOften when Campbell would stop in this part of the cavern to inquire\nabout me, Omosla would drop in also. She and Campbell were learning to\nconverse in simple words. And Vauna and I\u2014yes. If I could only avoid\nblacking out.\n  \n \n  I wanted to see her.\n  \n \n  So often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares. Space\nships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars.\nThe eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of\nVauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand.\n  \n \n  I regained my health gradually.\n  \n \n  \"Are you quite awake?\" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella\nwords. \"You speak better today. Your friend Campbell has brought you\nmore recordings of our language, so you can learn to speak more. My\nfather is eager to talk with you. But you must sleep more. You are\nstill weak.\"\n  \n \n  It gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust\nmyself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By\nnight they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep.\nStrange harmonies whispered through the caves.\n  \n \n  And if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me\nthrough the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me,\nfaintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some\ncorridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to\ngo back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless\ndreams.\n  \n \n  The day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing\nbefore me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a\nhint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook\nthe fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his\nflowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and\nplayed, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have learned to talk,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"You have had a long sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am well again. See, I can almost walk.\" But as I started to rise,\nthe wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. \"I will\nwalk soon.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars\nand told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the\nship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make\nmyself believe.\" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of\nforehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying\nto visualize the flight of a space ship. \"We will have much to tell\neach other.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" I said. \"Campbell and I came to learn about the\n   \n   serpent\nriver\n   \n  .\" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not\nknowing the Benzendella equivalent.\n   \n   I\n   \n  made an eel-like motion\nwith my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain,\nthe footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked\naround to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent\nfigure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and\ngreen diamond markings\u2014Gravgak.\n  \n \n  \"You get well?\" Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely.\n  \n \n  \"I get well,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"The blow on the head,\" he said, \"was not meant.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant\nto be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes\ntold me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes\nflashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and\nstarted off. \"Get well!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway\nhe turned. \"Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.\"\n  \n \n  She started. I reached and barely touched her hand. She stopped. \"I\nwill talk with you later, Gravgak.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" he shouted. \"Alone.\"\n  \n \n  He stalked off. A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her\nfather, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak.\n  \n \n  From the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic\nmoment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master\u2014or her\nlover. He had called for her. She had followed.\n  \n \n  But her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door.\n\"Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.\"\n  \n \n  (I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called\nthem! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified? Had I become merely a\njealous lover\u2014or was I right in my hunch that the tall muscular guard\nwas a potential traitor?)\n  \n \n  Vauna reappeared at once. I believe she was glad that she had been\ncalled back.\n  \n \n  Gravgak came sullenly. At the edge of the crowd in the arched doorway\nhe stood scowling.\n  \n \n  \"While we are together,\" old Tomboldo said quietly, looking around at\nthe assemblage, \"I must tell you the decision of the council. Soon we\nwill move back to the other part of the world.\"\n  \n \n  There were low murmurs of approval through the chamber.\n  \n \n  \"We will wait a few days,\" Tomboldo went on, \"until our new friend\u2014\"\nhe pointed to me\u2014\"is well enough to travel. We would never leave him\nhere to the mercy of the savage ones. He and his helper came through\nthe sky in time to save us from being destroyed. We must never forget\nthis kindness. When we ascend the\n   \n   Kao-Wagwattl\n   \n  , the ever moving\n   \n   rope of life\n   \n  , these friends shall come with us.

Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n  \n \n  \"Captain\u2014\n   \n   Jim\n   \n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n  \n \n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n  \n \n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n  \n \n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n   \n   could\n   \n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n  \n \n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n  \n \n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n  \n \n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n  \n \n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n  \n \n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n  \n \n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n  \n \n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n  \n \n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n  \n \n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n  \n \n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n  \n \n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n  \n \n  Then the siren went off.\n  \n \n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n  \n \n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n  \n \n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n  \n \n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n  \n \n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n  \n \n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n  \n \n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n  \n \n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n  \n \n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n  \n \n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n  \n \n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n   \n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n  \n \n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n  \n \n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n  \n \n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n  \n \n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n   \n   warning\n   \n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n  \n \n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n  \n \n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n  \n \n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n  \n \n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n  \n \n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Linden is a fairly relaxed captain who is ready to perform his mission to code, but is almost amused at his lieutenant's inability to stray from code. He calls Campbell \"Split\" because he does everything so by-the-book that if he were combing his hair down the middle, he wouldn't be surprised if he split the hairs in the middle of his head for perfect symmetry. They seem to work well together, and Campbell is dedicated to his scientific mission and reviewing reports, while Linden reminds him to look at the window at the world around them, which offers a nice balance to their progress. Campbell clearly respects Linden a lot, and Linden is always kind to him and not rude or condescending, which is important for team cohesion on a mission away from a home planet. ",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Linden is the senior commanding officer of Lieutenant Split Campbell; however, Campbell is a much more by-the-book military man than Linden is. Linden has a sense of humor and enjoys teasing Campbell about his strict adherence to military standards and codes. He gives Campbell the nickname \u201cSplit\u201d because of Campbell\u2019s extreme attention to detail and teases that Campbell will split the hairs that pop up when he parts his hair. Linden wishes Campbell would lighten up a little and even orders him to relax. At the same time, Linden also knows that he can depend on Campbell to fulfill his duties. When the two agents witness the \u201ctrees\u201d moving toward the group of humanoids and realize they are actually warriors launching an attack, Split addresses Linden first as \u201cCaptain\u201d and then as \u201cJim\u201d as he worries about the group about to be attacked. Linden notices this and realizes that Split\u2019s formality drops when he is excited. The two men work well together, and Campbell seems to know what Linden wants from him without needing any orders. When Linden suffers a head injury after being hit by a rock, Campbell performs the surgery that relieves the pressure on his brain; he tells Linden he must get well, as if Campbell is counting on Linden both as a friend and an officer. As Linden realizes he is falling in love with Vauna, he reminds Campbell of the EGGWE Code Clause D, which prevents agents from marrying natives, and Campbell asks whether Linden is warning Campbell or himself. Campbell seems to be speaking to him as a friend by acknowledging that Linden has feelings for Vauna. At the same time, Campbell addresses Linden as \u201cCaptain,\u201d showing that their friendship does not place them on equal standing even though they are close enough to call each other by their first names.\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Jim gives Campbell the nickname \"Split\" because of his meticulous attention to detail and his need for order in life. Split memorizes the EGGWE code and recites relevant sections throughout the story such as when Jim asks him to recall the clause about the ban on marrying any natives whom agents might encounter during inter-planetary expeditions. After Gravgak clubs Jim, Split performs surgery on him during his state of unconsciousness in order to relieve pressure on his brain and even brings him recordings of the Benzendella language so that he can learn to speak while he gathers his strength. Split also communicates with Omosla and Tomboldo during Jim's coma-like state, so that he can learn more about the Benzendella people and share about the purpose of their own expedition. Jim\u2019s more spontaneous, empathetic approach to leadership complements Split\u2019s rigid commitment to rules, and this makes them a strong and effective team.",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Linden and Lieutenant \u201cSplit\u201d Campbell have developed a very friendly relationship over the course of their two expeditions. Linden even nicknamed Lieutenant Campbell \u201cSplit\u201d for his diligent and dutiful ways. Linden constantly teases Split and pushes him to think outside the box and outside the EGGWE\u2019s code of conduct. They can easily rely on each other, as can be seen in battle and underground. Split throws his bombs when being attacked by the warriors, even though Linden didn\u2019t order him to do so. Despite being a very diligent traveler, he recognizes that in times of crisis it\u2019s better to just act. As well, when Linden was gravely injured by Gravgak, Linden performs surgery to relieve the pressure on his brain and help him heal quicker."

        "Query": "What is the story behind POSAT and its secret society?",
        "Article": "Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today.

Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU\n   \n  can alter the course of your life!\n  \n \n  Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!\n  \n \n  The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\n  \n \n  POSAT\n  \n \n  an ancient secret society\n  \n \n  Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "\nIn 1953, an advertisement for the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth appears in magazines. The ad claims that POSAT is an ancient secret society looking for new members. Three individuals send away to receive a free booklet from them. Bill is a pharmacist who is down on his luck and out of a job. Elizabeth is a wealthy woman who lives with cats. Don is a research physicist who has a successful career and a wife, Betty. \n\nPOSAT sends Bill, Elizabeth, and Don three identical forms in the mail and asks for their responses. Bill is initially skeptical, but he hopes that POSAT will be able to turn his life around in some unexpected way. He answers the questions about his employment, religion, and finances. Elizabeth does the same enthusiastically. Although Don believes it\u2019s a scam, he can\u2019t squash his own curiosity, and he sends his answers in.\n\nIn return, Bill receives a pamphlet with vague descriptions for how to solve life\u2019s problems. He finds the material useless, but he isn\u2019t disappointed because he just landed a new job. Elizabeth discovers that she has been accepted into the society, and she must pay $5 a month. Lastly, Don receives a multiple choice exam, which he answers and sends back.\n\n\nDon receives a request to meet with the Grand Chairman at his work, and this surprises him because he never gave them his work address. He finds the warehouse and sees that it is windowless, rundown, and dirty. However, the waiting room contains beautiful rugs and paintings in ornate frames. He realizes that each painting is lit with a glowing tube that does not contain batteries, and he puts one of the lights in his pocket. It shocks him because his workplace is the only laboratory working on this exact product. He no longer trusts what is going on at POSAT and tries to leave, but the door is locked. \nDon is brought upstairs, and his fear increases when he looks into a high tech laboratory and sees scientists working on an atomic reactor. Dr. Crandon, Don\u2019s former professor, appears and introduces himself as the Grand Chairman. He tells Don that POSAT has been around for over four hundred years, and its founder invented the atomic reactor. He did not have the technology to build it, and he realized that humanity was not ready for such a weapon. He decided to share his knowledge with other geniuses and keep it all a secret. Their goal was to get humanity to a point where information could be shared without the threat of violence and death. Crandon shows Don the world\u2019s biggest computer, which is meant to learn humans\u2019 motivation. Don\u2019s test was put into the computer, and his responses indicate that he will join POSAT and be a valuable member. Bill was given a job to improve his life, and Elizabeth feels included and contributes financially. Don decides to join the secret society and work towards a more peaceful planet. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Various advertisements have gone through various magazines for POSAT, the \"Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\", offering a booklet that can be requested in the mail. Various people sent for the booklet, including Bill Evans, a pharmacist currently without work, Miss Elizabeth Arnable, an eager woman excited to learn, and Donald Alford, a research physicist driven by curiosity. The three of them received an identical form in return, and each filled out the long questionnaire with a large amount of personal information. Donald's wife tried to convince him to fill the form out with false answers, but he was honest as the others were. A week after these questionnaires were sent, POSAT sent different envelopes to these three people. Bill Evans, for instance, received a standard pamphlet with metaphysical discussion. He was disappointed by this but was pleased to be starting a new job near the POSAT offices soon, which he did not realized was connected. Miss Arnable received several pamphlets and an offer to pay dues, which she did immediately. Donald Alford received a series of multiple choice questions about moral decisions surrounding potentially dangerous events. His answers got him an interview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, but it would be in the middle of a work day, almost a hundred miles away. Although he was surprised to have received the letter at his lab, because he had only given POSAT his home address, his curiosity drove him to take the interview. It took him some time to find the POSAT headquarters, hidden in the back of an alley, and he was struck by the elegance of the first room he was invited into. He was slightly taller than the people the room was built for, hitting his head on a light and having to bend over to look at paintings. He found an impossible-seeming lightbulb, that resembled a secret project he was working on but in later stages. He was locked in the room, but eventually escorted to see the Grand Chairman, passing over an incredible laboratory with an atomic reactor. It turns out the Grand Chairman was Dr. Crandon, Donald's mentor, which made Donald confused, as he had trusted Dr. Crandon but could not trust what was happening in the laboratory he had seen. Dr. Crandon explained that although most of their work was illegal, he considered it some of the most moral work being done. Dr. Crandon walked Donald through the history of the organization, waxing poetic about the founder's genius as a physical scientist and mathematician. He did not have the technology to act on his theories, but left enough information for people in the future to develop technologies, following what Crandon called the path to truth. The primary goal was for science to be used without disaster, and Donald struggles accepting this knowing that atomic bombs exist. The machine with which they were studying human motivation is what read the entry questionnaires. His curiosity wins and Donald joins the research group.",
        "Summary_3": "Three people separately read and react to an advertisement for POSAT, the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth, which promises secret truths that can alter the course of one's life. Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, finds hope in the promise of superhuman intervention to help pull him from his desperate financial situation. Miss Elizabeth Arnable, a cat enthusiast who doesn\u2019t read, connects with the advertisement's religious and mystical undertones since she believes her cats to be reincarnated family members. Donald Alford, a research physicist, is the most skeptical among them, and his interest in POSAT is purely scientific; he wants to determine POSAT\u2019s true purpose, and so he completes the autobiographical form all three of them receive in response to their individual inquiries for more information. The impractical, metaphysical pamphlet Bill receives in response to his form disappoints him; however, he also receives a job offer at a pharmacy attached to the very warehouse that also houses POSAT's headquarters. Miss Arnable receives a membership pin, several pamphlets full of hidden truths of ancient wisdom, and information regarding membership fees. Don Alford receives a questionnaire that appears to be some kind of personality test catered to him specifically, despite the fact he has thus far revealed nothing of his life to them. Don's wife, Betty, wonders if POSAT might be some kind of spy society. In response to his questionnaire, POSAT invites Don to their headquarters to meet with their Grand Chairman in order to conduct an interview prior to his membership acceptance. Don struggles to decide whether or not to attend the meeting, considering the headquarters is nearly one-hundred miles from his home, and the lab where he works typically frowns upon using work time for personal matters. However, he decides to go anyway, and he finds the headquarters is part of a massive warehouse that is also home to a printer's plant, upholstering shop, and a pharmacy where Bill Evans now works. A receptionist guides him to a waiting room, where he discovers a number of brightly-lit Renaissance-style paintings. When he accidentally dislodges a light tube, he realizes the technology keeping it lit resembles his own research back at the lab--research that has not yet been released for public consumption. When he meets the Grand Chairman, he begins to make sense of the true purpose of POSAT; the Grand Chairman is actually Dr. Crandon, a physicist whose research Don has admired for several decades. Dr. Crandon explains POSAT is a society started four hundred years ago by a genius mathematician and physical scientist whose knowledge and discoveries were so advanced and powerful, he felt they must be kept secret until the world was ready to handle them in a responsible fashion. He shows Don a large computing machine used to determine human motivations and predict their reactions, which had been used to assess Don's suitability for membership, and which will be used to contribute to the advancement of a peaceful society. Don agrees to join Dr. Crandon's cause.",
        "Summary_4": "An ad was placed in the paper and several magazines throughout town, describing POSAT, the Pepetual Order of Seekers After Truth. It speaks vaguely about wisdom, changing your life, and mastering knowledge. Three people look at the ad in interest. The first is Bill Evans, a recently unemployed pharmacist, desperate for a miracle. He needs another job, a better life, so he responds to the ad as a last resort. The second is Miss Elizabeth Arnable, a cat-lady who loves the radio. And finally, Donald Alford, a physicist with a caring wife. He was reading a paper by Dr. Crandon, his former professor when he came across the advertisement. He responded simply because he was curious, and because their symbol piqued his interest. It looked almost like the Bohr atom of helium. \nThey all received identical booklets in the mail, promising the same stuff as the advertisement, but with a new form. All threw filled it out. Bill Evans took a while to do so, but he did so eventually with his desperation in tow. Miss Arnable wrote five pages, including the lives of her cats, and asked how much she would need to pay to be a member of POSAT. \nBut Alford was more skeptical, so he showed the booklet to his wife. She knew he was going to fill it out anyway because his curiosity would not be sated till he had an answer. He did just that.\nThe next mailings were completely different. Bill Evans\u2019 pamphlet was filled with vague and metaphysical realizations. But, the same day, he was miraculously offered a job at a wholesale pharmacy. Miss Arnable was accepted, sent pamphlets about cats, and asked to pay $5/month. After filling out a multiple-choice questionnaire, Alford was asked to come in for an interview with the Grand Master during his workday. The letter was sent to his office; the address he never revealed.  He took off the day to drive there and arrived at a small entrance down an alley near a wholesale pharmacy. He entered and climbed the stairs to the receptionist. She took his information then led him into the waiting room. Beautiful paintings lined the wall, lit up by radioactive, self-contained lights. He was in shock after making this discovery. His lab was working on such an invention, but failing at making the right material. He pocketed the light. \nThe receptionist led him across a balcony into the Grand Master\u2019s office. Below the balcony was a highly advanced laboratory. Equipment that had yet to be invented. When Alford entered the office, he realized the man in front of him was Dr. Crandon, his professor, and fellow scientist. He explains the history of POSAT, how advanced they are, and their current mission: to find out more about human motivation to solve world issues. Dr. Crandon shows him a supercomputer that is on the path to making this huge discovery. Alford joins POSAT. \n"

        "Query": "What is the location of the secret society in POSAT?",
        "Article": "Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind!

It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "\u201cWhat is POSAT?\u201d takes place in an unspecified city. Three of the characters, Bill, Elizabeth, and Don, lead ordinary lives and hold typical jobs. Don is a physicist, and the laboratory he works at is located about 100 miles away from the POSAT headquarters. \n\nThe POSAT headquarters is the main setting described in the story. It is located at the end of an alley in an unassuming warehouse, next to a wholesale pharmacy, an upholstery shop, and a printer\u2019s plant. The building is almost entirely windowless, and the only sign that the secret society is housed there is the organization\u2019s emblem on its door. \n\nVisitors enter a dark room with a staircase. A buzzer goes off to let the employees of POSAT know that someone has arrived. The reception room is dusty and highly unimpressive. The wallpaper and rugs are worn out and gray, and the woman who works at the beat-up reception desk is average looking. \n\nThe next room that some visitors are allowed access to is entirely different from the first. There are gorgeous Renaissance paintings on the walls, framed with ornate gold decoration and lit up with individual lights. The rug is lush, and the room is impeccably clean. \n\nFinally, when visitors are invited to meet with the Grand Chairman, they must enter a balcony area located in the interior of the warehouse. There is a frosted glass door with the Grand Chairman\u2019s name on it. On the lower floor, there is a laboratory that is visible from the balcony. The lab contains advanced equipment that is not available anywhere else in the world. It also houses an atomic reactor that is shielded by a bluish-green invention that is about an inch thick The shield is semi-transparent but also incredibly strong. Beneath the balcony, down a steep flight of stairs, there is a gigantic computing machine. Everything that goes on in the POSAT building must remain confidential, and very few individuals are told the secrets of the ancient society. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The primary setting in this story is that of the POSAT headquarters. Hidden in a back alley in a warehouse district, it proved hard to find for Donald when he was invited for an interview. In this same warehouse are a number of businesses, including a pharmacy where POSAT places Bill with a job. The first room in the POSAT headquarters is a dingy waiting room, which acts as a facade or screening room of sorts so that they do not show their hand to people they are not sure will want to enter the organization. The real waiting room is a gorgeous, ornate room with Renaissance paintings on the walls, part of the personal collection of POSAT's founder. There was a beautiful rug on the floor, some filing cabinets, and some curious fluorescent lights that seemed more advanced that Donald figured possible. Past this room, the Grand Chairman has an office that is also ornate, with a frosted glass door, but between this office and the waiting room there is a balcony. This balcony acts like a bridge between the two rooms over a laboratory. This laboratory is visible from this walkway and is full of extremely advanced technology that Donald is not able to identify by sight, as it is beyond its time. Even the glass-like substance acting as a shielding window between him and the laboratory is too thin to be a substance known by his contemporaries.  ",
        "Summary_3": "The story centers on three main characters who separately discover the advertisements of the POSAT in different locations. Bill Evans discovers it while reading through a magazine left on a bus seat. Elizabeth Arnable finds the advertisement in the Antivivisectionist Gazette, which she reads in a room with her many cats and a radio. Don Alford receives his invitation to meet with the Grand Chairman of POSAT, which is located nearly one hundred miles away from his home. The POSAT headquarters calls a giant, sprawling warehouse home. The concrete, windowless warehouse covers an entire city block and also houses a printer's plant, upholstering shop, and a pharmacy where Bill Evans finds new employment. Several alleys make way for loading platforms at various locations around the warehouse as well. Don Alford finds the entrance to POSAT at the back of an alley, and he enters through a frosted glass door and walks up a dark, murky stairwell to a dingy reception room. The room Don enters beyond the reception area, however, is ornately decorated with rugs and paintings from the Renaissance periods. Bright tubes light the paintings from above, which astonishes Don because they are neither battery-powered nor wired to anything. His meeting with the Grand Chairman of POSAT takes place outside the room with the paintings on a balcony overlooking the vast warehouse interior. Looking out upon the warehouse floor, Don observes several men appearing to conduct experiments in some kind of laboratory populated with scientific instruments he has never before seen (except for an atomic reactor obscured by a bluish-green plastic). At the bottom of another flight of stairs, Dr. Crandon shows Don the world's largest computer, which was used to analyze his questionnaire results and may be used to predict and motivate human behavior.",
        "Summary_4": "What is POSAT? by Phyllis Sterling Smith takes place in several different settings. However, much of it takes place in the POSAT headquarters itself. A long dark stairway leads to the receptionist\u2019s room. It\u2019s dusty and a little unattractive, but the window that lets in sunlight helps hide that fact. The waiting room is grand and luxurious, filled with ancient, Renaissance paintings and ornate gilding. The paintings were lit up from the bottom by contained radioactive lights. The headquarters has a laboratory in it as well, filled with previously uninvented equipment, such as an atomic reactor. Scientists and worker bees are hard at work, studiously bent over their equipment. In the basement rests a supercomputer equipped with the ability to understand humans based on their answers to multiple-choice questions or the papers they write. "

Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Mr. Crandon is a member of POSAT, and he is also a professor, published author, and researcher. Don admires Mr. Crandon as an intellectual before he realizes that Crandon is also the Grand Chairman of POSAT. When Don finds out that Crandon is a member of the secret society, he is shocked. Don knows that Crandon is a highly intelligent person, and POSAT seems like a scam. When Crandon explains the truth about the ancient society, its history, its goals, and its ability to pick the finest individuals to join its ranks, Don listens carefully because of his prior connection to Crandon. Had the Grand Chairman been a complete stranger to Don, he might have written the entire experience off as a manipulative scheme or a simply impossible endeavor. After one short conversation and a tour of the building, Don is willing to join POSAT as a member. Crandon is a persuasive salesman and a true believer in the organization and its goal to make a more civil society. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dr. Crandon contributes two major things to this story. The first is that he was Donald Alford's mentor as a research scientist, so he was in no small part responsible for Donald's training, giving him the tools he needed to do the research he was doing at work and could be doing with POSAT. The other major role that he plays is that of Grand Chairman of POSAT. Not only is he in charge of the organization as a whole, but he is the one who explains the history and the goals of the organization to the scientists that are recruited. ",
        "Summary_3": "Dr. Crandon is a research physicist and former professor of Don Alford. When Don first discovers the POSAT ad, he is reading a research paper by Crandon in The Bulletin of Physical Research. Crandon's instruction grounded Alford in the mastery of and commitment to the scientific process and thereby contributed to his skepticism regarding POSAT's promise of mystical wisdom. Therefore, Don is shocked to discover the Grand Chairman of POSAT is Dr. Crandon himself. Crandon delineates the history of POSAT as a hundreds-of-years-old organization meant to preserve and advance the knowledge and discoveries of its founder. The discoveries run the gamut of technology, mathematics, and physical science and pre-date contemporary discoveries such as atomic reactors by centuries. As Crandon explains, these discoveries have been kept secret because humanity could not be trusted to use them responsibly. In the meantime, POSAT has developed a massive computing machine that can analyze human behavior to determine motivations and predict reactions to certain events and knowledge. Crandon hopes that by joining POSAT, Don can use his knowledge of physics to contribute to their mission and, eventually, peacefully introduce their discoveries to society.",
        "Summary_4": "Dr. Crandon was a professor at a university that Donald Alford once attended. As a fellow scientist, he wrote several research papers and was even published in scientific journals. Donald Alford was reading his latest scholarly journal article when he came across the advertisement for POSAT. It\u2019s clear that Alford admires Dr. Crandon both as his former student and as a scientist. It is later revealed that Dr. Crandon is in fact the Grand Master of the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth. He is not the founder, however, but he serves his organization with pride. Alford\u2019s curiosity, scientific attitude, and admiration for Dr. Crandon were several factors in his admittance to joining POSAT. "

After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he\nsaw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the\nblue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the\ntiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could\nhardly have been fifteen.\n  \n \n  The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious\ndisappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These\nare thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension,\nand impulse traveling\u2014a result of the unusual stresses of the time.\nFinally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe,\nespecially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods'\nand in some way responsible for current events.\n  \n \n  \"It is thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining\ncasually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over\nfor him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced,\n\"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of\npomegranate juice.\n  \n \n  The monkeylike figure muttered, \"Scotch-and-soda,\" then turned toward\nEdmund and asked, \"And what is your reaction to all this, sir?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth, POSAT, is an ancient secret society. It was founded by a genius of a man who lived during the Italian Renaissance, roughly 400 years ago. The founder was a mathematician and scientist, and he invented calculus, created the quantum theory of light, and wrote Maxwell\u2019s equations. However, he did not get credit for any of these ideas. He also designed the atomic reactor that Don sees in the laboratory of the building. The founder understood how dangerous the atomic bomb was, and he did not want to give his peers the tools to create such a powerful weapon. He did not trust men who were at war with one another over political power. Still, he did not want his knowledge to vanish when he died, so he created POSAT. He was willing to share his scientific and mathematical secrets, but he did not wish for untrustworthy people to get their hands on the information until it would be safe to do so. The founder also wanted POSAT to work towards a more peaceful society where everyone could be trusted to share knowledge and information without the fear of it leading to catastrophic events. \n\nIn the centuries since the society was founded, the members have invented new tools and technologies that are not available anywhere else in the world, like the atomic reactor shield and the lightbulbs that hang above each Renaissance painting in the waiting room. Yet, the secret society\u2019s main goal is to create a civilized society, not new inventions. In an effort to make that vision a reality, members of POSAT created a very large computer that seeks to decode human motivation. The computer used Don\u2019s multiple choice questionnaire to determine that Don would be a good fit for the society because he is trustworthy. Although it seems like POSAT should involve more renowned scientists and peacekeepers to make sure it accomplishes its mission, it must also guard all of its secrets, and in an increasingly surveilled state, that would be nearly impossible to do while also including great thought leaders. \n",
        "Summary_2": "POSAT, or The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth, is a secret society that considers itself \"ancient and honorable\", which has been active since the Renaissance Era. They put ads in magazines to attract new members, stating that anyone can unlock the key to life through their pamphlets. The organization is led by a Grand Chairman, a spot currently filled by Dr. Crandon. When the organization was founded in the Renaissance Era, some four hundred years before the time in which the story takes place, the technology did not exist to act on the founder's theories. For instance, the atomic reactor that powers the headquarters has only been in use for twenty years, but was designed four hundred years ago. This was how the founder operated, well ahead of his time, developing ideas in the physical sciences far past what anyone would have expected, even of a genius. He donated a number of paintings from his personal collection, so much of the contemporary headquarters has his mark on it, even from an aesthetic standpoint. ",
        "Summary_3": "POSAT was founded four hundred years prior to the events of the story by a genius mathematician and physical scientist and a group of fellow \"brilliant men\" capable of advancing his scientific discoveries and committing them to secrecy. The founder lived during the Italian Renaissance and used his own mind to invent and discover, among other things, calculus, the quantum theory of light, the theory of relativity, wave mechanics, and nuclear reactions. The founder realized mankind was not able to wield this knowledge responsibly, so POSAT was designed to withhold this information until the time came in history when they could be trusted with it. POSAT operates its headquarters in a large warehouse, in the center of which is a large lab full of researchers where Dr. Crandon oversees the continuing work of the founder. The warehouse also houses businesses like the pharmacy that employs desperate people like Bill Evans, who turns to POSAT as a last resort, and the print shop that publishes advertisements that reach people like Elizabeth Arnable, whose belief in mysticism borders on religious.",
        "Summary_4": "The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth was founded four centuries ago by a genius. He discovered radioactivity and nuclear bombs hundreds of years before the rest of the world, designed the atomic reactor, invented calculus, and more. Impossible things that have yet to be discovered or invented in the 21st Century. The idea behind POSAT was to keep this man\u2019s inventions a secret from the rest of the world, as well as continue making such amazing technological advances. \nSo, POSAT continued as a secret society, committing members who were dedicated to maintaining secrecy and developing ideas and theories that could be used to save the world, not harm it. They are currently dedicated to discovering more about the human motivation and how it can be used to perpetual world peace. This way all discoveries that are made in the future (however dangerous or wonderful they may be) will not be used to incite war, human disaster, or violence. \n"

Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\nreceiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\nstanding or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\nthe training.\n  \n \n  He hoped they were right.\n  \n \n  The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\nwasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\nshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\nship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\n   \n   ended\n   \n  , nor did it\nmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But it is not\u2014not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\nlogic\"\u2014the Tr'en word seemed to mean\n   \n   right-saying\n   \n  \u2014\"who will advise\nthe Ruler. They will be called.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\nthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\ngestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n  \n \n  The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\nus,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"\u2014\n   \n   chulad-like\n   \n  Korvin\ntranslated\u2014\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin devoutly hoped so.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Bill and Elizabeth are minor characters in the story, but they are key in demonstrating how POSAT\u2019S recruiting efforts work. Bill, Elizabeth, and Don all see the same magazine advertisement and decide to send their coupons in the mail and receive an informational pamphlet in return. Bill is motivated by his desire to change his life. He has lost his job and feels useless and dejected. Elizabeth wants to join the ancient society because she truly believes it can offer her profound wisdom. She also believes that her cats are her family members reincarnated, so she\u2019s clearly a gullible person who hopes to find magic and miracles in her everyday life. Don is curious about the advertisement, and as a naturally skeptical person, he assumes it\u2019s all a hoax.\n\nPOSAT\u2019s correspondence with the three highly different individuals starts out the same, but after gaining a little bit of insight into each person\u2019s background, job, religious beliefs, and motivation for joining the society, the people at POSAT individualize Bill, Elizabeth, and Don\u2019s responses. Bill receives a pamphlet with vague answers to life\u2019s problems, while Elizabeth gets literature about topics like the sacred cats of ancient Egypt. She is also offered an official membership to the group and told to contribute $5 per month. Don, however, is given an in-depth psychological exam. \n\nTowards the end of the story, Mr. Crandon reveals how POSAT\u2019s magazine advertisements work to attract people to the secret society. The new supercomputer they have invented has created the perfect combination of intrigue, symbolism, and promise of knowledge to get the right peoples\u2019 attention. Don, for example, was immediately taken by POSAT\u2019s logo, although he could not explain why. When people like Bill and Elizabeth apply to become members, they are pacified through other means. Elizabeth is an example of a religious fanatic who contributes to the society financially while also feeling deeply satisfied at her inclusion. Bill is an example of someone who is desperate and wants to try to join the society as a way to change his life.  Since POSAT wants a more civilized and peaceful society, they work with those people by finding them new jobs or renovating their homes. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Bill Evans is a pharmacist who does not currently have a job, and is hesitant to fill out the long form he was given in return for his request for a POSAT booklet. Elizabeth Arnable, on the other hand, is overjoyed to have the chance to talk about herself and send in the form, providing much more information than was requested of her. Not only do the two different people allow the reader to see that POSAT sends different responses in the mail to different people, but we learn at the end of the story that these different people play different roles in the organization. Neither Bill nor Elizabeth will contribute scientific knowledge but each have their place in the organization. People like Elizabeth, for instance, are kept interested with various pamphlets, and contribute to the organization if they want to--Elizabeth asks how much dues are, so she is given the chance to contribute financially. Bill, on the other hand, is someone who looks to the organization as a last resort, so POSAT takes advantage of the opportunity to study human motivation, practicing their newly developed theories by providing Bill with a pharmacy job and keeping an eye on him. ",
        "Summary_3": "Bill Evans is an unemployed pharmacist, who turns to POSAT as a last-ditch effort to escape the financial ruin of his current situation. He discovers an advertisement for POSAT in a copy of Your Life and Psychology on an empty bus seat, and writes in to get more information on its promise that its secrets can \"alter the course of your life!\" Likewise, Elizabeth Arnable discovers the advertisement in a copy of Antivivisectionist Gazette, a magazine she reads by chance despite the fact that she rarely reads and prefers listening to the radio with her cats. Most likely due to the fact that she believes her cats are reincarnated family members, the vague mysticism of the advertisement attracts her, and she immediately wants to become a POSAT member. Although this same messaging disappoints Bill, he is pleased that around the same time that he receives his information packet from POSAT, he receives a job offer at a pharmacy that shares the same building as their headquarters. Elizabeth receives pamphlets of information about the sacred cats of ancient Egypt, a POSAT membership pin, and details about membership fees. Later, Dr. Crandon explains these fees are collected from people who view their POSAT membership with religious fervor to cover operational expenses. The pharmacy where Bill Evans works was built in an effort to employ those who turn to POSAT out of desperation, and there they become the subjects of covert rehabilitation to help them reenter society using POSAT's knowledge and discoveries.",
        "Summary_4": "Bill and Elizabeth are two other people who responded to the POSAT ad in a magazine. They are examples of the two other things that may happen to people who apply to POSAT, but are not the correct person to get in. \nBill was down on his luck and searching for cosmic change. He needed a job, a better life, and he needed it fast. He responded to the advertisement as his last hope and was disappointed to only receive a metaphysical text in return. However, he was also offered a job at a wholesale pharmacy right next to the POSAT headquarters. Dr. Crandon later reveals that they give back to the world by finding housing, jobs, and more for people down on their luck who apply to POSAT in the hopes of a change. \nElizabeth, on the other hand, is a completely different applicant. She was interested and enthralled by the idea of a secret society, but wouldn\u2019t actually be qualified to join or dedicated to the task at hand. So, POSAT enrolled her, but only sends pamphlets that she would be interested in. For example, they sent her a pamphlet about Egyptian cats, since she had mentioned her cats in her original letter to POSAT. Since she asked about dues, they asked her to contribute $5 monthly which she will do happily. \n"

        "Query": "What is the story I, the Unspeakable about?",
        "Article": "The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight\n   \n   short\n   \n  days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his\nmother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed\nrapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\n  \n \n  Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence\nwas a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age\nan inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\n  \n \n  Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his\nfather now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\n  \n \n  This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every\nsecond of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\n  \n \n \n   Because in a few hours they'd be dead.\n   \n \n \n  This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal\nstate hadn't he dreamed of\n   \n   long\n   \n  lives, valleys not of blasted stone\nbut green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then\nthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long\nlife? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and\ndepressing in eight short, vanishing days?\n  \n \n  How had his people gotten into such a condition?\n  \n \n  As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n  \n \n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n  \n \n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n  \n \n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n  \n \n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n  \n \n  His mind flexed.\n  \n \n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n  \n \n  The cliff groaned.\n  \n \n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n  \n \n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n  \n \n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n  \n \n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n  \n \n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n  \n \n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n  \n \n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n  \n \n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n  \n \n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n  \n \n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n  \n \n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n  \n \n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n  \n \n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n  \n \n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n  \n \n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n  \n \n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n  \n \n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n  \n \n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n  \n \n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n  \n \n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n  \n \n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I can't take the time to explain it all. I have too much to do. Just\nthree of us\u2014myself and my two sons. My wife lost her mind. I should\nhave helped her as I'm helping you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Harry said. \"I remember people, and things, and\nwhere are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the time,\" the doctor repeated, voice rising. \"I have to run\na world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, but\nhow large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. The\npeople calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving me\nmore money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyone\nelse, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable to\nreach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should have\nknown they would.\"\n  \n \n  Harry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines?\n  \n \n  \"You survived,\" the doctor said. \"Your wife. A few hundred others in\nthe rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived because\nI lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting the\ncatastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living to\nsurvive.\" He laughed, high and thin.\n  \n \n  His son said, \"Please, Dad....\"\n  \n \n  \"No! I want to talk to someone\n   \n   sane\n   \n  ! You and Petey and I\u2014we're all\ninsane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land,\nany land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surrounded\nby people who are sane only because I made sure they would know\nnothing.\" He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. \"Now do you understand?\nI went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Most\nwere farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway.\nBecause farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later.\nI put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section of\nthe country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gave\nyou back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because we\ndon't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with big\ncrops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all,\n   \n   sanity\n   \n  ! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peace\nand consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....\"\n  \n \n  He choked and stopped.\n  \n \n  Stan ran across the room to the switch.

He recounts his time as a conformist citizen of Northem, a futuristic dystopian civilization: one day, he wakes up and regards himself in the mirror, observing signs of aging on his face. He sees the toll of the past two years, since the renumbering. \nThe narrator explains that, as part of ensuring the efficiency of Northem, the designation of each citizen is periodically changed. In the most recent one, everyone was assigned six numerical digits and a prefix or suffix of four letters, which often spelled something pronounceable \u2013 for the narrator, the four letters spelled an unspeakably vulgar word. As a result, the narrator is forced to infract from his job and assume non-productive status and begins encountering difficulties in quotidien tasks, such as receiving his realfood package. Furthermore, his designation prevents him from acquiring gainful employment and reassuming productive status, as well as the ability to mate. \nThe narrator then recounts hearing the woman\u2019s voice for the first time. She encourages him to change his name, a difficult thing to do because of its implied criticism of the state. The voice returns in his sleep, nearly every night. Driven by his loneliness and social ostracization, the narrator brings himself to the Govpub Office, a sort of government center, in an attempt to change his designation. \nIn the underground office of his local Govpub Office, the narrator navigates his way to the Numbering and Identity section with help of a cyb, an automated assistant. In the round room that is the Number and Identity department, he observes a remarkably attractive woman at the information desk. Though he is nervous at first, fearing that he will have to share with her his embarrassing name, he dismisses his hesitance and approaches her. He reluctantly shares his name, and asks that she direct him to information concerning state serial designations. \nAs the girl, whose name she reveals is LARA, leads the narrator to information bank 29 where the requested information is stored, they share an inappropriate moment: Lara trips and the narrator grabs her arms. Lara\u2019s demeanor changes, and she now conducts herself in an all-business fashion. At bank 29, Lara explains to the narrator the tasks he must complete in order to change his name, including traveling to the capital. On their way back to the main room, the narrator makes a joke which elicits a laugh from Lara. As she enters the rotunda, she abruptly stops laughing. The narrator, following closely behind, quickly realizes why: two Deacons, officers of the state, are at the central desk. \nOn the night before his departure to the capital, the narrator once again hears the mysterious female voice in his head. She tells him that he is attracted to Lara. On the transport to the capital the narrator sees a young couple holding hands, and pictures himself with Lara in their position.\n",

And two years ago when he got his name, it was so unusual and embarrassing that no one even wanted to pronounce it. And the name is the reason he lost his job; it is the reason that he cannot get a woman who would agree to mate with him. He was okay at first with this N/P (Non-Producer) status, however, later he realizes that the boredom of being a N/P is too much. He goes looking for jobs. However, it disappointed him again. When the employer hears about his specialty, they look very delight. However, when he hands them his tag with his name on it, they always tell him that they will call if anything turns up. But just like what happened with the Eugenic Center, no one called.

At the N. & I. he gets attracted to the information desk girl, L-A-R-A 339/827. He asked her for information regarding how State Serial, thus the names, are assigned, and how they can be changed. After hearing his name, she is a bit shocked, but then she decides to help him out. Then later she points out that he needs to get a travel permit in order to get to Opsych, The Office of Psychological Adjustment. Apparently, Opsych is the only place that can authorize a change to the State Serial.

        "Summary_1": "Northem, one of the two superstates of the world and home to the Narrator, is ruled by the State. It is highly efficient, and allocates alphanumeric designations to its citizens to be used as names. In the most recent renumbering, the State assigns the narrator an unspeakable four-letter designation. \n\tThe State, through its officers the Deacons, enforces norms of acceptability. These norms include the ranges of physical attractiveness within which women are required to stay, the flat tone of voice in which citizens must speak, and the facial expressions citizens are allowed to display. Additionally, the State regulates sexual behaviour: mating is only allowed in Eugenic Centers, and those who infract upon sexual norms are sent to a prison planet called Marscol. \n\tThe State further regulates the allocation of realfood, such as eggs, which is a valuable commodity. When the balance of trade between Northem and Southem, the other superstate, fluctuates, more or less realfood becomes available. Non-productive members of society, so long as they are conformists, or loyal members of the state, are cared for by the State.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The State is currently ruling over Northem. They\u2019ve set rules that must be followed by the citizens, those that infract and do not obey will be send to Marscol. Those that follow the rules, the states will provide food to them. Thus, the State cultivate and organize conformists, and tell them to obey rules. Moreover, because the old designations were not efficient, and there are more than two billion people in Northem. Thus the State has decided to introduce a new renumbering system that would be benificial to both the Northm and the Southem. Thus everyone was renumbered. They each receives a six digits along with four digits of prefix or sufix. \n\nFurthermore, the State favors short and succinct languages. It prefers efficiency. They changed the numbering system because it was not efficient; the boss was trying to ease the main character out because he desired an efficient organization; the cyb asked for efficient words when the main character was the Govpub Office. \n\nAlso, there had been political differences between the Northern and Southern states. During those times, they each spread longitudinally across the globe. While not in war currently, both of the states are geared up for it. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Northem acts as the moral, civilized, and orderly opposition to the Southem. The State helps to enforce this order and civility, primarily by the renumbering of its citizens. This structured system of naming attempts to place citizens on similar levels and address each other formally. To challenge this naming system would be to question the authority of the State. Society is also divided into Producers and Non-Producers; the Non-Producers are seen as draining of the Northem, reinforcing productivity as a defining value of the State. The State also aids in enforcing mating regulations; the narrator notes that pre-atomic civilization had free mating, where public affection and partnership was common; however, mating is now a State-regulated activity as provided by Eugenic Centers.",
        "Summary_4": "The citizens of Northem are conformists that dare do not go against the State nor criticize the State. The State regulates nearly every aspect of a person\u2019s life. The State of Northem is in charge of renumbering, assigning a work designation, food allotments, sleeping arrangements, and mating abilities for its citizens. Renumbering is claimed to help the war-type struggle against Southem. With the new designation, every person was assigned six digits and four letters as a prefix or suffix. "

        "Summary_1": "The narrator, who was designated an unspeakably vulgar four-letter designation during the last renumbering, has been negatively affected by his new name. Because of its distracting effect on those who learn it, he is forced to resign from his job studying magnetic mechanics and assume non-productive status, which in turn hampers his ability to acquire realfood. Theoretical research which the narrator privately conducts could not be published. His designation further prevents him from participating in group games at the rec center, special interest clubs, and State Loyalty chapters. The narrator is unable to mate since, at the Eugenic Centers where mating is regulated by the State, he must submit an application which must be approved by women who are authorized to mate with him.",

Secondly, he can hardly join group games at any of the rec centers.

Moreover, because he is at N/P status, he cannot even get his order because the distributer tells him to get to the end of the line. And the food packages never reachese the end. Lastly, he cannot mate, no one at the Eugenic Center would even bother to call him back after hearing his name. No woman would want to mate with him. Thus, he feels terribly lonely. ",
        "Summary_3": "The narrator's name makes it difficult for him to lead a normal life, and instead makes him very lonely. At the beginning of the story, the narrator's chief lets him go from his place of employment, because of the difficulties that his name brought to the workplace. He has trouble getting a new job, despite his impressive expertise, because of his name. This makes the narrator stuck in the Non-Productive status, which interrupts his everyday life, including on realfood day, joining games and clubs, and even being unable to publish anything with his name on it. These difficulties also apply for mating; the narrator is unable to find a partner and finds himself extremely lonely. ",

People seem to not want to associate with him due to his name. He loses his job because of his name, though the manager does not directly state that it is the reason. People do not want him to join their group games, clubs, or State Loyalty chapters and his research is unable to be submitted for publication. Because people have adverse reactions to his name, the narrator is lonely due to the lack of his social life. In addition, because of his name, the narrator is not able to mate with a woman. His inability to find a woman that will mate with him creates a longing and a desire for him to mate with a woman. "

        "Summary_1": "Typically, people are unwelcoming of the narrator upon learning his name. During his job search, he is welcome in virtue of his previous experience in space drives, but is quickly dismissed upon sharing his name. In submitting his application to mate at a Eugenic Center, the clerk dismisses the narrator\u2019s chances of finding a mate with a reminder that the women are able to refuse. Lara, the information clerk at the department of Numbering and Identity, is taken aback and hesitates in recording the narrator\u2019s personal information. \n",
        "Summary_2": "People around the narrator are embarrassed to even utter his name. When he reports his name to his chief of his past job, his boss was speechless, and definitely was feeling awkward. He did not give the name to the secretarial engineer, who usually takes care of the names. Instead, he went directly to the administrative circuits. Later, the boss asked him to resign, simply because of his name. Moreover, when trying to get hired for other jobs, upon hearing his name, the employer would react with confusion, and they would try to be polite and say that they will call if any thing turn up. The women at the Eugenic Center have similar reactions. They would be embarrassed, and then tell him that they will call if anything comes up. But they never do. At monthly realfood day, he can hardly get the package because the distributor sees his post and realizes that he is a Non-Producer, they would tell him to go to the end of the line, where the food never gets there. Even Lara was a bit shocked, and she has to take some time to recover. ",
        "Summary_3": "Upon hearing the narrator's name, people are shocked, and sympathetically try to ignore it. Firstly, when the narrator first reports his name to the chief, he reacts silently and refuses to share it with anyone else. The chief then does not refer to the narrator by his name, instead calling him by nicknames. When the clerk at the Eugenic Center hears the narrator's name, he coughs awkwardly and reminds the narrator that women have the right to refuse entering the mating booth with him. When Lara hears the narrator's name, she tries to hide her reaction and looks down, but takes longer to record it.",
        "Summary_4": "People have various reactions when they hear the narrator\u2019s name. When he first reports his name to his chief, the chief does not respond directly and instead becomes red in the face and chokes from the shock. Individuals at the different bureaus during his search for a job are excited when they learn of his job specialty, but lose their delight when they see his name on his name tag. A clerk at the Eugenic Center reacts to the narrator\u2019s name with surprise and becomes uncomfortable, shown by his fidgeting and coughing that follows hearing the name. In general, many people have an uncomfortable reaction to his name and have to take a second to process it and recover from their reaction. "

        "Summary_1": "Gregory Malcolm is a secretary to J. Foster Andrews, the wealthy leader of the Galactic Metals Corporation. In the control room of Andrews\u2019s space yacht the Carefree, Sparks, the radioman, fails to downplay the seriousness of their situation to Malcolm: the Carefree has been sucked into an unpredictable vortex and the fate of the ship and its occupants is uncertain. \n\tMalcolm approaches the dining room, where Andrews and members of his family are enjoying breakfast. He is unnoticed by his employers, but takes note of Andrews\u2019s beautiful daughter Crystal and her betrothed Ralph Breadon. Suddenly, Andrews calls Malcolm over to complain about the honey and to enquire about the state of the Galactic market. Malcolm, in virtue of the fact that the vortex has blocked communication to and from the Carefree, is unable to answer. Crystal asks Malcolm if they are in danger, but before he is able to answer the question, Crystal\u2019s older brother Bert enters drunkenly and suggests that they are doomed. \nSparks abruptly enters the room and confirms Bert\u2019s drunken suspicion: they have been caught in a gravitation downdraft and must evacuate to a life skiff. On the skiff with members of the Andrews family, Sparks, a cabin-boy, and Breadon, Malcolm navigates above a celestial body and observes the crash of the Carefree. Just as Malcolm surrenders control of the skiff to Breadon, its engines engage and they quickly fall towards the planet. Breadon deftly manipulates the controls, and they land safely. As Malcolm quickly congratulates Breadon on his landing, the latter blames and berates the secretary for the fall. The cabin-boy, however, points out that Breadon\u2019s sleeve was responsible for their descent. \nMalcolm and Sparks examine the damage to the skiff, and Sparks shares his frustrations about Malcolm\u2019s submissive, secretarial behaviour. Malcolm concludes that they are on a rarely-visited, unpopulated, vast, and dangerous moon of Saturn called Titan. Malcolm resolves not to tell the Andrews, fearing that the information would only make them panic. Meanwhile, the Andrews family are in disarray over how best to remove necessities from the skiff.\nBreadon delegates to Sparks the role of establishing communication. Sparks, however, responds poorly and reveals that they are on Titan, and that their chances of rescue are dim. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Gregory Malcolm is the secretary of J. Foster Andrews, a wealthy man in charge of the Galactic Metals Corporation. While aboard their ship, Hannigan, a radio operator and companion of Malcolm, discloses that they have entered a vortex and remain trapped with no transmission or radio signal. Hannigan advises that Malcolm doesn't tell the Andrews family and instead waits until there is more information. Malcolm enters the dining dome, where the Andrews family sits, including Crystal, their daughter who Malcolm admires, and Ralph Breadon, her suitor. J. Foster asks Malcolm for information about the corporation's business, to which Malcolm is unable to answer due to the lack of radio transmission. The Andrews family notices the odd situation outside the ship's port and questions Malcolm further, but a drunk Bert Andrews interrupts, panicking and revealing the dire situation at hand. Malcolm reassures the family that there is no immediate danger yet, but Hannigan then enters, urgently yelling at everyone to board the life skiff due to emergency. The team runs to the life skiff, where Malcolm and Hannigan frantically operate it until Breadon insists on taking over. Breadon gains control but the life skiff still faces danger, and as Malcolm and Hannigan scramble over the controls, Breadon steers the life skiff onto the ground; the team survives but the skiff is wrecked. Breadon blames Malcolm for the crash, and Malcolm leaves the situation alone, which Hannigan discourages. After inspection, Malcolm determines that the team has crashed on the planet Titan.",
        "Summary_3": "The story starts with Hannigan trying to tell Greg that the atmospherics don\u2019t need to be worried, these are not worth reporting to the boss. However, Greg has studied astrogation and is sure that they are in a vortex. He knows that they have been in the vortex for more than eight hours, but he has no idea how much longer nor how far the ship will go. Agreeing not to tell the boss, Greg goes upstairs to the dining room. Right after he arrives by the door, J. Foster Andrews of Galactic Metals Corporation, starts calling him. He comes in and is asked about the transmission, which he says that there is none. Before he has time to finish explaining himself, Bert Andrews, one of J. Foster Andrews\u2019 son, came in and told everyone that they have been in the vortex for a long time, and they could crash at any moment. J. Foster then turns to confirm with Greg, who explains that it is indeed true, only a bit exaggerated. However, Hannigan comes in and rushes everyone to get on Number Four life-skiff. They are about to crash. \n\nThey all rush to the life-skiff. And Breadon, the person that J. Foster Andrew daughter\u2019s engaged to, tries to get the control from Greg. And in the middle of this, someone hit the control-keys and the motor is killed. Then all of a sudden, Greg, Breadon, and Hannigan all try to reach the control. However, in the end, it is the Breadon that performed the miracle in saving all of them. Later Greg and Hannigan goes to check the ship while others are all doing their own things. Looking around, Greg realizes that they are on Titan, one of Saturn\u2019s satellites. Then Breadon orders Hannigan to send an SOS message to the nearest space cruiser. Hannigan asks Breadon, mockingly, what he should use, and if he knows where they are at. Breadon got stuck with so many questions coming at once, then it is Greg who said: they are on the northern hemisphere of the satellite. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins with Sparks and Malcolm discussing their predicament on the ship Carefree. The ship is trapped in a vortex that has blown it off course. Malcolm goes to the rotunda where food is being served to the Andrews family. The Andrews family is surrounding the table, including Crystal, who Malcolm fancies. After some loud talking from the family, eventually, Greg informs them that they are in an ionized field and the transmission does not work. The family becomes quite concerned at the news. The son of Andrews, Bert, walks into the doorway in a drunken manner. He tells everyone that they should be concerned. While Malcolm is trying to calm the family down, Sparks runs into the room yelling at everyone to head towards the life skiff. There is a mad rush towards the life skiff that caused a lot of confusion. The Carefree bursts into flames and Malcolm says that he is unsure if the other skiffs were able to escape in time. \n\nMalcolm is piloting the ship when Breadon commands him to hand over the controls. When he does, Breadon\u2019s sleeve brushes against the control keys causing the motors to be turned off. Many people rush to fix the skiff, but Breadon is ultimately the person who guides the skiff to the ground. Breadon yells at Malcolm for interfering, but the cabin boy, Tommy, defends Malcolm. Breadon continues to belittle Malcolm. Sparks tells Malcolm that he is strange and he needs to defend himself against Breadon. \n\nEveryone disembarks from the ship. Bert tries to give orders, but the orders seem to be nonsensical. Malcolm is the first person to realize where the group has crash-landed. Breadon then commands Sparks to send an SOS message. Sparks mocks him by questioning how he should send a message and where he should say they are located, knowing that Breadon does not have the answer. Breadon is not able to specify exactly where they are located. Malcolm completes an experiment that is able to narrow down which hemisphere of the satellite they are located in, displaying a skill that Breadon does not possess. Maud Andrews is inquisitive of how Malcolm could have possibly been able to know where they crash-landed. \n"

        "Query": "Who was on the life skiff with Gregory Malcolm during the events of \"Wanderers of the Wolf Moon\"?",
        "Article": "It was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\n  \n \n  And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n  \n \n  \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\n  \n \n  What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\n  \n \n  The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\n  \n \n  In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\n  \n \n  Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\n  \n<doc-sep>Hannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n  \n \n  \"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. The kid was right, you know.

Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\n   \n   anything\n   \n  .\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Malcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\n  \n \n  Sparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff.

Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\n  \n \n  J. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\n  \n \n  Greg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\n  \n \n  Maud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n  \n \n  \"Is there anything we can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n  \n \n  \"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n  \n \n  \"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\n   \n   quick\n   \n  ! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Those next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\n  \n \n  He was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\n  \n \n  J. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\n  \n \n  Then the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\n  \n \n  Sense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\n  \n \n  Somewhere in space. He looked through the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  . What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Like a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\n  \n \n  For an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  ; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  was accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\n  \n \n  And Greg Malcolm turned from the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , shaken.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\n  \n \n  Then a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>It was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\n  \n \n  And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n  \n \n  \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\n  \n \n  What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\n  \n \n  The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\n  \n \n  In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\n  \n \n  Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Gregory Malcolm is a secretary to J. Foster Andrews, father of Crystal Andrews, who is promised to Ralph Breadon. Malcolm is attracted to Crystal, and dislikes Breadon\u2019s appearance, though he admires it as well. In the life skiff, Breadon behaves in a domineering manner towards Malcolm, suggesting that he hand over the controls of the skiff. During the transfer of controls, however, Breadon\u2019s sleeve is caught on a switch and causes the skiff to crash towards Titan. During their descent, Malcolm attempts to control their trajectory but is dismissed by Breadon, who successfully lands the skiff on the moon of Saturn. Malcolm quickly congratulates Breadon, but is berated for interfering. Despite this, however, Malcolm later rationalizes Breadon\u2019s arrogant behaviour and maintains to Sparks, the radio engineer, that he holds no grudge against him, seemingly hiding his anger behind his job as a secretary. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Malcolm and Breadon have a tense relationship. Malcolm is enamored of Crystal, and admires her beauty and loveliness. However, Ralph Breadon is Crystal's lover, which sets a competitive tone between the two. Malcolm is jealous of Breadon, not only because of his relationship to Crystal but is also threatened by him and his appearance. Their competitive nature is seen in the story, particularly when Breadon overtakes Malcolm's control of the life skiff; the two bicker and fumble over the control of the aircraft, and the life skiff ends up crashing onto Titan. Malcolm commends Breadon for keeping the members alive, but Breadon blames him for the crash, though it was his own sleeve being caught on the control that caused it. Though Malcolm and Breadon have problems with each other, Malcolm is more obedient and tries to avoid additional conflict. ",
        "Summary_3": "We learn from the beginning of the story, Crystal, J. Foster Andrews\u2019 daughter, is engaged to Breadon. However, Malcolm seems to like her as well, but there\u2019s nothing he can do. Later when Malcolm is talking about the phenomenon of the vortex, Breadon is the first that realizes what Malcolm is implying with the ionized filed. Then, when Hannigan tells them to board the life-skiff, both of them are able to get on it. Malcolm has the control of the life-skiff at first, but then Breadon asks to take over. Just as he is doing that, his sleeve catches the control key and turns the engine off. The ship begins to lose control, and Breadon grabs everyone\u2019s hand off the control except for his. With his skills and training, finally, he is able to land without injuring anyone. Greg is surprised, since he did not believe they could actually be saved. He complements Breadon \u201cnice work,\u201d but Breadon blames him for crashing the ship. So then Hannigan decides to stand up for Malcolm where he asks Breadon if he know which part of what planet they are on. Breadon stuttered, and then Malcolm simply stated that they are on the northern hemisphere of Titan, one of Saturn\u2019s satellite.",
        "Summary_4": "Gregory Malcolm is described as tall and neat, wearing a business suit. He is the secretary of J. Foster Andrews. Ralph Breadon is a socialite and sportsman with previous training as a pilot. He is described as a sturdy man with eyes, hair, and skin the color of chestnuts. Crystal, Andrew\u2019s daughter is pledged to Ralph Breadon. Malcolm is attracted and has feelings towards Crystal, the girl that is meant to be with Breadon. Breadon belittles Malcolm throughout the story. Malcolm does not respond with disdain or anger towards Breadon, instead, he remains calm and obedient. He acknowledges that Breadon has some competencies and skills related to piloting. Malcolm eventually proves to the group that he has more knowledge than Breadon when he is able to approximate their location on Titan. "

        "Summary_1": "Generally, the Andrews family is dismissive of their household staff, which include Gregory Malcolm, \u2018Tina Laney, Sparks, and a cabin-boy. J. Foster Andrews, the head of the family, impatiently calls for his secretary, Gregory Malcolm, to complain about the quality of their morning honey. J. Foster learns that Malcolm doesn\u2019t know that state of the Galactic market, but dismisses the reason that Malcolm provides, instead concluding that the radio technician Sparks is drunk. \n\tDuring the evacuation to the life skiff, Crystal Andrews, J. Foster\u2019s daughter, remembers her maid \u2018Tina Laney and asks where she is, apparently paying mind to her safety. In contrast, her fianc\u00e9 Ralph Breadon is dismissive of Malcolm, and later blames him for the life skiff\u2019s crashing into Titan. Upon the cabin-boy\u2019s revelation that it was, in fact, Breadon who inadvertently caused the skiff\u2019s malfunction, Breadon strikes the cabin-boy. \n\tOn Titan, \u2018Tina is instructed to remove things from the skiff by the women of the Andrews family, who do not help, and Sparks and Malcolm are harshly instructed to make themselves useful. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Andrews family resembles a royal one; they are wealthy and own the monopoly of Galactic Metals Corporation, with over ten thousand employees. The Andrews family is aware of their wealth and power, and treat their employees as significantly inferior to them. They also believe that any problems that arise are due to their employers, and insist that their products are perfect enough to not be subject to any problems. This is shown in the story when Malcolm first sees the Andrews family to update them on the situation at hand, and J. Foster Andrews expects his workers to be able to resolve the issue themselves. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Andrews family seem to have different attitudes towards their employees. Through the first part of the story, we see that at first J. Foster Andrews is not paying much attention to Greg, who is his employee, even when speaking with him. J. Foster Andrews simply replies \u201cfine\u201d to Greg\u2019s answer of no transmission. Then he realizes what Greg is actually saying and then without allowing Greg to explain what he means by no transmission and how it has happened, he continues to scold them and order Greg to do things. Maud Andres tells him to stop and lets Greg explain himself. Greg on the other hand is very polite. He greets the Andrews family when entering the dining room, and thanks Miss Andrews for letting him to explain himself. On the contrary, later in the story, Breadon does not thank Greg even when he complements Breadon, instead, Breadon just accuses him for the crash just because he touched the control. But still, Greg is being very polite and calm, and it is in strong contrast to Breadon\u2019s anger and rudeness. Lastly, in the end, the readers see that Maud Andrews, the sister of J. Foster Andrews, is very surprised when she hears that Greg knows where they are. ",
        "Summary_4": "J. Foster Andrews employs around ten thousand people for his Galactic Metals Corporation. He is described as Napoleonic, especially when talking towards his employees. He is loud and demanding towards Malcolm and interrupts him many times when he speaks. His sister Maud even remarks that he has to give Malcolm a chance to respond. Maud inquisitively judges Malcolm and the other employees. When the ship is about to crash and everybody is rushing towards the life skiff, the Andrews family has more regard for their pets or fights than for saving others on the ship. \n\nAndrew continuously commands orders from his employees and has no patience for anything but extreme obedience from them. The rest of the family continues to demand the employees take after them once they leave the ship after their crash landing. They are more concerned about their own comfort than the well-being of the employees. Both Ralph and J. Foster take action trying to one-up one another in an attempt to show their power over their employees. Neither wants to be a fool. At the end of the story when Malcolm is able to approximate their location, Maud, a member of the Andrews family, is taken aback by Malcolm's discovery. She reacts as if she is surprised an employee could be smart.\n"

        "Article": " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep>Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n",

Outside of the Carefreem is a dynamic, glittering web of bright violet light, in stark contrast to the typical black of space. \n\tAs the members of the Andrews family and their household staff escape the Carefree onto a life skiff, the setting changes to the atmosphere of the moon Titan. Now free of the vortex which caused the shimmering lights, the space around their skiff is dark. \n\tAfter their uncontrolled descent onto Titan, the passengers of the skiff find themselves at the foot of a ring of shallow mountains, standing on rough soil. The mountains above are green and lush, with periodic caves along their face. In the sky is an image of Saturn, which causes the gravitational pull on the planet to be similar to Earth\u2019s. More broadly, Titan, the moon they are on, is uninhabited and rarely visited. \n",

The crew eventually crashes onto the planet Titan, a mountainous, green, cavern-filled planet, though threatening in its uncertainty and lack of colonies.

Once they get on to the life-skiff, however, because Breadon accidentally hits the control keys with his sleeve, which turns of the motors and they go directly towards the ground. Luckily Breadon is talented and skilled, he is able to perform the miracle that makes the life-skiff bounced and finally landed, without injuring anyone. Even though the life-skiff is a bit broken, it is not too big of a deal.

One evening, Cassal is warned by Dimanche, an informative electronic companion, that he is being stalked by a man. The man's motives are not completely known, but according to Dimanche, the man is intending to murder Cassal. One thing is known, which is that the man's objective is related to Cassal being stranded on Godolph. As it begins to rain heavily, Cassal attempts to evade the man with the help of Dimanche; he follows a Godolphian girl and turns into an alleyway. As they pass by the man, Dimanche notes that he is becoming increasingly suspicious. Cassal leads the man into an alleyway, and as the dusk turns to darkness, Dimanche assists him in dodging and fighting the man. With a lighter-turned-knife, Cassal is able to attack the man and stab him several times. According to Dimanche, the man is presumed dead, although moments later the man strangles Cassal and steals his wallet. The next day, Cassal visits the Travelers Aid Bureau, where Murra Foray, the First Counselor, prods him for information, including why he is on his way to Tunney 21. Avoiding the question, Cassal asks about the status of the next ship to Tunney 21. He learns that the ship departed from Godolph that morning, and that someone named Denton Cassal did board it; he then realizes that the man who attacked him the night before used the identification from his wallet to board that ship. Stranded and uncertain of how long he would have to wait for another ship, Cassal is out of options. He contributes a donation to the bureau as he leaves. Dimanche reports that he tried to gather information on Foray, but only got her home planet, as electronic guards were blocking the rest of the information, which Dimanche finds suspicious.

        "Summary_3": "Denton Cassal is a sales engineer who was selected to see a man at Tunney 21. The story starts with Dimanche talking to Cassel where Dimanche is warning him that there could be a stalker who is harmful to him. After further analysis, Dimanche believed that the guy stalking him had murder in mind. Dimanche is a device that is designed on Earth and it\u2019s able to analyze people. Then the readers learn that Cassal is on Godolph, a transfer center for the stars that are located near the center of the Galaxy. And Cassel is here to transfer from Earth to Tunney 21. He was supposed to get on the ship after a few days of landing in Godolph, but apparently the ship has not arrived and it has been almost three weeks. Hearing Dimanche\u2019s analysis on the man\u2019s connection to the delay, Cassal gets curious. \n\nThen Cassal is suggested by Dimanche to follow a girl in order to get closer to the stalker. Then he gets to a deserted intersection holding his cigarette so that the guy will follow, which he does. Because Godolphian won\u2019t be seen when it\u2019s dark, but they can see Cassal very well, so Dimanche becomes Cassal\u2019s eyes once they entered the intersection. Cassal listens to him and follows his instructions. Luckily he is able to get the distance correct to injure the guy. Right after that, to Cassal\u2019s surprise, Dimanche detects no heartbeat and the guy is not breathing anymore. Despite that he is horrified by the fact he has just murdered someone, Cassal wants to figure out who wants the man to attack him. So he looks through the man\u2019s wallet and other personal items, but could find no connection. Then suddenly the supposed-to-be-dead man attacks Cassal and then runs away with his wallet. \n\nLater, Cassal found himself inside the travelers aid bureau answering questions in order to get a consultation. During the consultation, he realizes that he just missed the ship. Moreover, someone used his identity to get on to that ship. Then, Murra Foray, the first counselor of the travelers aid bureau offers him help if he donates to them. He is surprised by the amount they wish for, but he donates anyways. Then after he exits from the other side of the building, he sees a man who finishes with putting up the signs. But somehow he would not talk about Murra Foray as if he is afraid of her, which Cassal does not understand at all. ",
        "Summary_4": "On the planet Godolph, Neronics, Inc., salesman Denton Cassal is being stalked by a mysterious local. An intelligent implanted machine able to detect and interpret physiological data of nearby individuals, which Cassal calls Dimanche, tells him that the man likely intends to murder him. Dimanche gathers that the assassin's motivation is connected to Cassal\u2019s being stranded on Godolph; Cassal had initially meant to stay in Godolph for only a couple days before continuing his journey to Tunney 21, but has been stuck there for several weeks. \nCassal moves closer to the man in order for Dimanche to better analyze him; Dimanche reveals that the man wields a concealed knife. Instructing Cassal to turn into an alley, Dimanche learns that the man expressed regret about having to kill Cassal, saying that one of them had to die. Suddenly, the assailant rushes Cassal, who narrowly dodges and deploys a hidden blade. Dimanche guides Cassal, whose eyes are unable to see in the dim Godolphian light, in a fight against the man, and Cassal seemingly dispatches the man. However, he quickly recovers and tackles Cassal, managing to steal his wallet and identification tab before running off. \n\tNow at the Travelers Aid Bureau, where an old technician is changing signs throughout the building, Cassal waits to enter a counseling room to ask about his onward journey to Tunney 21. Through a screen, he speaks with Murra Foray, who asks that he complete an onboarding questionnaire. He answers all the required questions, except for one which asks for his purpose in traveling to Tunney. We learn that Cassal aims to persuade a Tunnesian scientist to come to Earth in order to develop instantaneous radio, which would make them very wealthy. \n\tMurra reveals that the transport for which Cassal had been waiting had departed that morning, and that a man named Denton Cassal had been aboard it. Cassal concludes that his assailant from the previous night had stolen his identification tab with the intention of traveling to Tunney 21. Murra understands Cassal\u2019s situation, and elicits a contribution from him in exchange for the Travelers Aid Bureau\u2019s assistance. Throughout their conversation, Murra seems to bait Cassal into revealing his secret to success as a salesman; because of his possession of Dimanche, Cassal is able to successfully interpret his customers\u2019 reactions. However, Cassal is wary of Murra\u2019s line of questioning and reveals nothing. \n\tAs Cassal leaves the counseling room, he runs into the old man changing the signs, who reveals that Murra has recently assumed control of the Bureau. Cassal sees that the technician is afraid of Murra, but thinks nothing of it.\n"

WALLACE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by SIBLEY\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   An unprovoked, meaningless night attack is\n    \n   terrifying enough on your own home planet, worse\n    \n   on a world across the Galaxy. But the horror\n    \n   is the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n  \n \n  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep>Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\n  \n \n  The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\n  \n \n  Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\n  \n \n  The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\n  \n \n  It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\n  \n \n  He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n  \n \n  \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\n  \n \n  The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\n   \n   did\n   \n  the\nthug want?\n  \n \n  Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\n  \n \n  And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n  \n \n  \"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\n  \n \n  He adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain.

        "Summary_1": "Dimanche is a device attached to Cassal's ear that is able to collect physiological data on a person, including nervous systems and physical reactions to stimuli. In addition, Dimanche is able to understand what people \"subvocalize\", or think to themselves in their subconscious. In the story, Dimanche's abilities are shown when he is able to read the thoughts of Cassal's attacker as well as his body's reactions to Cassal's movements, such as his heart rate and blood pressure. Dimanche's features also give Cassal an advantage in his work as a salesperson, as he is able to gauge people's thoughts, motives, and desires. Dimanche is a secret kept from the rest of the galaxy, and Cassal is hesitant to tell others about his abilities.",
        "Summary_2": "Dimanche is an electronic instrument that was invented on Earth. Cassal refers to Dimanche as a device. It is a secret instrument that very few know about. It has the ability to scan the nervous systems of individuals at short distances to collect and interpret data. He is used in the story to analyze the data that he collects from people nearby to complete a report of what a person says and thinks inside of their head. ",
        "Summary_3": "Dimanche is a device invented on Earth to help Cassal analyze people. Dimanche is first used to help Cassel notice a man that is stalking him, Dimanche gives his analysis and interpretations about that man, confirming his intention. Dimanche believes that there is some connection between the delay in the transit ship to Tunney 21 and the stalker. So Cassal decides to let the guy find him and see what he is trying to do. When the guy tries to hurt Cassal, Dimanche helps him to fight the man since Cassal cannot see the guy after dark. With Dimanche\u2019s information, Cassal is able to stab the guy. Then he realizes that he has accidentally killed him after Dimanche found no heartbeat and he is not breathing. But neither Dimanche nor Cassal is aware of their ability to pretend to be dead. So before Cassal could react to Dimanche\u2019s warning, he gets hit and his wallet is stolen by the guy. \n\nLater at the travelers aid bureau, we learn that Dimanche is quite crucial to bring the researcher back to Earth. Moreover, Dimanche thought there\u2019s something weird about the Murra Foray, the first counselor of the travelers aid bureau, but he could not identify anything else before  the electric guards slide into place.

        "Summary_4": "Dimanche is a device implanted next to the bone behind Denton Cassal\u2019s ear which is able to detect various things about people in proximity to him. Among these things are heart rate, neural index, mental state, and motivation. An intelligent machine, Dimanche is also able to determine any concealed weapons, and can silently communicate with Cassal. Dimanche is an example of the advanced technology of Earth, and Cassal hopes to demonstrate it to a scientist on Tunney 21 to convince him to join Neuronics Inc., in developing instantaneous radio. \n\tCassal employs Dimanche\u2019s capabilities several times throughout the story, often without giving explicit instructions. It is first employed in assessing the mental states and likely motivations of Cassal\u2019s assailant. Dimanche is able to locate the assailant when Cassal\u2019s eyes, in virtue of the poor lighting, could not, and is able to communicate his location to Cassal. Later, Dimanche is used in the Traveler\u2019s Aid Bureau to gather information about Murra Fora, but, as it reaches her, electronic guards prevent it from gathering any information other than her planet of origin. \n"

The man would work towards the company's goal of developing instantaneous radio; this radio system would impact the entire galaxy, technology that could share information with every planet with no time delay.

If Earth can get his help, then Earth will have perfect instantaneous radio that span the whole Galaxy. Because of its monopoly in instantaneousness and vastness, Earth can literally set its own price.

This way he can also gain profit from the instantaneous radio which will be build afterward.",

Neuronics aims to monopolize the technology and amass great wealth, from which Cassal would receive a commission.\nCassal, because of his possession of Dimanche, an intelligent implant capable of determining the thoughts of those nearby, is in a good position to negotiate terms with the scientist for two reasons: firstly because he will be able to guess the Tunnesian\u2019s price, and secondly because Dimanche\u2019s sophisticated technology will convince him that Earth is an advanced civilization.\n"

He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n<doc-sep>The woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n  \n \n  \"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\n  \n \n  She nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\n  \n \n  He stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n  \n \n  \"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\n  \n \n  Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n  \n \n  \"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n  \n \n  \"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\n  \n \n  He got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\n  \n \n  A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n  \n \n  \"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\n  \n \n  The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "Murra Foray is the First Counselor of the Traveler's Aid Bureau on Godolph. Little is known about her personally, other than the fact that she is a Huntner, a people from across the Galaxy. Foray was an intimidating, cold woman, who was particularly curious about Cassal. Upon Cassal's arrival, she interrogates him about his personal life before offering help. Additionally, once Cassal realizes he had missed the ship to Tunney 21, and is stranded on Godolph, Murra Foray offers little support or sympathy. Instead, she reprimands him for lack of identification and nevertheless presses for a financial contribution. Foray is a mysterious character, whose motives are questioned, especially by Dimanche; while Dimanche is usually able to read people, Foray had electronic guards protecting information, indicating that the Traveler's Aid Bureau is hiding something.",
        "Summary_2": "Murra Foray is the First Counselor at Travelers Aid Bureau. She is significant to the story because Cassal goes to her for help because he is unsure where the ship is that is supposed to take him to Tunney 21. She is described as being cool, clean, and with bright eyes. She is possibly younger than Cassal. Murra informs Cassal that without his identification card, no ship would be willing to let him board as identification is necessary to leave the ship in the region that Tunney 21 is located. She describes the Travelers Aid Bureau as a philanthropic agency that can help him solve his issue, for a price. She informs him that they will keep him informed. \n\nDimanche assesses Murra and claims that she is a Huntner, which is a sub-race of men that are located on the other side of the galaxy. Dimanche was not able to gather more information because she was blocking him from collecting data. After Cassal questions an old man about Murra, he receives a jarring reaction that he waves off without concern. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Murra Foray is the first counselor of the travelers aid bureau, she looks enigmatic and dangerous. At first, she is doubtful about Cassel\u2019s destination to Tunney 21 and his occupation as a sales engineer. She points out that there are a thousand races, how is Cassal able to have special knowledge of all those different types of customers. \n\nLater she tells Cassal that his ship has already left in the morning. And no one is sure when the next ship will be coming to Godolph. Murra suggests five years if lucky. Star hopping would also take that much of time since he has only covered one third of the whole distance. Then later Murra realizes that someone has already boarded the ship under Cassal\u2019s name, using Cassal\u2019s identification. Now the stalker\u2019s motive of stealing his wallet becomes clear. Then Murra suggests that he donate to the bureau so that they will help him with his special case, which he did. Afterwards, Dimanche suggest that Murra is a Huntner. But before Dimanche can learn anything else, the electronic guards stopped him. Outside the building of the bureau, Cassal learned that even the old man switching the signs on the building is afraid of Murra Foray. ",
        "Summary_4": "Murra Foray is the new first counselor at the Travelers Aid Bureau on Godolph. She is a Huntner, a sub-race of humans from the other side of the galaxy. First appearing on a screen in a Bureau counseling room in which the protagonist Denton Cassal enters, she asks him to fill out a questionnaire. Cassal is unable to determine her age, but comments that she is taller than average, lean, and has a broad face that narrows at her chin. \n\tMurra asks Cassal why he has not answered the question about the purpose of his onward journey to Tunney 21, and speculates that it is to recruit a scientist for his company. She reveals to him that the transport for which he had been waiting had already departed, and offers her help in arranging alternate transportation to Tunney. She elicits a monetary donation from Cassal before terminating their conversation. \n\tAs Cassal leaves the counseling room, he encounters an old technician who seems afraid of Murra. \n"

But the horror\n    \n   is the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n  \n \n  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR\n  \n \n  By DONALD E.

He threatened\n    \n   to destroy everything that was noble and\n    \n   decent\u2014including my date with my girl!\n   \n \n \n \n  When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken\negg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window\nsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry\nlist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put\nthe roof on the city, as they say.\n  \n \n  It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're\nlucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n  \n \n  But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been\nbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my\nmind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this\nmorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her\nplace. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the\nphone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten\no'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n  \n \n  Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a\nharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a\nfixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,\nof course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,\nwere invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one\nwaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other\nProject and had blown itself up.\n  \n \n  Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three\nyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,\nshortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five\nminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been\nkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from\narriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had\nhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four\ndays.\n  \n \n  And then the elevator didn't come.\n  \n<doc-sep>The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye\nand grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n  \n \n  \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous\nobserved. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\nto time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n  \n \n  Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked\nfor the dispatch clerk.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that\ncontingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT\ntransports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.\nHas it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n  \n \n  Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.\nBut there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed\nclear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and\ntake a look at that baggage for me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand.

Something funny going on.\nGuns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,\nI'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a\nfriend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you\nunderstand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that\nwill cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n  \n \n  Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down\nto the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  Karsh met Retief as he entered the Departures enclosure at the port.\n  \n \n  \"What's going on here?\" he demanded. \"There's some funny business with\nmy baggage consignment. They won't let me see it! I've got a feeling\nit's not being loaded.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd better hurry, Mr. Karsh,\" Retief said. \"You're scheduled to\nblast off in less than an hour. Are the students all loaded?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, blast you! What about my baggage? Those vessels aren't moving\nwithout it!\"\n  \n \n  \"No need to get so upset about a few toothbrushes, is there, Mr.\nKarsh?\" Retief said blandly. \"Still, if you're worried\u2014\" He turned to\nArapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"Hank, why don't you walk Mr. Karsh over to the warehouse and ...\nah ... take care of him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know just how to handle it,\" Arapoulous said.\n  \n \n  The dispatch clerk came up to Retief. \"I caught the tractor equipment,\"\nhe said. \"Funny kind of mistake, but it's okay now. They're being\noff-loaded at d'Land. I talked to the traffic controller there. He said\nthey weren't looking for any students.\"\n  \n \n  \"The labels got switched, Jim. The students go where the baggage was\nconsigned. Too bad about the mistake, but the Armaments Office will\nhave a man along in a little while to dispose of the guns. Keep an eye\nout for the luggage. No telling where it's gotten to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here!\" a hoarse voice yelled. Retief turned. A disheveled figure in a\ntight hat was crossing the enclosure, arms waving.\n  \n \n  \"Hi there, Mr. Gulver,\" Retief called. \"How's Boge's business coming\nalong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Piracy!\" Gulver blurted as he came up to Retief, puffing hard. \"You've\ngot a hand in this, I don't doubt!

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place in a city on Godolph, a planet that acts as a transfer location in between stars. Godolph is a threatening and violent city, not safe for ordinary humans. A unique feature of Godolph is that its environment is specifically catered to natives, where the weather is controlled, often with heavy rain. The city is compared to Venice, where water is used as a mode of transport and essential to engineering. Additionally, at dusk the city becomes dark for travelers, but bright for its natives. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on Godolph, in a Godolphian city. Violence occurs in these cities and they typically shut down at dusk. Being a human pedestrian at night is not a safe option. Cassal is on Godolph as it is in between Earth, which he left, and Tunney 21, where he intends to go. He describes Godolph as a backwards planet.  As Cassal is walking on the street, there is a tide of water that is used by Godolphian\u2019s as a transportation network. He is walking in the rain as that is the type of weather preferred by Godolphian\u2019s. \n\nCassal heads down an alley at the direction of Dimanche. The alley is narrow and dark with a slow-moving, oily type of water jutting from one side and large walls standing overhead on the other side. \n\nEventually, Cassal finds himself at the Travelers Aid Bureau. The building is shaped like a square block. The Bureau was similar to a maze inside with many small counseling rooms. A\n\nCassal is only 1/3 of the distance to Tunnel 21. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set at the place called Godolph. Godolph is the place that travelers transfer from a star that is located further from the Galaxy to the stars that are located near the center of the Galaxy. The story follows Cassal as he walk to the deserted intersection to fight with the guy since Dimanche suggests that there is a connection between him and the delay in his ship. After fighting with the guy, he gets the guys wallet but loses his. Without his identification, he comes to the travelers aid bureau. Here he has to answer questions in order to get a consultation. And during the consultation he learns about missing the ship and about someone who boarded the ship using his identity. Then the story ends with him walking out of the bureau building and asking an old man about Murra Foray, but apparently he is too afraid to answer him. ",
        "Summary_4": "The first scene of the story takes place on the poorly illuminated streets of the planet Godolph. The natives of the planet have sensitive eyes, and as a result the streets appear dimly lit for human eyes. It rains often on Godolph, whose climate is controlled by its amphibian inhabitants who are fond of rain. A means of transportation on Godolph is the transport tide, rapidly moving water which carries Godolphian natives to their destination quickly and quietly. In the scene where Cassal is confronted by an assailant, there is oily water moving on one side of a narrow alley, and high walls on the opposite side. \n\tThe second half of the story is set in the labyrinthine Travelers Aid Bureau, whose busy corridors are pocketed with small counseling rooms. In each counseling room is a small door into which visitors can deposit contributions to the agency. \n"

I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He\nrolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the\nevening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\n  \n \n  As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\n  \n \n  She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n  \n \n  \"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n  \n \n  \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her\nshoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n  \n \n  She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Following World War III at the end of the 20th century, American society is dependent upon a machine created by the Thinker's Foundation; this machine, named Maizie, has the ability to answer any question posed to it, and it is used often by politicians and public figures for societal decision making. Jorj Helmuth, a Thinker with hypnotic abilities, awakes with a girl, Caddy, asleep beside him. Jorj is struck with a revelation about new developments in his work towards space domination, and he sends a letter to a group of physicists calling for a meeting later that afternoon. Jorj is then alerted that the President has arrived to consult Maizie. He commences the daily procedure of feeding the machine questions through a tape, and meanwhile attention turns to a broadcast of a rocket taking off to Mars. The Secretary of Space, who joined the President, is wary of his exclusion in this project, but disregards it as he credits Maizie for the decision. Jorj discloses that the Thinkers plan to find ways to gain access to and control of Martian minds. As Maizie begins answering questions, one of them sparks curiosity, asking whether Maizie is short for Maelzel. The machine responds with \"no\" as the officials are perplexed by the question, which references a character in a story by Edgar Allen Poe in which a machine was found to be fake and operated by a man. Apparently, the question came from a member of Opperly's group, a team of physicists; Jorj advises that the issue be looked into. Later, scientists Opperly and Farquar discuss the previous events. Opperly says that he covered for Farquar, who submitted the question, but still disagrees with his decision to dig at the Thinkers. Farquar believes that the Thinkers, along with Maizie, are fakes and ought to be exposed. Farquar and Opperly go back and forth, debating whether or not exposing the Thinkers is worth violence or energy, when Farquar receives a message from Jorj regarding the meeting about his space project. Opperly is skeptical of Jorj's motives, but Farquar plans to go anyway. On his way home, Jorj ponders the future of the Thinkers with excitement, eagerly awaiting a future where they would be on the same level of the Scientists, and where they would build the true Maizie.",
        "Summary_2": "In an alternate history of America, wherein World War III has occurred, Jorj Helmuth wakes up and turns off the device which enables him to learn in his sleep. Jorj is a forty year old Thinker, a class of individuals who work with the US government on various projects, such as monthly rockets to Mars and a super-intelligent computer Maizie. As Jorj prepares for his day, he receives a call from the President, who is waiting to see Maizie. \nMaizie, a large computer with large panels, controls, indicators, and terminals occupies a two-story room in the Thinkers\u2019 Foundation, in which the President and members of his cabinet are waiting. It is described as many times more intelligent than humans, and was built by the Thinkers despite the skepticism of cyberneticists and scientists. The president, his secretary, two generals, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Space regard Maizie with reverence, speaking in hushed tones for fear that it could overhear them despite the knowledge that it only receives input from the ticker tape fed to it. Jorj enters onto the tape questions from the officials, before noticing an errant question, which he learns is from Morton Opperly\u2019s group of physicists. He feeds the tape to Maizie, which begins to emit a noise indicative of the start of its processes.\nAs they await Maizie\u2019s answers, Jorj directs their attention to a television screen broadcasting the launch of a rocket to Mars. We learn that Martians have imparted profound wisdom through the Thinkers to the world, which still suffers from the effects of the third world war. In response to the President\u2019s wish that Martians be brought to Earth to directly share their mental science, Jorj reminds him that only the Thinkers\u2019 minds can safely interact with the Martians\u2019. \nThe narrator reveals that inside Maizie is, rather than complicated machinery etching the edges of molecules to store information, a man who manually answers the input questions. He pauses when he reaches the question from Opperly\u2019s group, which asks if Maizie stands for Maelzel. He types out a response in the negative and continues. It is also revealed that the rocket launched for Mars only travels acutely beyond the ionosphere, rather than to its advertised destination. The astronaut, who is accompanied by his cat, reads about the knowledge which he would pass off as Martian wisdom upon his descent to Earth. \nMaizie has returned the output tape, and the Secretary of Space wonders aloud who Maelzel is. One of the generals recalls that it is from a story about a chess automaton inside which was actually a man. They dismiss Opperly\u2019s group as confused. \nIn Opperly\u2019s residence however, Opperly and Willard Farquar discuss the Thinkers\u2019 deception. Though Farquar aims to reveal the sham, Opperly is unsure he will succeed, citing that people want to be told what they wish were true. Farquhar receives an invitation from Jorj, which they surmise is because of a demand for rockets in the near future.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set after World War III. Jorj is a Thinker that occasionally uses hypnotic control on a girl named Caddy to make her agreeable with him. The Thinkers have made big claims that they have achieved great technological feats. They claim that they have created a cubic brain-machine that is intelligent and knows everything. They say the machine event helped finished building itself. They also have claimed that they have nuclear powered Mars rockets. This too is not true. They send a person to space pretending that the person is headed towards Mars, when in reality that person will be circling the Earth for two months. Not everyone knows of the lies, the President and secretary of state do not. \n\nDuring a review of the tapes for Maizie, the group comes across an unusual question asking about Maizie. Jorj finds out that the question was written by Opperly\u2019s group. Opperly and Farquar are two scientists that know of the Thinkers deception. Farquar is the one who wrote the question, to Opperly\u2019s dismay. Caddy was previously with Farquar, before she went with Jorj. \n\nOpperly and Farquar disagree over how they should respond to the Thinker\u2019s deceptions. Farquar wants to act with violence to continue to try to expose them. Opperly reasons that they tried to expose the Thinkers before and nothing happened, so they should cut their losses. Farquar suggests that the Thinkers are vulnerable because their technology does not exist and it would be easy to attack them. Opperly is concerned that the Thinkers may be able to buy Farquar off if they offer Caddy back to him. \n\nAt the end of the story, Jorj has plans to make sure the Thinkers no longer have to use deception. He excitedly thinks of how the Thinkers can build the true Mars rocket and even perhaps the true Maizie and goes to sleep with these thoughts in his mind. \n",
        "Summary_4": "After waking up, Jorj Helmuth, a Thinker, sends a message to Farquar and the other professionals so that he can get help in building a rocket. He states that he has funds from the government and wishes to work together. Importantly, the girl, who is sleeping next to Jorj, is controls hypnotically by Jorj, and she is somehow connected to Farquar. \n\nThe president then shows up waiting to see Maizie. Standing before the two stories high electrical brain, he feels like he is seeing the actual God. Not only does he feels so, the generals wonders if this is the Second Coming, the Secretary of State feels the power and respect in wisdom that this machine has, the Secretary of Space is relieved that the Thinks are the ones who built it rather than the professional physicists who does not get things done but simply tell you how things should be done. While surprised at the question that the Opperly\u2019s group asked, Jorj simply entered all the questions for Maizie to solve on the tape. Then he suggests that the government officials should watch the takeoff of the rocket that is going to Mars. While the Secretary of Space is somewhat angry at Jorj for not even informing him about the spaceship, he tells himself that the Thinkers had rescued him from breakdowns and will be bringing mental discoveries from Mars. \n\nAs Maizie continues to work, the readers learn that there is actually a person that work on the questions as they enter into Maizie. He reads the questions and write down their answers. Interestingly, he also notices the question from the Opperly\u2019s group. It makes him somewhat angry. After the rocket goes into space, Jorj gives the answers that are produced by Maizie to each government official. Then we learn that the Opperly\u2019s group is asking about Maelzel. Maelzel was a chess playing machine that was proven to have a man hidden inside it. Later we learned that the Opperly\u2019s group knows that Maizie also has a man hidden in it, and they wanted to tease them. Which is why they wrote the question. Apparently they succeeded, since the question got Jorj angry.\n\nWe then see two physicists, namely Opperly and Farquar, arguing over whether the world needs a magician or a physicist right now when the invitation that Jorj previously sent arrives. Opperly is suspicious of the invitation and what they will do to Farquar, mentioning the girl that ran off with a Thinker. Indeed, Jorj is not only thinking of building a Mars rocket, he also want to have other things built such as Maizie, so that the Thinkers will be farther ahead from with the scientists. But Farquar does not think so."

        "Query": "What is the significance of Maizie in Appointment in Tomorrow and how does it operate?",
        "Article": "The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\n  \n \n  Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\n  \n \n  The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\n  \n \n  Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\n  \n \n  The burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\n  \n \n  Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\n  \n \n  From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\n  \n<doc-sep>Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\n  \n \n  Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\n  \n \n  Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n  \n \n  \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\n  \n \n  Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\n  \n \n  Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\n  \n<doc-sep>Meanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\n  \n \n  He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\n  \n \n  For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\n  \n \n  Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\n  \n \n  The question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\n  \n \n  He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he began to tape again.\n  \n \n  \"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\n  \n \n  But his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Maizie is a large contraption that occupies a room in the Thinker's Foundation. It consists of various controls, cables, and synapses, more than the human brain. It reads questions through information fed on a tape. Once Maizie processes the questions and conjures up answers, it delivers information back through a man who translates the tape into an answer. The main point regarding Maizie is that little to no one knows how it truly works, which is why it is regarded even by the President as a superior guide for intelligence. Maizie appears to be intimidating with its incomprehensible parts and gadgets, but the process in which it delivers simple answers to questions allows the public to trust it with decisions.",
        "Summary_2": "Maizie, which is regarded as a super-intelligent computer capable of answering complex problems about governance and political strategy, is in fact merely a unit housing a man who manually answers the questions posed to the machine. Jorj Helmuth, a member of a group called the Thinkers, inputs questions onto tape which are fed to Maizie, and the tape rolls along inside the machine and emerges in the room containing the man. He tapes out answers, which are output and given by Jorj to those who asked the question. \nThis deception is a common strategy of the Thinkers, who have also faked travel to Mars, among other inventions. However, they hope to one day be able to construct all those things in order to stand on equal footing as scientists.\nMaizie is a means by which the Thinkers have influenced politics, and through which they have acquired power. It is hypothesized by Opperly, an elderly physicist, who knows how Maizie works, that the success of the deception is a result of their era, which yearns for fantastical solutions. The decision to reveal Maizie to the world is a topic of conversation between Opperly and a younger member of his group, Willard Farquar, who wants to expose the machine. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Maizie is a brain machine built by the Thinkers. The Thinkers publicly claim that is a million times more synapses than a human brain. They say that Maizie has incredible intelligent capabilities. The reason Maizie is significant to the story is that Opperly and Farquar reveal how Maizie is actually fake. Someone records the answers for Maizie to recite. The Thinkers came into power because they were able to present incredible feats of technology like Maizie, but the technology turns out to not actually exist. Jorj Helmuth claims to be the mind that is behind the \u2018mind\u2019 of Maizie. ",
        "Summary_4": "Maizie is supposed to be the thinking machine that has a million times more synapses than human brains have. It should take in the questions by humans entering it on the tape, and report answers back. Maizie was set up to work for the humans or the right-minded leaders of humans. However, Maizie does not work the way that the government believes it does, or the way that the Thinkers want them to believe. Instead, there is literally a fat man sitting in the middle of the room, he looks through the tapes that are sent in to his room and then writes down the answers to each of those questions. To the government officials, this is magical and believable, and they take advises from the machine. However, apparently the physicists knew the actual way that Maizie works, they do not want to be fooled and teased the Thinkers by sending them a question. On the question, it asks if Maizie stands for Maelzel. Maelzel is a chess playing machine that turned out to have a man inside it, exactly the same with Maizie. While the government officials did not seem to understand the mockery in it, the Thinkers did."

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\n  \n \n  It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\n  \n \n  Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\n  \n \n  Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\n  \n<doc-sep>Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\n  \n \n  Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\n  \n \n  Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n  \n \n  \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\n  \n \n  Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\n  \n \n  Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Thinkers are magicians who dominate the current society. When America was in crisis post-World War III, they provided solutions to problems and questions, and acted as a more structured, moral, \"human\" group for leadership than physicists prior. The Thinkers are the creators of Maizie, a brain-like computer that answers any question; Maizie is used by many in government to make drastic decisions with the goal of preserving humanity. The Thinkers are also working towards a larger plan of moving their work to Mars, ultimately dominating Martians the same way they dominated Earth. There is also controversy surrounding the Thinkers, mainly from the Physicists, who believe that their work relies on the desperation of society and is fraudulent.",
        "Summary_2": "The Thinkers are a group of individuals led by Jorj Helmuth. Their members include Helmuth, a man who is an intermediary between government officials and the Thinkers\u2019 super-intelligent machine Maizie, Tregarron, the man inside Maizie who produces its responses, and an unnamed astronaut who the world thinks travels to Mars and returns with Martian wisdom, when in fact he merely floats in the upper atmosphere. \nThe Thinkers have deceived government officials, including the President of the United States and his cabinet, with the use of Maizie, a machine which is advertised as being able to solve complex problems of every type. In fact, Maizie is operated by a man who writes its responses. The story revolves around an interaction between the President, his cabinet and Maizie; a discussion is also had between two physicists, Farquar and Opperly, who are aware of the Thinkers\u2019 deception but are in disagreement with one another about whether their information should be more thoroughly shared. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The Thinkers are a group of people that won a Presidential election. Farquar exclaims that their power was not earned because of their technology but because the world is not at peace. The Thinkers are significant to the story because they make many claims about their technologies and innovations. They claim they built a cube called Maizie which is a brain machine. In addition, they have told people that they built Mars rockets with nuclear motors designed by Maizie. Neither of the two inventions are true, but rather they are deceptions. Farquar calls them Charlatans for the magician-like trickery they practice. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Thinkers are a group of charlatans that tells people what they wish to hear. But because of the times that they are in, people chooses to believe in magic. As Opperly mentions, when the time is good, people don\u2019t need magicians. But when the time is bad, people would do anything just to get the magic cures. As Farquar sees, the Thinkers are simply lucky and are talented with their stage-managing skills. They uses the brain-machine to justify their guesses. The Thinkers have faked Maizie as well as rocket landing on Mars in order to have control over the government. All government officials would do exactly as what the Thinkers order them to do. However, the physicists knew what the Thinkers are doing, they know that their rocket did not go to Mars, Maizie is not a human-brain machine, and the mental science of the Martians is fake. But since they got the government\u2019s support, Jorj sends an invitation to the physicists to support Jorj and the other Thinkers in building those actual machineries. Farquar thinks he should go while Opperly suggests it might be a trap. "

        "Query": "How does Farquar impact the plot of Appointment in Tomorrow?",
        "Article": "Opperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. \"You're a strong and\nvital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires.\" His voice\ntrailed off for a bit.

He nodded curtly, face averted.\n  \n \n  \"And didn't she go off with a Thinker?\"\n  \n \n  \"If girls find me ugly, that's their business,\" Farquar said harshly,\nstill not looking at Opperly. \"What's that got to do with this\ninvitation?\"\n  \n \n  Opperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally\nhe said, \"In my day we had it a lot easier.

Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I leave that to history.\"\n  \n \n  \"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives.

A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\n  \n \n  The front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\n  \n \n  The physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\n  \n \n  The old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n  \n \n  \"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\n  \n \n  He held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going\nto have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that\nthey'll need our help.\"\n  \n \n  \"An invitation?\"\n  \n \n  Farquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious\nthough distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered\nabout my going?

Maelzel's Chess\nplayer. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed\nto play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it.\"\n  \n \n  The Secretary of Space frowned. \"Now what's the point in a fool\nquestion like that?\"\n  \n \n  \"You said it came from Opperly's group?\" Jorj asked sharply.\n  \n \n  The Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men\npuzzledly.\n  \n \n  \"Who would that be?\" Jorj pressed. \"The group, I mean.\"\n  \n \n  The Secretary of Space shrugged. \"Oh, the usual little bunch over at\nthe Institute.

Oh, yes, and young\nFarquar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sounds like Opperly's getting senile,\" Jorj commented coldly. \"I'd\ninvestigate.\"\n  \n \n  The Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. \"I will. Right\naway.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Farquar sparks the driving conflict of the story; the question he submits threatens the authority and legitimacy of the Thinkers, implying that the machine that guides society's decisions is a fake. This question disturbs the officials present at Maizie's event. Farquar also attempts to convince Opperly, a major Scientist, that the Thinkers should be exposed and called out for their deception. He is eager to take action against them. Farquar plays an additional role in the story as someone who Jorj must turn to for help; he is a skilled physician that the Thinkers need in order to develop their idea for a nuclear rocket. Farquar determines the fate of Jorj and the Thinkers as someone who both poses a threat to them and is needed by them.",
        "Summary_2": "Willard Farquar is a physicist who is a member of Morton Opperly\u2019s group. He is a large individual with strong and ugly features. He has traced the path of the Thinker\u2019s spaceship and found that, contrary to the Thinkers\u2019 claims, the spaceships do not travel to Mars. Through Opperly, Farquar submits a revealing question to the Thinkers\u2019 machine Maizie, antagonizing the Thinkers. \nIn Opperly\u2019s residence, Farquar proposes further chipping away at their deception, saying that they shouldn\u2019t avoid a task merely because of its difficulty. Opperly, who is from the previous generation of academic physicists, disagrees. Farquar condemns his generation, saying that they wasted the power of atomic energy which they could have used to influence humanity. As he is saying that the Thinkers will soon need the help of scientists to support their bluffing, an invitation from the leader of the Thinkers arrives, inviting Farquar to the Thinkers\u2019 Foundation. We learn that one of Farquar\u2019s previous love interests had left him for a Thinker. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Farquar creates a question for an examination that hints to the Secretary of State and Jorj that he knows the secret that they are hiding. He knows that Maizie is not the intelligent and amazing piece of machinery that they claim. He knows that there is a person behind Maizie that is helping to create the illusion that Maizie is an intelligent cubic piece of machinery. Farquar wants to fight in an act of violence against the Thinkers because of their deceit towards the population. He is upset that they lie about Maizie\u2019s capabilities, their Mars rockets, and their Martian mental science.  ",
        "Summary_4": "Farquar is a physicist who knows that the Thinkers do not have a real Maizie. He has sent the question about whether Maizie is a Maelzel to the Thinkers, teasing them. Farquar\u2019s argument with Opperly allow us to learn about the Thinkers and the physicists. The Thinkers have the government\u2019s control because they seems to be able to do things that the physicists are not able to, such as going to Mars, learning about their mental sciences, as well building a human-brain machine. However, we learn from Farquar that none of that is true. There is no landing on Mars, designing a human-brain machine, which is why they need the physicists help. \n\nJorj indeed decide to send an invitation to the physicists after seeing the girl that he hypnotically controls, thus the girl should be the reason that the invitation is sent to Farquar. Later we learn from Opperly that there was a girl named Miss Arkady who had been with Farquar. She could be the Caddy that Jorj mentioned. Miss Arkady apparently went off with a Thinker, and Opperly thinks that this could be the reason that they are sending this invitation to them. However, Farquar does not believe it."

Opperly acts as a rational voice, discouraging Farquar from his rebellious and violent nature, specifically towards the Thinkers. Opperly, having lived through history, is hesitant to threaten the authority of the Thinkers and instead understands that society is in need of them. He believes that scientists should not have a place in taking action and being violent, and instead should allow the Thinkers to uphold the nation. Farquar, on the other hand, is a man of action who believes the Thinkers are immoral and inauthentic. He contrasts Opperly's reasonable nature with passion and free thinking.",
        "Summary_2": "Morton Opperly and Willard Farquar are both physicists, though they hail from different generations. They share in the knowledge that the Thinkers\u2019 have deceived members at the highest level of government and have exposed them, to little success. Opperly, an older physicist from the age of academic scientists, is reserved and skeptical about future attempts to do the same. Farquar, however, is youthful and frustrated about their situation. Whereas Opperly is unable to imagine scientists such as Einstein and Oppenheimer using violence to achieve their ends, Farquar condemns them for wasting their opportunities to shape the future with their knowledge of atomic power.

Opperly\u2019s positions reflected his elderly age with his living room having books, pen and ink, and a Picasso painting.

While he does not agree with Farquar\u2019s desire to act upon their knowledge of the Thinkers\u2019 lies, he does call them animals. Farquar responds by saying that he feels like an animal because he feels trapped in a cage. Opperly believes it is not worth fighting with the Thinkers, but Farquar wants the fight and he wants violence. ",
        "Summary_4": "Opperly believes that the world needs magicians right now, not them, the physicists. In the bad times, people would go desperately looking for the magic cure, while in the good times the magicians are laughed at and physicists respected. He understands that the power of the Thinkers lies in what they do not have at the moment, which is peace, honor, good conscience, etc. Farquar on the other hand thinks that they need to perform action. Thus after overruling Opperly, Farquar and other physicists decided to send teasing questions for Maizie to answer. This question indeed got Jorj, the Thinker, unhappy, and he tells the Secretary of Space to investigate it. \n\nFarquar predicts that the Thinkers will need their help in building all those machineries that they faked. Indeed, the invitation gets to them, and it is sent by Jorj stating that they should work together, and mentioning that the Thinkers have quite a lot of government funds.

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

        "Summary_1": "The story begins with Daniel Oak going into Ravenhurst\u2019s office to talk with him about another job. Ravenhurst tells Daniel that there is an issue with the robot McGuire because the robot will only listen to Daniel\u2019s commands. This happened because of the way the robot was programmed and Daniel happened to trigger the programming that attaches the robot to whoever the first person was to speak to it. \n\nRavenhurst does not like Daniel\u2019s methods but hires him anyways to fix the situation. Daniel believes that he is hired because Ravenhurst is afraid of losing his manager position. Ravenhurst hires and sends Daniel to the planet Ceres to work with the roboticists at Viking. Daniel puts on his vacuum suit and boards a flitterboat to Ceres. The reader learns that Daniel is a double agent as he actually works for the UN government\u2019s Secret Service agency, also known as the Political Survey Division.\n\nDaniel is sent to Ceres to help with the robot McGuire. When he arrives at Ceres he is met by Colonel Harrington Brock. He goes to have a drink with Colonel Brock and they create a separate plan from Ravenhurst and team up to implement their own solution to the McGuire problem. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Daniel Oak enters the office of Shalimar Ravenhurst, the manager of the Viking Spacecraft company whom he describes as an intelligent but unlikeable man, on the planetoid Raven\u2019s Rest. Ravenhurst offers Daniel a glass of wine, and reminds him that he has caused him trouble in the past. He reminds Daniel that the MGYR-7, an advanced robot spaceship operating system capable of understanding and speaking English nicknamed the McGuire, considers only Daniel as its master, rendering it uncooperative. Because of the McGuire self-preservation directive, it doesn\u2019t allow this obedience to be erased. The most efficient path forward, Ravenhurt concludes, is to build the eighth iteration of MGYR, and he hires Daniel to expedite the process. \nDaniel leaves Raven\u2019s Rest and travels in his flitterboat to the planetoid Ceres, a large asteroid with weak a gravitational force conducive to manufacturing mainly owned by Viking, and from which it operates. Daniel is an expediter, a job which involves speeding up projects for companies who hire him. We also learn that Daniel is a member of the Political Survey Division of the UN Government, which is interested in the McGuire project. However, it is not because of its sophistication and complexity, which is similar to that of a traffic pattern control robot, that Daniel has been tasked with gathering information about the McGuire, but rather its language-processing abilities.\nDaniel describes Asimov\u2019s three laws of the robotic brain, which in summary direct the machine to obey human beings. However, because of the difficulty in defining a human being, the first six iterations of the McGuire have failed when conflicting directions are given. Only in the seventh iteration, when the McGuire is directed to regard only the person to first give it instructions as its commander, does the machine achieve any success. \nLanding on Ceres, Daniel is greeted by Colonel Harrington Brock, the head of Ravenhurst\u2019s Security Guard who is dressed in a black-and-gold skin tight suit. Brock invites Daniel for a drink, which he accepts. Brock tells Daniel, who feigns ignorance about the subject, about two competing companies, Thurston and Baedecker Metals & Mining, who aim to sabotage Viking in order to assume control of Ceres. Despite having been asked by Ravenhurst, who disapproves of Daniel\u2019s methods, not to involve Daniel on the project, Brock asks for Daniel\u2019s help on this matter of corporate espionage. Though he refuses being employed by Brock, citing conflicts of interest, he agrees to enter into a cooperative relationship and to help out. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Daniel Oak, a \"Confidential Expediter\" and agent of the Political Survey Division, is called into the office of Shalimar Ravenhurst, owner of Viking Spacecraft. Work is being done to create a new version of a complex robot, called McGuire, who has been sabotaged in its past six attempts. Daniel has been hired to get down to the issue and prevent further sabotage to the seventh model. Upon entering Ravenhurst's office, Daniel is reprimanded as he is told he caused the sabotage of McGuire. McGuire operates to avoid issues by only following the orders of one individual, that person being the first to speak to him; this person ended up being Daniel. Because of this, Ravenhurst tells Daniel that he must go to Ceres, where McGuire is being built, and aid Viking in building a new model. Daniel heads to Ceres in his flitterboat, where he meets Colonel Brock. Brock tells Daniel that a competing business, Baedecker Metals & Mining Corporation, is trying to drive Viking out of business and overtake Ceres and its resources by causing issues and potential sabotages. However, Brock and Daniel are both aware that it was Ravenhurst's daughter, Jack, that has been causing sabotage, which is kept under wraps. Brock then attempts to hire Daniel to help him with the situation, to which Daniel denies, saying that he cannot conflict with Ravenhurst's contract. Daniel then proposes that they instead work alongside each other, and help each other through services and tasks rather than money, and Brock agrees.",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts with Daniel Oak, a double agent, in Shalimar Raverhurst\u2019s office, and it was the third time that he is on this mountain-sized planetoid. Raverhurst first poured Oak a glass of Madeira. Then he told Oak that he has caused quite a lot of trouble for him. We learn that there is a robot, called McGuire, that has been sabotaged by Oak while he is hired to prevent those kind of things. Because it is kind of difficult to define human being for the robots, thus McGuire is implemented to follow the order of the first person that it speaks to after activation; and apparently, that person is Oak. Then we learn that Oak is a double agent, and he pretends to not know much about this issue at all. So Raverhurst goes on telling Oak why they cannot undo this sabotage: it\u2019s costly thus not worthwhile, and McGuire does not allow others to change his processes. \n\nThen Raverhurst tells Oak that he will be going to Ceres to help build MGYR-8. So then Oak goes into his flitterboat and is going to Ceres. Then we learn from Oak that McGuire is different from other robots such as a traffic robot. Firstly McGuire is mobile in the sense that he is the spacecraft. His spaceship travels very quickly and there is no set paths for the robot to choose from, there is the whole universe. Moreover, he has to deal with unforeseen emergencies as well as with humans. Thus McGuire needs to be able to understand English and can communicate with humans. The most difficult part is defining \u201chuman being,\u201d thus McGuire is set to takes order from one individual. \n\nAfter Oak arrives in Ceres, Colonel Harrington Brock, who is the security guard of Ravenhurst, was waiting for him. Instead of going back for a bath and sleep, Brock asks him to have a drink together. At O\u2019Banion\u2019s Bar Brock asks for Oak\u2019s help, while Oak refuses to help, he suggests that they work together in co-operation."

        "Query": "What is the job of Daniel Oak, the Confidential Expediter who works for the Political Survey Division branch of the System Census Bureau for the UN government, in the story \"His Master's Voice\" and what does he reveal about the use of flitterboats for transportation between Belts?",
        "Article": " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Ten minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\n  \n \n  For obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\n  \n \n  They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\n   \n   average\n   \n  velocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\n  \n \n  I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\n  \n \n  Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\n   \n   DANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n   \n  ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n  \n \n  Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\n  \n \n  And every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\n  \n \n  The Political Survey Division\n   \n   does\n   \n  evaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\n  \n \n  The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\n  \n \n  McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\n   \n   was\n   \n  the spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\n  \n \n  Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\n  \n \n  But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\n   \n   fast\n   \n  ! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\n  \n \n  That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\n  \n \n  And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n   MASTER\n    \n   of Life and Death\n   \n \n \n  by\n   \n  ROBERT SILVERBERG\n  \n \n  ACE BOOKS\n   \n  A Division of A.

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Daniel Oak states that he has an office in New York and describes himself as a Confidential Expediter.

Unbeknownst to most of the System\u2019s citizens, the Political Survey Division is the Secret Service arm of the UN government. \n\nA flitterboat is a more economical option than a full spaceship. It is described as having a single gravitoinertial engine. It is meant to have the most basic necessities that are needed for a person to survive their journey, which includes oxygen, water, and the requirement of food necessary. The flitterboat is not necessarily more affordable, but it does provide the purpose of transporting from one Belt to another Belt.

He was working for Ravenhurst where he had to prevent sabotage. However, during that job, he was not successful since he did sabotage their robot, McGuire. Because he is the first one that the robot spoke to after it is activated, thus McGuire only listens to the order given by him. Moreover, since costly thus not worthwhile , and McGuire\u2019s build in program does not allow tampering. \n\nCurrently, Ravenhurst is telling Oak to go to Ceres to help with the roboticists build MGYR-8. Because Raverhurst wants it to be not only fast and safe, but also wants it to become something that can be used commercially. And later, when he arrives in Ceres, Brock asks him for help. While he didn\u2019t agree to do so, he did suggest they work together, since they are all working for Ravenhurst, there should not be a conflict of interest. "

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n  \n",

        "Summary_4": "Ravenhurst hired Daniel Oak to make sure that the robots will not be sabotaged. However, we learn in the beginning of the story that he accidentally sabotaged the robot, McGuire. Ravenhurst tells Oak that because of what he did, now Ravenhurst\u2019s own position is threatened. Oak was hired because Ravenhurst has spent too much money on the McGuire project where things became shaky at Viking, their company. Oak was supposed to fix it, but instead his chance of losing his position as a manger seems to have increased. Then Ravenhurst tells Oak that the MGYR-7 was built with a different meaning on the term \u201chuman being\u201d than before. Whoever what the first person that speaks to the robot after activation, that person becomes the only individual that the robot takes order from. And apparently McGuire\u2019s first order came from Oak. So now he is the only individual that can order McGuire. Ravenhurst also tells Oak that they simply cannot change McGuire\u2019s memory. So later, Ravenhurst asks Oak to go to Ceres to help them with building MGYR-8. And after arriving, the readers see that Brock and Oak decide to work with each other. "

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  INNOCENT AT LARGE\n  \n \n  By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WOOD\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course\n    \n   he would get into trouble.

        "Summary_1": "A flitterboat is a more economical option than a full spaceship. It is described as having a single gravitoinertial engine. It is meant to have the most basic necessities that are needed for a person to survive their journey, which includes oxygen, water, and the requirement of food necessary. The flitterboat is not necessarily more affordable, but it does provide the purpose of transporting from one Belt to another Belt. Daniel Oak details how a vacuum suit is needed to be worn in a flitterboat. Daniel describes the flitterboat as a tool that does its job, but is not comfortable. ",
        "Summary_2": "A flitterboat is a small, single-person space vehicle capable of navigating from beacon to beacon in the Belt, an area of space in which it is impractical to use full-sized spaceships. It is propelled by a single engine, and contains only a few things necessary for life - water, air, and small amounts of food. \n\tIn order to ride in a flitterboat, the passenger must wear an uncomfortable vac suit and sit straddling a drive tube. The main body of the vessel is composed of a material called transite, which is nearly transparent. The gravitational force inside a flitterboat is one gee. \n",
        "Summary_3": "A flitterboat is a smaller spaceship used for individual transportation on the Belt; to use a full sized spaceship would be inconvenient and impractical, so the flitterboat is used for local travel for one. It has a singular engine and can carry air, and a bit of food and water. It contains an anchor that holds the boat to the ground. Because it is only meant for short travels, one can only last a short amount of time in one, so flitterboats are used to get to and from different beacon points in the neighborhood.",
        "Summary_4": "The flitterboat has a single gravitoinertial engine and it contains a few necessities of life, air, water and little food. But this flitterboat still costs quite a lot. The flitterboat is used for short distance travelling since it is very hard to stay in a vacuum suit for too long. Thus it is common to hop from beacon to beacon, and this decreases the average speed since most of the time one would spend accelerating and decelerating. The flitterboat has a bucket seat for the driver and it produces a one-gee pull. It sits on the drive tube in a way similar to a witch on a broomstick. Importantly, a flitterboat cannot be stopped whenever it wants to, instead it has to get to a beacon station. Oak uses it when he was told by Raverhurst to travel to Ceres, he wears a vacuum suit when he was going to ride it. First he allowed the boat to get to the top of the planetoid by releasing the magnetic anchor and once the station is reached, the flitterboat has to be parked at the specific space assigned by the Landing Control."

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>For more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\n  \n \n \n   First Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\n   \n \n \n \n   Second Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  [15]\n  \n \n \n   Third Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\n   \n \n \n  Nobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\n  \n \n  A traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\n  \n \n  And, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\n  \n \n  With the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\n  \n \n  If one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\n  \n \n  So the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\n  \n \n  If it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\n   \n   responsible\n   \n  human being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\n  \n \n  The robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\n  \n \n  As it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

        "Summary_1": "The most recent McGuire is the seventh edition. It is described as being more mobile as it is a spacecraft. It is potentially dangerous because it can move at thousands of miles per second. The most recent version is different from the previous six because it follows Asimov\u2019s famous Three Laws of Robotics more closely than the other versions. The laws emphasize that a robot should define a human being and making sure the robot does not hurt a human. That has previously proven difficult. McGuire version 7 circumnavigated the issue by defining whatever first awoken the robot as a human and its controller.",
        "Summary_2": "The present iteration of the McGuire, the MGYR-7, is different in its interpretation of Asimov\u2019s three laws of robotics. These three laws, as they are told to the reader by Daniel, are the following: firstly, a robot cannot harm a human being; secondly, a robot must obey orders from human, expect when in conflict with the first law, and thirdly, a robot shall be self-preserving, except when in conflict with the first and third laws. In the first six models of the McGuire, the engineers encoded Asimov\u2019s laws into the machine\u2019s directives. However, this led to erratic and insane-like behaviour from the robot when conflicting commands were issued. \n\tThe seventh iteration, however, resolves this issue by instead restricting the individuals from whom the McGuire takes orders to only that person who issues the first order. The roboticists responsible for designing the McGuire, however, have noticed issues in the MGYR-7, which they aim to resolve in the eighth iteration, the construction of which Daniel has been hired to expedite. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The previous models of McGuire struggled because of the difficulty to define what a \"human being\" is to robots. The Three Laws for robot construction state that robots must not allow harm to a human being, as well as obey orders from a human being. However, when receiving contradicting yet equally qualifying orders from two different human beings, the previous McGuire models would malfunction out of confusion. The seventh model, the current McGuire, narrowed down the definition of what a \"human being\" is, down to an individual. McGuire was constructed so that the individual he would obey would be the first individual that spoke to him when he was built. This is important because Daniel Oak, being the first human to interact with McGuire, is at the center of the robot's objectives.",
        "Summary_4": "Firstly,  McGuire is different because he is mobile, in a way, he is the spaceship. Different from the traffic robot, he is in charge of one single object. But since the object is moving very fast through space where no specified pathway is determined, McGuire has to be able to react fast. Moreover, McGuire needs to understand English in order to communicate with human beings. \n\nMost importantly, the current version of the robot, McGuire, has alteration in the definition of \u201chuman being,\u201d instead of trying to define what human being is as the previous versions did, there will be one person who McGuire takes orders from, since defining individuals are way easier. Previously, they tried to allow robots listen to any one identified as human being. However, this easily made the robots go insane. Once two people \u2013 human beings \u2013 give an opposing order, the robot does not know what to do. The robot does not know who has a higher authority, thus not knowing which order to follow. Taking order from an individual will completely avoid such problems. "

        "Article": "\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  In a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\n  \n \n  She said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\n   \n   knew\n   \n  what that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\n   \n   heard\n   \n  him say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month!

What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\n  \n \n  Anne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\n  \n \n  Star whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\n  \n \n  It must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\n  \n \n  Between the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\n  \n \n  His eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\n  \n \n  And those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story starts with Starrett (Star) Blade\u2019s ship falling into one of the lakes on Alpha Centauri III. We then learns that Currently Star is trying to hunt Devil Garrett down, but his ship was hit by an energy-beam shot by Garrett, who is the top space pirate for years. After he fell, he hopes that Garrett himself will come here to look for him, but only one of Garrett\u2019s men appears and he is killed by Star. He also notices a person with another gun right after he murders that man. He almost kills this person as well, but is able to stop in time due to his strong reflex skills. The reason that he stopped is because she is a girl. She has beautiful dark colored hair and eyes. But she does not stop trying to capture him. Before he can explain himself, he is knocked out. \n\nWhen Star has finally waken up, he is already in a lab chair with Garrett is right in front of him. To his surprise, Garrett calls him Garrett, instead of Star. The girl clearly believes Garrett that Star is actually Garrett. However, again, before he can explain his situation to the girl, he is knocked out. Right after he wakes up, he learns that he will be executed. Then, he starts thinking of the girl again, but he does not really understand why he is thinking of her. Before he can do anything, he is taken from his cell. Standing 5 yards away from the gun that Garrett is holding, he tries to find a way that he could escape. He is glad to see that it is a two way transmitter, but loses his hope again when he realizes that it is an old-style transmitter. Then as the visual image started to form, Garrett is ready to perform the execution. Star cunningly kicks the metal fork onto the vision transmitter, which diverts Garrett\u2019s attention, and causes him to miss the shot. But because he is outnumbered by Garrett\u2019s men, he is caught and knocked out again. After he wake up, the girl finds him and tells him that she is capable of reading lips. Even though the visual images has no sound, she knows what the Section Void Headquarters said, and that he is the actual Star. \n\nGarrett enters the cell after he finds out that the girl knows the real identity of him and Star. So he brings them to a room filled with machines. He imagines to have hundreds of those on Alpha III and he will be able to rule an entire world. Then suddenly the girl takes Garrett\u2019s weapon and Star is able to kill him very quickly.

Star Blade, ejected to safety and now hiding by the lake, waits for Garrett to come for him. Meanwhile, he wonders about the source of the energy for the Barden Beam, as Garrett doesn\u2019t have power plants on the planet, nor is there running water to generate hydroelectric power. Suddenly, Star notices one of Garrett\u2019s soldiers and ambushes him. \nStar Blade, who has earned the nickname Death Star for his fighting prowess, dispatches his fist adversary, and soon after notices another: a beautiful, dark-haired woman.

        "Summary_3": "Starrett Blade, a fighter nicknamed \"Death Star\", has been on the hunt for Devil Garrett, the most dangerous and well-known space pirate. While flying over Alpha Centauri III, a barren and lifeless planet, Star's ship is shot down by a Barden beam, causing him to crash into a lake. Confused as to how such a powerful beam could have been shot on this planet, Star is met with one of Garrett's armed men. Star attacks the man and sees a girl, who he is perplexed by. The girl threatens him, and Star replies by explaining that he's not a pirate, but Death Star. The girl immediately attacks him, knocking him out. Star awakes in a room with the girl, some more men, and face to face with Devil Garrett. To his surprise, Garrett addresses him as the deadly pirate, and calls himself Starrett Blade. Star realizes that Garrett has attempted to swap identities with him, convincing the girl that Garrett was actually the one being captured. Garrett tells Star that he is to be executed, broadcasted to the authorities. Star is knocked out again, this time waking up in a cell and rid of all weapons except for his ace card. Two of Garrett's men enter the cell, and Star attempts to fight them both, which is successful, but his plan is cut short when Garrett steps into the room. Star is led to the execution site, where he stands by a transmitter with Garrett in front of him bearing a gun, the girl next to him. Star inspects the transmitter and realizes that there is a chance the authorities will be able to identify him as the true Star, hopeful that the girl will realize her mistake; however, he concludes that the transmitter's sound wave speed would not be fast enough for the message to come through. As Star faces execution, he flings a fork at the transmitter, damaging a unit of the machine and burning it out. This causes a distraction, and Star is attacked by Garrett's men and falls unconscious again, yet this time accompanied by the girl, who knows now of his true identity due to her ability to read lips on the transmitter. The girl reveals she is Anne Hinton, daughter of John Hinton, who manufactures space equipment. Garrett contacted John, disguising himself as Star to gain his support in crafting hundreds of power plants with Barden beams in order to gain control of the entire planet of Alpha III. Once Garrett reveals his plan, Star uses his ace card, which is a jet weapon, to kill him. Together, Anne and Star fight off Garrett's men, and Star reveals that when he flung the fork at the transmitter, it set off a signal attracting the authorities to their location. With that, Commander Weddel arrives and Garrett's men are turned over to him. Garrett's power plants are then used not for the objective to gain dangerous power, but to supply energy and life to the planet.",

After he kills the man, he sees a girl that distracts him. While he is distracted, he is struck and beaten. When he wakes up after being beaten, he is standing in front of Garrett. Garrett pretends that he is actually Star, for the benefit of the girl, and pretends that Star is actually Garrett. Garret tells Star that he is going to be executed and puts Star into a prison cell.\n\nStar wakes up in his prison cell and is still concerned about what the girl thinks of him. Star fights against the two guards that come to get him from his cell. He stops fighting them when Garrett appears holding an electron knife, as Star sees that as a dangerous weapon. Star is guided towards the transmitter for his planned executive. However, Star thwarts the execution plans by throwing a metal fork at the transmitter which damages it. Again, he gets distracted because of the girl and is beaten. \n\nLater, the girl appears in his cell trying to help him. She tells him that she is Anne Hinton, the daughter of Old John Hinton. Start mentions that he is familiar with her father. Garrett finds the two trying to escape. He leads them down a long corridor and into an incredibly expansive room.  Garrett tells them his plan to control the world. Star remembers that he has another weapon at his disposal and uses it to kill Garrett. Anne and Star then go on to kill some of the guards.

        "Query": "What is the role of Garrett in the DEATH STAR story and what happens to him?",
        "Article": "When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>Star Blade whistled softly through his teeth. A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Garrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n  \n \n  \"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n  \n \n  \"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n  \n \n  \"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\n  \n \n  Star twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\n  \n \n  It was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\n  \n \n  He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\n  \n \n \n \n  And Devil Garrett died.\n  \n \n  There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\n  \n \n  And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\n  \n \n  Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\n  \n \n  Two of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\n  \n \n  The other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\n  \n \n  There was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n  \n \n",

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",

        "Query": "How did Garrett deceive the girl into believing that he is Star and Star is Garrett in DEATH STAR?",
        "Article": "When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\n  \n \n  He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\n  \n \n  Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\n  \n \n  The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\n  \n \n  A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\n  \n \n  Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\n  \n \n  The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\n  \n \n  The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\n  \n \n  The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\n  \n \n  Which was right, in a way.\n  \n \n  Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\n  \n \n  Not at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\n  \n \n  Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\n  \n \n  It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\n  \n \n  Somehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\n  \n \n  Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\n  \n \n  But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\n  \n \n  It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Firstly, a month ago, Garrett pretends to be Star and successfully deceived the girl\u2019s father and was communicating with him about his development on some power processes. And according to the girl, she was captured by Garrett and brought to the craft around a month ago. Note that no one knows what he is really hoping to accomplish by pretending to be Star. Secondly, for the past month, he has been using 3-dimensional images and detailed description of Star as Garrett to make the girl believe his made-up identity. This also finishes successfully and the girl was sure that Star was Garrett, Garret as Star. Thirdly, during the execution, Garrett uses the delay in voice from the visual images to make sure that the girl will not be able to hear anything that the Section Void Headquarters would say when they see Garrett murdering Star. But he lets her see the images so that when their faces are filled with surprises to see Star being captured, the visual images will lead the girl to believe that they are shocked because they see Garret. However, this part of the plan failed. The girl is able to read lips, thus from the visuals, she knows exactly what the headquarters are saying. Hence she learns the truth of Garrett and Star\u2019s identity. She also learns that he has been lying to him and her father. ",
        "Summary_2": "Prior to meeting the girl, Anne Hinton, Devil Garrett, the top space pirate, had contacted Anne\u2019s father Old John Hinton while posing as Starrett Blade. Garrett\u2019s deception of Anne is furthered by his forgery of certain documents, including papers describing Garrett as having Star\u2019s description, and a three-dimensional picture. \nHis deception, however, is foiled during a transmission between the pirate and Police Commander Weddel which was meant to broadcast Star\u2019s execution. During the silent broadcast, Weddel\u2019s mouth moves and Anne is able to read his lips, coming to believe that Star is who he claims to be. \n",
        "Summary_3": "To make Anne believe that Garrett is Star and Star is Garrett, Garrett communicated with her father, posing as Star and claiming that he was interested in working with him to develop power plants. John Hinton, who supplies Star with much of his equipment, agreed to work with Garrett. Anne has been staying with Garrett for a month, during which he showed her fake papers and photos that supported his lie. Once Anne met Star for the first time, she was under the belief that Garrett was actually Star. Because of this, she immediately thought that Star was lying when he shared his name, and was able to help bring him to Garrett. ",
        "Summary_4": "Garrett made the girl believe that he was Star and that Star was Garrett because he provided her with papers that he claimed showed a picture of Garrett with a description. The picture was in fact one of Star Blade. In addition, he had his guards pretend that he was Star Blade too. However, unlike the girl, the guards knew that he was actually Garrett. He made the girl fear Star Blade (pretending Star was actually Garrett) by telling the girl that Star was a horrible pirate that killed many people and had to be executed. In addition, the girl\u2019s father communicated with Garrett while he was pretending to be Star. This is another reason she thought she could trust him. "

        "Article": "He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n  \n \n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n   \n   pirate\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n  \n \n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n  \n \n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n  \n \n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n  \n \n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n  \n \n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n  \n \n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\n  \n \n  The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\n  \n \n  He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\n  \n \n  Star's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\n  \n \n  Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\n  \n \n  Star said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n  \n \n  \"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\n  \n \n  Fire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward.

You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Star\u2019s ship is hit by the electric beam, he has an electron knife with him. And when he heard footsteps coming his way, he holds onto it firmly. When the man gets near the water and sees the ship sink, Star quickly kills him with the electron knife by stabbing right to his heart. He takes the man\u2019s jet-gun with him as well. He is also going to use the jet-gun on the girl, but his great reflexes are able to stop him from doing so, however, she paralyzes him first. After he is knocked out and brought to the cell, he looks for his weapons, but they are all taken by Garrett\u2019s men except one. At the place that execution is supposed to take place, Star kicks the metal fork towards the visual transmitter, which will send signals for help. When Garrett takes them to the machinery room, the girl takes the jet weapon from Garrett, Star uses a tiny jet to shoot Garret right before Garret shot him. While Star\u2019s scalp gets injured, he is able to shoot right at Garret\u2019s vitals with his quickness and alertness, thus making him die almost immediately.",
        "Summary_2": "Star possesses a jet-gun and an electron blade which he stores on his belt. Additionally, he maintains an additional jet weapon discreetly stored on his person. His primary weapon, the jet-gun, is a deadly weapon, but one which must be reloaded by pressing a loading stuff to slide ammunition into place. His electron blade, stored in a water-proof sheath, is a blade whose full potential is realizable when it is activated. Upon the pressing of its electron stud, the electron blade produces blue fire. The jet weapon, which Star uses to kill Devil Garrett, is slightly smaller than a fountain pen and has thick sides. Star refers to this weapon as his \u201cace\u201d. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Some of the equipment that Star uses in the story is supplied by John Hinton, including the ship he flies at the beginning of the story, which is shot down. Aside from the ship, Star possesses several weapons throughout the story, including an electron knife and a gun. Once Star is captured by Garrett, he is stripped of most of his weapons, except for his hidden \"ace card\", which is revealed to be a jet gun concealed in a smaller form. Star also possesses knowledge of transmitters and their functions; because of this, he is able to use Garrett's transmitter to alert the authorities of his location by breaking a unit of the machine that sends a distress signal. ",
        "Summary_4": "In the beginning, Star uses an electron knife that he keeps in a water-proof covering. The knife produces a blue fire when it is used to stab someone. When Star Blade is about to be executed by the transmitter, he pulls out a metal fork. The metal fork damages the transmitter by striking a small area where there are wires and braces. The metal fork prevents Star from being executed by the transmitter. The last weapon that Star has on him after he has used the previous two is a jet weapon the size of a fountain pen. He uses the jet weapon to kill Garrett. "

        "Article": " \n  The Snare\n  \n \n  By RICHARD R. SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEISS\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n   \n  on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   It's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\n   \n \n \n \n  I glanced at the path we had made across the\n   \n   Mare Serenitatis\n   \n  . The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\ncomes down the passage?\"\n  \n \n  Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain\nlooked up from his desk, then jumped up.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're doing, busting in here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you're planning a course change, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've got damn big ears.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think we'd better call in at Jorgensen's.\"\n  \n \n  \"You do, huh?\" the captain sat down. \"I'm in command of this vessel,\"\nhe said. \"I'm changing course for Alabaster.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't find it convenient to go to Alabaster,\" Retief said. \"So\njust hold your course for Jorgensen's.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not bloody likely.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your use of the word 'bloody' is interesting, Captain. Don't try to\nchange course.\"\n  \n \n  The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\n  \n \n  \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\nthe desk, gripped the captain's wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he\neased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\ndrawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\n  \n \n  \"You busted it, you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\nhoods.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't put it over, hick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\nhe said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\nthe mike and looked up at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\nto sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\n  \n \n  Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door.\n  \n \n  \"Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's\ngoing on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with\na sick friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\n  \n \n  Retief settled himself in a chair.\n  \n \n  \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I'm going to\nstay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.\"\n  \n \n  The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel\nlike dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don't mind me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.\n  \n \n  \"If anything happens that I don't like,\" he said, \"I'll wake you up.\nWith this.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Ed, along with his wife Verana, and their friends Kane, Miller and Marie are out for a walk on the surface of the Moon. They live there, working in the lunar city. They come across a spherical object, about 2 miles in diameter. Miller, a mineralogist, declares that the metal must be at least a few thousand years old. A circular door opens, revealing a small room inside. Kane enters the room. The rest of the group decide to join Kane, but as Miller tries to cross the threshold, he is thrown back. The door shuts behind the group and they are trapped inside. The group try to intercom back to Miller, and then radio back to Lunar City, but all they get is static. The group realise that they are flying through outer space. An inner door opens to reveal a passageway. They arrive at a dead end at the end of the passageway. Just then, a door opens to the right of Kane, an invisible force pushing him into a separate room, and locking the entrance behind him. Marie, his wife is lifted up and placed into a separate chamber. Ed and Verana search the corridor, the remaining doors opening for them. The couple wander around the rooms for eating, sleeping, recreation, bathing and an observatory. A few minutes later, they are joined by Marie and Kane. The two relay how they were told that this ship belongs to an Alien race which arrived on Earth thousands of years ago, and wanted to study humans once they gained the ability of space flight. They mean no harm and want to take them to their planet to study them. They are met by the voice of a faceless artificial intelligence controlling the ship. It informs them there is no way to turn it's course around. The group search the rooms for tools for escape, but soon realise that there is nothing. Kane tries to think of a solution to their problem. Kane starts to drink a liquid like whiskey, which makes him intoxicated. Kane begins to beat himself up. The machine tells him to stop, and that if it arrives with a damaged crew, it's masters will be disappointed. The machine informs the crew that it has no way to physically interact with or restrain them. *blank* brings Kane to his bunker and goes back to his wife to go to sleep. They wake up later, all tied to chairs in the \"kitchen\". Kane has knocked them out in their sleep and restrained them. Kane starts to choke Ed, asking the machine what will happen if the ship arrives to the alien world, and all the crew are dead. The machine would have failed its assignment. Kane proposes that if the machine takes them back to the Moon, then the computer will not have failed, and it might have the chance again to pick up a crew. The machine agrees and takes them on a course for the Moon. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mankind has moved from Earth and lived on the Moon for over a year. One evening, Ed and his wife Verana, along with Miller, Harry Kane and his wife Marie, decide to take a leisurely stroll on the Moon's surface. As they walk along the path, they stumble upon a strange large object, a spherical figure of metal that, according to Kane, an experienced mineralogist, was several thousand years old. As the group examines the object, they notice an opening forming on its surface. Kane climbs through the opening and convinces the rest of the group to follow him. As Miller climbs through the opening, he is suddenly pushed back onto the ground as the opening shuts, locking the four inside the object. They soon lose connection in their intercoms and realize that the static they hear is due to the fact that the object is beginning to move through outer space. Another door opens, revealing a long corridor, and Ed and the group take off their spacesuits, taking in the oxygen. As they reach the end of the corridor, two doors open as Marie and Kane are shoved into separate rooms. Ed and Verana, now alone, walk back down the corridor where six rooms are open, finding strange food, games, and an observatory. Marie returns in a trance, saying that a telepathic voice had reached out to her in the room and searched her memories. Kane walks in shortly after, enraged, explaining that aliens had taken the group captive after planting the object on the Moon as a booby trap; they are to be on the ship for six months and be experimented on as members of the human race. Kane suggests that the group find a way to take control of the ship, when a mysterious voice fills the room, discouraging him. The voice explains that it is a machine located in the ship, and that its masters want to study the group to fulfill their curiosity about humans. After searching the entirety of the rooms open to them, the group gives up, and Ed and Kane meet in the kitchen while their wives are asleep. Kane comes across a bottle of alcohol, and becomes intoxicated, growing increasingly violent. When he punches the wall, the machine asks him not to hurt himself, as its masters do not want the humans to arrive damaged. The next morning, Ed, Verana, and Marie awake tied to chairs in the kitchen, as Kane walks in, still drunk. Kane has a plan to make the machine let the group go; he strangles Ed, causing the machine to plead, and Kane gives the machine an ultimatum: return the group back to the Moon or bring the group to its masters, dead. The machine agrees to return the group to the Moon just before Ed loses consciousness.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Ed and his crew are traveling across the Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity) on the Moon. They see a smooth metal object protruding from the surface and go closer to investigate. The object looks foreign, and Ed wants to call the Lunar City authorities. However, Kane stops him and says this could be an opportunity to become famous. Ed agrees with Kane\u2019s idea, and Miller explains that the strange object was made thousands of years ago from an even stronger alloy than steel. The crew goes into the steel object through an opening, where Kane tells his wife, Marie, he sees gadgets for controls and weird drawings. Marie climbs through the passage, and Ed helps his wife Verana too. He tries to help Miller through the opening, but an invisible force suddenly pushes Miller out of view. Ed strikes an invisible wall and realizes that the door has closed on them. Suddenly, the lights turn on, and Kane tasks Miller with opening the door from the outside. Miller\u2019s breath disappears soon after, and Ed tries to dial Lunar City but only hears static. They decide to explore the area, and a force suddenly shoves Kane through a door that closes behind him. Only Verana and Ed are left behind. Both of them are scared, and they go through the corridor again to see six open doors. They go into the nearest door and find containers alongside some drawings. Verana recognizes the strange containers as food, and they taste some of it. After exploring, they enter an observatory, where Marie joins them shortly after. She says that something spoke to her telepathically. Kane comes in angrily, and he exclaims that this ship is the booby-trap of a race from another galaxy. The trip is six months long, and a voice suddenly tells them that there is no chance they can bring the ship back to the Moon. The voice is a machine that is part of the ship, and it says that its masters are only curious about humans. The crew does not believe the voice, but they give up after five hours of fruitless searching. Kane gets drunk and has a violent outburst, which causes the machine to plead with him to stop because it will displease its alien masters. The next morning, Ed awakens to him, Marie, and Verana being tied in chairs by Kane. Kane then chokes Ed to show the machine that he is willing to kill everybody on this ship if it does not go back. He bargains with the machine and says that the alien masters will not learn about its failure to deliver live human cargo. The machine agrees to bring them back to the Moon. Kane lets go of Ed\u2019s throat to triumphantly tell him that there is always a solution, while Ed is just happy to breathe again. ",
        "Summary_4": "A group of people are walking through a desert on the Moon when they discover a strange object which reminds a part of a sphere. The group decides to explore the object themselves to become wealthy and famous in case it's something important. The party finds a hole and gets inside the sphere. Suddenly, the door closes and leaves Miller, a feeble mineralogist outside. The group tries calling Lunar City but the radio is static as if they were in outer space.Then another door opens revealing a corridor and the party goes there, removing the helmets and breathing normally. Then another door opens and closes after Kane. Marie disappears behind another door in the same way. Ed and Verana are left alone, they are scared, so, when other doors open, Ed walks them both into the nearest one. One room follows another and in the end the couple sits down in an observatory and is soon joined by Marie. The least tells about a telepathic voice searching through her memories and calming her down. When Kane joins, he is angry about being guinea pigs. He explains that they are an experiment for aliens watching Earth develop for thousands of years already. Now the party is trapped and taken to an alien planet for study. While they are discussing the possibility of escape, the ship talks to them and says they can't escape but won't be harmed. It says the aliens are simply curious in examining people. After a full search the group gives up the idea to harm the ship or escape. The women go to sleep and the men are drinking in the kitchen. Ed is calm and curious, while Kane gets even more mad and aggressive than before. Ed drags Kane to the sleeping compartment and leaves with Marie. Ed goes to sleep with his wife. In the night Kane drags all three to the kitchen and ties them to chairs where they wake up. Kane plans to return home by any means and starts tightening his fingers around Ed's throat to make the machine act. After some thinking, the machine decides to return and Kane is proud of his success. "

        "Article": " \n  The Snare\n  \n \n  By RICHARD R. SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEISS\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n   \n  on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   It's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\n   \n \n \n \n  I glanced at the path we had made across the\n   \n   Mare Serenitatis\n   \n  . The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've\ndone everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a\nthorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally,\nis in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions\nare being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the\nevening\u2014which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\"\n  \n \n  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table.\nCeleste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that\nhad engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.\n  \n \n  \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly\nabout the Deep Shaft.\"\n  \n \n  \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five\nmiles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\"\n  \n \n  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes\nwent toward Ivan's briefcase.\n  \n<doc-sep>The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins on the surface of the Moon. The group revels in its beauty and the clear, star filled sky. They soon enter into the alien spaceship. The opening chamber's walls are filled with drawings and instruments. There are \"Kaleidoscopic\" lights that flash on and off. A small door opens to reveal a narrow passageway. The passageway is lined with eight doors, with no way to open them. Kane and Marie are pulled by some invisible forces into the first two rooms. Ed and Verana first enter into the \"kitchen\". It's a large room with shelves running along its walls, full of multicoloured containers and bottles. There is a table and four backless chairs in the centre, and the floor is a shiny green. There are drawings of a naked man and woman eating from the contents of the boxes. The second room is dedicated to recreation. There are numerous containers filled with alien games and books. There are more simple drawings to use as instructions to go along with them. They enter the sleeping quarters next, where the floors are squishy and the lights are ambient and relaxing. They go into a bathroom, with a large bath, alien toilets and soap. They finally enter an observatory. On one side is floor to ceiling see through, and the room is furnished with comfortable chairs. ",
        "Summary_2": "The beginning of the story takes place on the Moon's surface, described as a sea of dust and a calm, vast plain. The characters then find a strange object on the Moon, a tall, curved piece of metal. The rest of the story takes place inside this object; first, they find themselves in a strange, small room with walls covered in foreign drawings and lights. Then, they are in a long corridor, where the doors are within the walls without handles. The doors in the corridor open on their own, revealing several different rooms, including a room with colorful boxes of food, a recreational room with games and books, a room with a bathing pool, sleeping quarters, and an observatory with transparent ceilings and walls. The rooms are somewhat recognizable, yet unfamiliar and foreign to the humans.",
        "Summary_3": "The story is initially set on the Moon. The area where Ed and his crew explore consists of a smooth layer of pumice that stretches extremely far. There are also occasional rock islands that go off into the stars above. The Mare Serenitatis also covers three hundred and forty thousand square miles. Lunar City is also on the Moon, and humans have been living there for over a year already. \n\nThe spaceship they board later has a long corridor with multiple rooms. There is a kitchen for food. It is lined with shelves that contain thousands of colored boxes and bottles. The green floor is plastic-like, and at the center, there is a table with four chairs. The chairs have no back and are supported by a single column. As a tutorial, there are drawings on the wall of a man and woman going through the steps of eating. Apart from the food room, there is also a recreation room that has games. All of the instructions are in drawings. The ship also has two sleeping quarters with floors that have a spongy substance and dimly-lit lights. One of the other rooms is similar to a bathroom, with a small bathing pool and running water. Other amenities include yellow soap and a waste-disposal unit. The last room they go to is an observatory. It features transparent walls, a transparent ceiling, and stars that shine outside. There are also comfortable chairs to sit in and observe the stars. \n\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins on the surface of the Moon, in a smooth desert made of pumice, under cold and faint stars. In the middle of the desert there is a huge alien sphere. Then the setting moves into the room inside the sphere with weird drawings and gadgets. A narrow corridor opens from there, even there the walls seem alien. The doors in the corridor keep opening and closing by themselves behind people. Ed and Verana find themselves in a large room with a table with chairs and food on the shelves. There are also simple drawings on the walls looking like instructions. The next room is a recreation room with games and books, then there are sleeping quarters, a small pool and the last one is an observatory with a transparent wall. Then the characters move throughout the ship and the rooms described. Eventually, the women go to sleep and the men are talking in the kitchen. Then they go to the dormitories. In the morning everyone is in the kitchen, the rest three bound to chairs by Kane. Some events take place in the kitchen and the ship heads back. "

        "Query": "How does Kane's violent drinking outburst impact the plot in The Snare?",
        "Article": "The machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n  \n \n  \"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" the machine admitted.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\n   \n   all of us\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  The alien electronic brain was silent.\n  \n \n  By this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n  \n \n  \"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\n  \n \n  My fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n  \n \n  \"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\n  \n \n  A long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n  \n \n  \"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\n  \n \n  Kane released his grip on my throat.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n  \n<doc-sep>For several minutes, we sampled the different foods. Every one had a\ndistinctive flavor, comparable to that of a fruit or vegetable on Earth.\n  \n \n  Kane lifted a brown bottle to his lips, took a huge gulp and almost\nchoked.\n  \n \n  \"Whiskey!\"\n  \n \n  \"My masters realized your race would develop intoxicants and tried to\ncreate a comparable one,\" the machine explained.\n  \n \n  I selected a brown bottle and sampled the liquid. \"A little stronger\nthan our own,\" I informed the machine.\n  \n \n  We drank until Kane was staggering about the room, shouting insults at\nthe alien race and the mechanical voice that seemed to be everywhere.\nHe beat his fist against a wall until blood trickled from bruised\nknuckles.\n  \n \n  \"Please don't hurt yourself,\" the machine pleaded.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \" Kane screamed at the ceiling. \"Why should you care?\"\n  \n \n  \"My masters will be displeased with me if you arrive in a damaged\ncondition.\"\n  \n \n  Kane banged his head against a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed rapidly.\n\"Shtop me, then!\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't. My masters created no way for me to restrain or contact you\nother than use of your language.\"\n  \n \n  It took fully fifteen minutes to drag Kane to his sleeping compartment.\n  \n \n  After I left Kane in his wife's care, I went to the adjoining room and\nstretched out on the soft floor beside Verana.\n  \n \n  I tried to think of some solution. We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\n  \n \n  Solution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\n  \n \n  I wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\n  \n \n  They had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\n  \n \n  The aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\n   \n   And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Six rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\n  \n \n  The rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\n  \n \n  After intensive searching, we realized there was\n   \n   no way\n   \n  to damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\n  \n \n  We gave up.\n  \n \n  The women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  At random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n  \n \n  \"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n  \n \n  \"You sure?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Does\n   \n  every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\n  \n \n  My resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Ed and Kane go to the kitchen and start to sample random bottles and foods. Kane finds a brown bottle filled with a strong liquid. The artificial intelligence explains that it is a liquor intended to mimic something like what the alien race presumed would be created on Earth. He starts to drink it and soon becomes intoxicated. He starts to punch himself and then beats his head against the wall. His knuckles become bloody and he gets a bruise on his head. The computer asks him not to hurt himself, as its masters will be disappointed if they arrive in the alien world injured. The computer has no way to physically interfere with the crew. This hatches an idea in Kane's mind. If the computer arrives with a damaged or even dead crew, then the machine will have failed its assignment.  He threatens to kill the entire crew, which would mean that the machine would arrive on the planet empty handed. He offers the machine an alternative. If it drops them back on Mars, then it will not have really failed, because the only way to truly fail would be to arrive with a dead crew. Additionally, if the machine stayed on the Moon's surface, it might have an opportunity to pick up another crew in the future. This plan is all due to a whiskey-like substance. ",
        "Summary_2": "Kane's violent drinking outburst initially causes him to punch the wall with his fist, causing him to bleed. This causes the machine to respond by pleading with Kane, revealing that its masters ordered it to bring the humans to them unscathed. This revelation about the machine's conditions inspires Kane further, and the next morning, he constructs a plan to get the group off the ship. Still intoxicated, Kane ties up the group, and uses violence against Ed to get the machine to free them. Thus, Kane's outburst, though chaotic and violent, ultimately led to the group's freedom.",
        "Summary_3": "Kane\u2019s violent drinking outburst helps him think of a solution to force the machine to let them go back to the Moon. He initially does not know what to do, but he notices the machine does not want the human passengers getting injured when it desperately tells him to stop beating against the wall. This reaction helps him formulate a plan, and he decides to tie Ed, Verana, and even his wife Marie up. He tries to explain to Ed that the machine is afraid of displeasing its masters, which is why he has found the solution to their problem. His plan, therefore, is to threaten to kill all of them until the machine turns the ship around. He puts it into motion, and it scares the machine enough that it works to convince it to let them go back. ",
        "Summary_4": "Due to Kane's drinking outburst the machine agrees to return to the Moon. The situation seems to have no solution, but as promised, Kane finds one. If he wasn't drunk, this wouldn't occur him, he wouldn't have enough determination. But Kane's aggressive nature together with alcohol have made him violent enough to make this scene. The machine is confused and doesn't know what to do, Kane's move is clever and he urges the machine to return. This saves the group from being held on an alien planet but it also scares everyone in the group and puts Ed in danger. This action prevents the group from meeting aliens."

When Kane is thrown into a separate room from the rest of the crew, Marie throws herself against the door and tries with all her strength to get it to open, until she herself is put in a separate room. The room is dark, and she is touched by a telepathic voice that tells her not to worry. They won't hurt her, and they only want to learn something about her. The voice seems to search through her memories, looking at her high school days. It also looked at human customs and their lives in general. The room must be filled with some sort of happiness gas, because she comes out of it to join the rest of the crew in an airy, relaxed mood that soon wears off. She then searches the ship for a way to break out with the rest of the group but finds nothing. She goes to sleep with Verana. She wakes up to Kane having tied them all up.

When the two are left alone after Marie and Kane are taken into separate rooms, they work together to investigate the rest of the corridor and try to piece together bits of information cooperatively.

        "Summary_3": "Ed and Verana are married to each other. They get along well, and the two of them often stick together.

On the other hand, Ed also tries to keep calm in most situations but gets nervous if it is potentially dangerous to him or his wife. When Verana is scared after what happens to Marie in the corridor, he puts his arm around her protectively and holds her close. Ed also knows Verana\u2019s interests very well. He is aware that she is part of a group researching extra-sensory perception, and she most likely would have loved the opportunity to experience what Marie had.",

When they are left alone in the corridor, Ed sees her fear and holds her close. Ed is also scared but he takes charge of the situation to lead his wife, and when other doors open the couple enters together. They follow each other through the rooms and each one does the same actions as another. Ed remembers about Verana's interest in extra-sensory perception and even wonders sarcastically if she is disappointed about not being contacted. The two are relatively calm and secure, they understand that nothing can be done and agree to it. Verana thinks logically and with inner serenity, Ed appreciates it and feels calm and resigned. They are similar and therefore make up a stable couple. Verana is scared for her husband when Kane is choking it as a normal wife would be, but overall the couple is as calm as possible. Moreover, both are rather interested in the aliens and support each other all the way, their couple is harmonious, especially on the contrast."

HESSE, CAPT.\n  \n \n  Kaiser pushed the last of his meal\u2014which he had been eating with his\nfingers\u2014into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his\nhands with it and dropped it to the floor.\n  \n \n  He pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding\nthe captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for\nserious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only\nto the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment.\nIt was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from\nthe ship on his trip.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname. Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Rourke is the lieutenant with the nicked jaw who Shano first meets at the air lock. He initially refuses the ticket and reminds Shano that there is a Red signal placed on the Stardust. He tells Shano that the latter is heading towards his funeral but still ends up punching his ticket. Rourke is indirectly mentioned when Shano asks the captain about nicked jaws, a question to which the captain responds that it happens when somebody has cut himself shaving. Rourke is later revealed to be a traitor loyal to the Uranians and attempts to sabotage the ship so that the Uranian fleet can force the Stardust to surrender. He is a manipulative individual, capable of convincing most crew members that he is innocent and means no harm. He also pretends to act surprised that Shano is on board, knowing that he will betray them to the Uranians. Rourke is also a very sneaky person. When the ship turns off all mechanics to avoid detection, he uses the opportunity to sneak into the engine room and mess up the ship\u2019s controls. He can remain mostly undetected, only seen by Shano as he hurries into the room. ",
        "Summary_2": "Rourke is a lieutenant on the ship who has a nick on his jaw. This is believed to be a feature of those who sell out to Uranus. Rourke is a traitor, he planted an electronic signal box to give away the ship's position and provoke the Uranian attack.He didn't want Shano to get on board and warned him. Rourke is a chunky man with a blaster. He is young, strong and angry at Shano for getting involved. Rourke dies as a consequence of a fight with Shano who considers him a traitor. ",
        "Summary_3": "Rourke is the lieutenant of the ship, who is a nick-jawed Earthman. Rourke first refuses the ticket, stating that it is signal red. After having faint memories within his mind, he takes Shano\u2019s ticket mentioning that it is his funeral. He is staring out to the viewport when Shano spots him later, Shano thinks that he is just idling. Later, he is suspiciously using the Engine Room emergency exit when Shano spots him again. He is chunky and holsters a flat blaster. He has weaker hands than Shano. And is killed by Shano. ",
        "Summary_4": "Rourke is the lieutenant of the starship ``Stardust\" who sells out the ship to the Uranians. He is clearly a very crooked character from this one act alone, taking personal gain over the lives of his crew. He is described as \"sullen\" and \"chunky\". His one redeeming quality that could be found would be in when he tried to convince Shano not to board that ship, thus he would have saved his life. He calls Shano an old man, clearly giving off a rude and unpleasant demeanor. He is a shifty, complicated character, because while he sold the ship out to the Uranians, and is not very polite, he did look out for Shano. \n"

        "Article": "The ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Shano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\n  \n \n  Pressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\n  \n \n  The cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\n  \n \n  Shano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\n  \n \n  Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\n  \n \n  He acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\n  \n \n  He was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\n  \n \n  A bell clanged.\n  \n \n  Shano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\n  \n \n  Shano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\n  \n \n  Shano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\n  \n<doc-sep>The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\n  \n \n  The ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\n   \n   Emergency. Battle posts.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\n  \n \n  The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\n  \n \n  This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\n  \n \n  The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n  \n \n  \"Fire number seven.\"\n  \n \n  He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\n  \n \n  This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\n  \n \n  He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\n  \n \n  The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n  \n \n  \"Hold fire.\"\n  \n \n  He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Stand by.\"\n  \n \n  Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\n  \n \n  This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n  \n \n  \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\n  \n \n  Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\n  \n \n  He poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\n  \n \n  He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\n  \n \n  A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n  \n \n  \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\n  \n \n  Shano blinked.\n  \n \n  Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n \n \n   \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\n   \n \n \n \n  He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\n  \n \n  Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\n  \n \n  He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\n  \n<doc-sep>A tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Shano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n  \n \n  \"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\n  \n \n  Giddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n  \n \n  \"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\n  \n \n  Shano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Stardust's\n   \n  mechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\n  \n \n  Shano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\n  \n \n  The engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\n  \n \n  The speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and thought.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Shano\u2019s occupation is being a miner and laborer. His time mining on Pluto leaves his lungs permanently damaged, and he has a constant cough that never seems to go away. However, he has been to many other planets as well, including Mars and Uranus. Although Shano is only a lowly miner, his actions also reveal how courageous and righteous he is as a person. His decision to take the liner, despite the red signal, shows that he is willing to take risks to reach his goal. Later, when he remembers why Rourke cannot be trusted, he does not hesitate to take matters into his own hands to deal with the traitor. Shano\u2019s bravery is also shown when he braves the toxic gas to save the liner. He knows that he can last for up to 12 hours at most and that he will most likely die on the trip home. However, this does not deter him if he can get the ship safely to Venus. While Shano\u2019s occupation in the story is not regarded highly, his actions show that he should not be underestimated. ",
        "Summary_2": "Shano is tired of his life and wants to rest. He goes back home with the thought of dying there. For this reason he puts himself in danger by taking this flight with a red signal - he doesn't have what to live for, only for coming home to die. He is also brave and noble as he saves the whole crew by going to the engine room. He is full of initiative, he can't sit still in the cabin. His mind is not used to thinking, he is a worker but he understands he is the only one who can last in the toxic gas and he understands who the traitor is. His desire to get home alive or dead moves him forward and makes him brave as it is the only sense in his life. He is happy to be of use at least as he feels old and feeble from time to time as he has worked with gas and his lungs are damaged.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Shano is very weak, when he coughs his whole body jerk. He also has arthritic joints pain along his limbs. He was digging, lifting, lugging and pounding around the planet for his whole life. He states that he is a laborer. He has worked in the Plutonian mines, where other men died from the toxia gas, he simply got sick because of the gum-clogged lungs. \n\nHe acts impulsively. He has heard rumors about nicked jaws, which lead him to murder Rourke. He does not really feel happy or sad when thinking of going home, but he is determined to go home to die. However, he changes his mind when he heard about the toxia gas in the engine room. When the red signal appears, he still decides to aboard the ship. He knows that he is not used to thinking, but doing works by his hands. Shano knows that he is helping the ship by entering the Engine Room, thus he feels happy. He calls himself useless, but being able to accomplish something as important as killing a spy and driving the ship, he feels good. This is more important than dying at home. ",
        "Summary_4": "Shano is an ex-labourer, working on different planets as he went. He has spent his life \"digging, lifting, lugging and pounding\". He is tired and hates the idea of spending another minute on Mercury. He is frustrated with his position in life, having a bit of a chip on his shoulder, immediately noticing the change in treatment the captain shows him once he realises his occupation. A lifetime of working on his feet has left his body aching, and all he wants to do is get home to die. It seems he has given up in life. He believes that he hasn't lived a life of any note, and he just wants to end it now. He reveals his insecurity through his thoughts, presuming about how the captain and crew see him based on his status. He is wise and has a great memory, being able to rehash a conversation he had with a coworker about a man with a notched jaw. He is clearly resentful of the way he has been treated in life, calling himself an \"ignorant\" man. He is clearly very curious, going outside his bunk when the ship goes dark. He breaks rules and doesn't take orders. He also clearly has a very strong sense of right and wrong, killing Rourke when he realises who he is. He decides he finally wants to be a hero in life, and goes and mends the ship. He displays not only his sense of duty in this but his longing for recognition. "

        "Summary_1": "One of the main pieces of equipment used on the Stardust liner is a loudspeaker. The primary role of the speaker is to give out instructions to the crew on the ship and makes any important announcements. The men also use phosphorescent bulbs as a light source to navigate their surroundings when the liner goes into total shutdown. Crew members also carry around a blaster for protection, most likely if there is ever a need for self-defense. There is also usage of a ray gun to fight back against the Uranian fleets. To ensure survival, emergency oxygen pipes are used to maintain atmosphere. Shano also carries a pack of cigarettes that do not seem important but later become essential to the story.",
        "Summary_2": "The ship is locked with multiple air locks. There is a panel of studs in the control room. The pilot is in earphones. A loud-speaker gives orders. Machinery is stopped and lights are out when ship is hiding from the enemy. For such cases there are emergency oxygen cylinders. Some men have blasters. There were port guns and ray guns and the battle was almost silent. Pipes are all around. There is a screen and a selector in the engine room which keep the ship going. Toxia gas is needed to make the selector work but people can't handle it. There is massive machinery and a shattered gold-gleaming cylinder in the engine room which make the whole ship move. Heavy rods are there which need to be lifted.",
        "Summary_3": "Firstly, Shano is wearing polarized goggles, but it is unclear what it is used for. Secondly, there is a gray box next to the pipes at the corner of the passageway, which is used to attract the Uranians detection since its dial needle keeps quivering when everything else went silence. It\u2019s assumed by Shano that this device was planted by the spy of the Uranians. When Shano fights with Rourke, he first uses his cigarette to dug into Rourke\u2019s face and uses his hand to grasp Rouke\u2019s neck, which makes his face turn purple and choked to death. When Shano is fixing the rod, he simply uses his bare hand whenever the rods fall. ",
        "Summary_4": "There is various equipment employed throughout the story. Phosphorescent bulbs are used when the ship goes dark to light the passageways. A grey box with two switches and a radium dial is used. It is an electric signal box to give away the ship's position. An intercom is employed so the captain can speak to the crew. There are port guns used in battle. Atom motors are employed to keep the ship running. Shano uses the selector valve rods to keep the ship running. \n"

I glanced ever so casually toward the\nremaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But\nhe was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n  \n \n  I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n  \n \n  He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance\nand put my suitcase on the stone steps there.

The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran\nthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied\nme.\n  \n \n  I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a\nman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing\nsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could\nI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the\nbag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to\nlive with myself.\n  \n \n  No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014until\nwhat?\n  \n \n  A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of\nthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a\npair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could\ntell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the\nwhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own\nbusiness.\n  \n \n  But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started\nacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,\n\"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But\nI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim\ncounter out of the side of my eye.\n  \n \n  The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp\nto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went\ninside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag\non the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The\nclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n  \n \n  I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How\nmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the\ncounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I\nhad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the\nclock again.\n  \n \n  \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n  \n \n  \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n  \n \n  I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the\ncounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the\ndevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel\nescaped my grasp.\n  \n \n  \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n  \n \n  I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood\nthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand\nshe had a green baggage claim check.\n  \n \n  The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight\ncase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,\nglanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n  \n \n  \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying\nafter her.\n  \n",

There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it?

Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth.

The next morning he has a short but difficult talk with his anxious parents. Marsh's dad takes him to the Skyharbor, the young man feels uneasy. Then he goes through a check up at psychiatrist's and space surgeon's, revises the route, and takes a nap. Then his Colonel gives him a brief speech, and his cadet friends wish him luck. Thousands of spectators and reporters try to see Marsh on his way to the rocket. Various gadgets are put on Marsh, he rises to the platform, says warm goodbye to the Colonel, and puts the helmet on. Inside the ship Marsh is fastened and final tests take place before he is left alone with his nerves. The last five minutes are long, Marsh thinks about his planet and parents, and then the ship sets off. Minutes seem an eternity, the first phase is behind, and upon reaching the peak velocity the speed starts to drop back. The free-flight orbit is reached and Marsh hears General Forsythe's earthly and calming voice. All the indicators are good and Marsh gets excited to be the first one to leave the rocket and look at the globe from space. He takes all the precautions and the first glance \"downward\" makes him feel like the king of the universe. Suddenly, he feels like he is falling and makes a forbidden movement, which leads to him bouncing from and back to the rocket a couple times, when he has to try hard to stop. When he calms down after the fright, he starts describing what he sees. General orders Marsh to go back and he returns to his cabin. The hardest part begins, as the speed of the ship is high and needs to be reduced. When Marsh succeeds in doing so, the ship heads back to Earth. Marsh has to make a couple spirals and near the airport the braking fuel is gone.

He finally falls asleep until the alarm goes off in the morning and prepares himself for the big day. Marsh's parents pretend to be happy the next day, but he knows that they do not want him to go. They try to convince themselves that he will be the Farnsworth family celebrity and completely safe in the rocket. When his father drops him off, they share a brief goodbye, and he begins to go through his pre-flight examinations. Further instructions regarding Marsh's take-off time and position are given to him. He manages to sleep for a few more hours before he talks to Colonel Tregasker. The Colonel wishes him luck and brings in ten more cadets who would be Marsh's replacement should he fail the trip. He then escorts Mash to the ship once the speaker announces that there are less than thirty minutes. There are crowds of photographers and newspapermen in the area, looking for a chance to interview Marsh. However, the Colonel leads him to a blockhouse where he puts on his space gear. He puts on a multitude of gadgets, and the two of them get into the cage that takes them to the platform of the third stage. Marsh begins to feel fear, even though there are workmen and engineers preparing the compartment because he also thinks that this may be his death chamber. He says his goodbye to the Colonel, and a man hands him his helmet. He waits inside the compartment, and the rocket launches soon after. The rocket then fires, and Marsh begins to see the mach numbers rise. After seeing the other parts rise, the voice of General Forsythe speaks to him and tells him that everything is going fine so far.

He is plastered with different wires to convey information back to the station about his state. They move to the elevator that takes them to the door hatch of the rocket. They say their goodbyes and Marsh steps into the compartment. Some final tests are done and then the countdown begins. The rocket blasts off, Marsh being thrown back in his seat in agony. The first part of the rocket breaks off, then the second, until he is left with just his compartment outside of the atmosphere, just as planned. When Marsh gets into a steady orbit, he exits the cabin, attached to the ship by his tether. He talks to the general about what he can see of Earth. He then looks under his feet and gets the sense of falling and becomes panicked, pushing himself to the end of his tether, and then knocking against the ship, back and forth. He eventually regains himself and re-enters the cabin. After that he starts his initial descent, swerving in and out of the atmosphere to avoid burning up on re-entry.

The rocket consists of three parts, where two of them will fall off after the fuel are used and before entering into the orbit. \n\nThe story starts with Marsh having a bad dream about not able to make it to space and back. Apparently, he is not the only one worried, so are his parents. The next morning, his parents tries to act as if they are glad for him, but later his mom was not able to hold it anymore, luckily Dad is able to stop her so that the morning will not be filled with sadness. After Dad drives Marsh to Skyharbor, where the rocket will be blasting, they quickly said goodbye to each other, and Marsh goes to get a physical examination and a briefing. After a quick nap, he is woken up by the colonel and greets his classmates whom he went through the trainings with. \n\nWhen it was thirty minutes until the blast off, the colonel escorts Marsh to the ship to have his gears put on except his helmet. Then, he takes the lift that gets him to the platform surrounding the rocket, where he puts on his helmet and steps into the ship to make sure everything works fine. The countdown goes to zero and the rocket rises into the sky. \n\nAs he keeps on rising, the two parts of the rocket drop as they are supposed to. Then he successfully goes into the orbit as predicted. After a few minutes, he gets the order to leave the rocket. Where he sees the stunning view of Earth from space. Despite a small accident with no injuries, his trip outside the rocket goes well. Then he is ready to get back to Earth. He uses his skills and talents, after a long time, he finally lands safely. After a few seconds of aloneness, men come running and congratulating him. "

        "Query": "How does Marsh's emotional state evolve throughout THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE?",
        "Article": " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep> \n \n  THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE\n  \n \n  Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a\nnightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.\nAfter recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously\nat himself. \u201cHere I was picked as the\nmost stable of a group of two hundred cadets,\u201d he\nthought, \u201cand chosen to make man\u2019s first trip into\nspace, yet I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n  \n \n  He got out of bed and went over to the window.\nFrom his father\u2019s temporary apartment, he could\nsee distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into\nspace tomorrow night. He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n  \n 10\n  \n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n  \n \n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n  \n \n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n  \n \n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n  \n \n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n  \n \n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

        "Summary_1": "During his last night on Earth, Marsh appears to be tense and scared, blaming himself for not being as strong as he wishes to be. He also feels the anxiety of his parents and is sad to see them like that. All the day before the trip, Marsh looks at everything around as if it is the last time he sees it. He feels unprepared and uneasy about parting. At the same time, he is excited, and his pulse goes up, which makes him feel unworthy of the honor. Then Marsh eases a little and even takes a nap. The atmosphere of goodbyes with his team is warm and full of good memories. When Marsh is left alone in the cabin, he becomes scared and thinks about the spectators and his parents, wondering if he sees his home ever again The countdown adds to his anxiety and the last seconds before departure seem an eternity. Marsh tries to concentrate and distract himself from the thoughts. The voice of the general brings ease and seeing how well things go, Marsh gets excited. He feels proud and extremely impressed with the view, forgetting about caution. Suddenly he is afraid to fall and makes a wrong move, which scares him a lot. Calming down after that, Marsh is able to manage himself and complete the mission. When he gets back to Earth he is full of disbelief that he made it, and he is extremely happy to smell the air of home. ",
        "Summary_2": "Marsh is initially nervous before his trip. He feels even worse by his parents' reactions but understands that he must not miss this opportunity. When he sees the doctor briefly after arriving, he cannot help but admit that he is excited to go to space. He begins to feel more at ease after the doctor reassures him and continues to do so up until he sees the rocket. Marsh's helpless feeling and anxiety come back here since he will be going to space. Once he reaches space, however, he is excited by the entirely new perspective of the galaxy he sees in front of him. There is a brief moment where he panics in the frictionless space, but he manages to control himself and becomes more careful. He then continues to try and remain calm for the remainder of the journey back home, knowing that many of the operations required to safely land must be done calmly. ",
        "Summary_3": "In the beginning of the story, Marsh is nervous and has anxiety for the journey ahead. He is sad when talking with his parents at breakfast, not knowing if they'll see them again. As he gets to the Skyharbour, he becomes trepidation, wondering if he was the right man for the job. His nerves calm after he talks with the psychiatrist, and then more as the day progresses. He gets nervous again as the rocket takes off, fearing for his life. He is overcome with joy when he gets to exit the cabin, and see the Earth from above. He is once again stricken with fear when he looks down below, floating in space. His fear starts to creep back in on re-entry, as he could burn up. Once he makes it to the ground, he is filled with a sense of relief, breathing the air he didn't know if he'd ever breathe again. \n",
        "Summary_4": "At first, he was frightened since he even got a nightmare about it. \nWhen the psychiatrist checks for his blood pressure, he confirms with Marsh if he is excited. But he was also scared and wondered if they have the wrong man; he might fail them. After the doctor tells him that he is not the wrong man, he felt more at ease. \nAs he takes the lift to get to the platform surrounding the rocket, Marsh is not as anxious as he was during the day, but his knees felt rubbery. When he talks to the officer up there, his facial expression is twitching uncontrollably despite his effort to smile. \n\nInside the rocket, he thinks of the explosives below him that can literally blow him into nothing; he thinks of being watched by millions of people; and he thinks of his parents. It fells very long before finally getting to the 10 seconds countdown. Then he feels fear. \n\nAfter getting into the designated orbit in space, Marsh feels great to hear a human voice again. \nIt was a stunning view to see Earth from outside his rocket in space. But he suddenly has a uncontrollable panic which hits him on the rocket\u2019s side. He bounces a few times, but did not get hurt. And he becomes calm again. He gets a little worried about the touchdown that his outside controls can provide. In the end, he lands safely. "

It is mentioned that they always appeared to be happy when Marsh passed various exams, but secretly wished that he had failed, so he could escape the danger. \nColonel Tregasker is proud of Marsh. He is very happy with his Cadet and his achievement. It is clear that the colonel cares deeply for Marsh, hugging him, showing his fear and anxiety for what might happen.

        "Summary_1": "Being the first man to go to space is a task of extreme responsibility. For years, the flight was worked through to make it as safe and well-organized as possible. Due to the need to choose only one man, long training and checkouts took place, and Marsh was decided to be the best. His success is the reason his friends are not able to go and their years of training were in vain. The generals and other higher standing participants trained and chose Marsh, so he has to meet their expectations. The whole globe is watching him with interest and attention, which is an additional pressure. He has to complete the mission successfully, because he was chosen and he can\u2019t fail, he needs to be brave, calm and concentrated. Moreover, he is responsible before his parents to come back, not to make them lose their only son. Detailed instructions were given to him and failing to follow them means proving not good enough. This flight was prepared for too long, and if he fails, he moves the exploration years back. Understanding all of that, Marsh tries to calm him down every time and reminds himself of what has to be done. He does everything with caution, and when he loses control in space, he rapidly recovers and reminds himself to be careful. Under the burden of this responsibility, Marsh doesn\u2019t let himself to get nervous. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The theme of responsibility is explored through the story via Marsh\u2019s own experience in space. Although he undergoes training, Marsh is still given the responsibility of being the person who makes man\u2019s first journey into space. He is responsible when piloting the rocket, too, and can execute all of the instructions that the general gives him. Marsh can safely disconnect the cables and prevent the ship\u2019s delicate instruments from becoming damaged when he goes out to observe. Even during the trickiest part of the operation, Marsh can manually pilot the ship back to Earth. He demonstrates excellent responsibility here, as he manages to safely land and successfully fulfills the mission. ",
        "Summary_3": "The theme of responsibility features heavily in this story. Marsh feels the responsibility of the world to succeed in this flight. He doubts whether he was the right man for the job. He feels the responsibility to have the mission be a success for not only his team, but also himself, and his own life. The weight of the world is on his shoulders, and the future of space travel depends on him. \nMom and Dad feel the responsibility to keep their child safe. They are angered by the fact that he was chosen, and wish the space program had picked a grown man. \nThe entire team at the Skyharbour have the responsibility of keeping Marsh safe. They give him a full medical check, and wire him up to know the status of his vitals. \nThe Colonel has the responsibility of keeping a boy safe that he has known for a very long time. He is his CO, and as such, is the main person responsible for him at the station. \nThe general has the responsibility to make sure everything about the mission goes smoothly. \nThere is definitely a very clear theme of responsibility throughout the story. ",
        "Summary_4": "We learn that even though Marsh\u2019s Mom and Dad does not want him to go to space, his exploration to the space can bring valuable finding to Earth. Firstly, he was able to spot a meteor that is heading towards Earth. He reports this back. He is also able to bring data back for months of analysis. While his parents hoped he would fail the exams, he passed and becomes the first pilot going into space. It is such an honor for him. Even Marsh himself was thrilled to see Earth from space, especially since he is the first man ever. "

Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd noticed the dewed silver pitcher, but only now realized his\nthirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untasted and said\nawkwardly, \"I haven't introduced myself.

He couldn't think of anything to say to this\nstrangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely.\n  \n \n  The rattan chair sighed under his weight.

        "Summary_1": "Jack Barry is a biology student, who sets sail on his boat \"Annie O\". He has sailed out to the furthest island off the coast of Maine. He gets to the shore and docks his boat. He sets out to explore the island. Once he reaches the summit, he finds that there is another island, connected by a thin line of rocks to the one he is on. He climbs down the slope, onto the rocks and crosses to the other side. He arrives at a gate, which he manages to overcome. Beyond the fence is a cottage, with a lawn. The whole scene is old fashioned and slightly eerie. An elderly woman comes out of the house, gets in an old car and drives away. A pretty girl, dressed like a flapper comes out. Jack walks over to her. She asks if he is the man who sends her little boxes. She tells him she lives here with her aunts. They talk for a while, Jack telling her about his professor \" Martin Kesserich\", whom he's staying with. The girl tells Jack her name is Mary Alice Pope. She says she's never been to the mainland, and that she's never met anyone her own age, let alone a man. She explains to him that every morning she receives a little box with a gift inside, and a note, signed by \"Your Lover\". She tells him she was born in the middle of the first world war, and that the year is 1933. Jack tries to convince her that it is in fact 1951. She doesn't believe him. They hear her aunt's car returning, so Jack leaves, telling her he'll be back tomorrow. He makes his way back to the Annie O. Once at sea, he sees the chug boat of one of Mary Alice's aunts, who points what looks like a rifle at him, before turning away to go back to the island. When Jack returns to his professor's home, he asks Mrs Kesserich about Mary Alice. She informs Jack that Mary Alice was the love of her husband's life, who died in 1933. Martin arrives home, and begins a hypothetical discussion with Jack about the possibility of recreating a human being. If you could take the same DNA as the original, and put the copy in the same circumstances as the one before, they would be the same. He tells Jack that he won't be here the following day. Jack wakes up the next morning and sets off for the little island. He brings with him newspapers from the present day to try and convince Mary Alice the truth, that it is in fact 1951, and not 1933. He tells her that she has been a victim of a conspiracy to make her believe it is a different year. He asks her to come back to the mainland with her. She then tells him that she can't, as the man who sends her the boxes is coming tonight. ",
        "Summary_2": "Jack Barry is a biology student under Professor Martin Kesserich, spending the summer studying marine biology. Though he is advised not to sail to the farther islands, one day he decides to anyway, taking his sailboat to a quiet cove. As he sets foot on the island and begins to explore, he realizes that there is another island hidden behind it. Awestruck, Jack heads towards the island and comes across a barbed fence, and beyond it, a cottage. He watches as a woman dressed in a long lace dress enters a car in the driveway and drives off. He then sees a girl in a white dress come out of the cottage, holding a newspaper. Jack approaches the girl, startling her, and she asks him whether he is the man who has been sending her boxes. Jack asks the girl questions, revealing that the woman from earlier is the girl's aunt, who brings her newspapers and other things from the mainland while she remains on the island. The girl offers Jack some lemonade, and he introduces himself, and in return the girl gives her name: Mary Alice Pope. Mary reveals that Jack is the first man she has met in real life, and that though she feels loneliness, she is greeted each morning with a small box containing a gift, all addressed from her \"lover\". Upon asking when the last time Mary visited the mainland was, she says that she was born eighteen years ago, in the middle of the World War. Perplexed, Jack notices that the newspaper Mary is holding is dated 1933. He asks her about the old newspaper, but Mary believes the newspaper is recent, that the current date is 1933 and not 1953, the actual date. Inside the cottage, Jack notices an old recording playing. In a terrified panic, Jack hurries back to his ship as Mary's aunt returns, promising to be back soon. As Jack scrambles to his boat and heads back home, he notices another boat overtake him, steered by a woman resembling those back on the island, but the boat turns back around. Back at the Kesserich's place, Jack asks Mrs. Kesserich if she knows of Mary Alice Pope. Mrs. Kesserich explains that Mary Alice Pope was Martin's fiancee, who died in an accident in 1933; Martin was intensely in love with her, but his sisters disliked her, and one night while waiting for Martin to arrive by train, she fell into the tracks and was killed. Suddenly, Martin enters, eager to tell Jack about his new discoveries about recreating individuals; specifically, about how it could be achieved if you replicated environments for both individuals. Jack comes to a realization, and the next morning he hurries over to the island. He brings recent newspapers for Mary, explaining that she is being manipulated to believe that it is 1933 on purpose. Mary is reluctant and frightened, and Jack tells Mary to follow him.",
        "Summary_3": "Jack Barry sails his boat called the Annie O into a cove. Once he is close enough to the ledge, he scrambles onshore and throws a line around a boulder. He has sailed to the farthest island out from the coast of Maine and decides to look around some more. He enjoys exploring but is surprised to see signs of human life on the island. He sees an older woman come out to drive an ancient Essex. Soon after, a younger girl in a white silk dress emerges too. Jack takes this opportunity to speak to her, and she asks if he is the one sending little boxes. When he says no and explains his reason for being on the island, she says that she and her three aunts live in the area. He tells her that he is a Biology student studying marine ecology under Professor Kesserich, the greatest living biologist. The girl introduces herself as Mary Alice Pope, and they have a conversation about why Mary must be alone all the time. She tells him that she receives boxes from and letters somebody signed \u2018Your Lover\u2019 for as long as she can remember. Jack notices that she has a paper from 1933, and she tries to convince him that it is from the day before yesterday. Mary brings him into the house to show him more proof, and he finds it extremely odd. He then leaves the island on his boat once they hear her aunts coming back. Jack then visits Mrs. Kesserich, who informs him that the original Mary Alice Pope was Martin Kesserich\u2019s fiancee and died in an accident in 1933. She explains how his sisters, Hilda and Hani, hated her for stealing Martin away. However, when the three of them went to visit him during his research on growth and fertilization, they could not prevent Mary Alice\u2019s death. Suddenly, Martin Kesserich comes home. Martin and Jack then have a conversation about individuality, to which the professor reveals the possibility of controlling heredity by will. Jack begins to grow concerned, but Kesserich dismisses his thoughts and changes the topic. The next day, Jack buys half a dozen newspapers when he has his clam chowder and goes back to the island to find Mary Alice. She tells him to go away quickly because he is a wicked man, but he shows her the newspapers. Although Mary Alice tries to reason, he tells her to come with him to prove that she is being made to live a lie that has cut her off from the world.\n",

She takes him for someone who has been sending her boxes with some presents accompanied by a note from 'your lover'. Turns out, the girl lives with two aunts who bring her newspapers, books and movies, while she stays home and never goes to the mainland. The man introduces himself as Jack Barry and tells about his marine ecology research for a great biologist Professor Kesserich. Jack lives with the professor and his wife, who told him not to go to these islands and thus stimulated his curiosity. Mary, the girl, tells about being born eighteen years ago in the middle of World War I and startled when Jack sees a headline about Hitler in her newspaper. The girl claims this newspaper dated the year 1933 is two days old while the man knows it is the year 1953. Jack follows her into the house and hears old news on the radio and an approaching car, Mary asks him to leave. He runs towards his boat and sets sail, far away he sees a motorboat and a woman with a rifle. Back home Mrs. Kesserich tells him Mary Alice Pope was Martin Kesserich's fiance and died in a railway accident in 1933. She also shows a photo of the girl Jack met earlier that day. Martin was deeply in love with Mary and his sisters hated her for that. One day all three of them were waiting for Martin's train on their horses and Mary's rushed before the train. Suddenly, the professor returns home and his wife's story ends. The two men talk about biology and the professor brings up the topic of recreating the same individuals. Next day Jack buys modern newspapers and visits Mary. Jack proves to her that the year is 1953 and begs to come with him to the mainland.

        "Article": "The Movement met in what had been the children's room, where unpaid\nladies of the afternoon had once upon a time read stories to other\npeople's offspring.

He\nstood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane.

But what was the\nlight? And what were these other things in the room?\n  \n \n  Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like\nhaving tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was\nlooking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could\nsee made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could construct\na logical explanation for that with no trouble\u2014maybe a subspace\nmeteorite striking the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  , an explosion, himself knocked\nout, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more\nholes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.\n  \n \n  How to explain a set of Gibbon's\n   \n   Decline and Fall of the Roman\nEmpire?\n   \n  A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the\nchemistry set\u2014or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric\nthat, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing\nsuit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of\nthe objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair\u2014why,\nhe'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old\nenough to go to school. But what were they doing here?\n  \n \n  Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were\nstrange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were\nnot papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made\nof some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or\nprocessed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light.\nBut they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"\u2014the color of aged\ndriftwood or unbleached cloth.\n  \n \n  Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth\nwall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings;\nfrom them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be\nventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse\nthan what he already had.\n  \n \n  McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a\nlittle light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his\ncourage flowed back when he could see again.\n  \n \n  He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago\u2014subjectively it\nseemed to be minutes\u2014he had been aboard the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  with\nnothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting\none of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being\nshaken up and\u2014he admitted it\u2014scared damn near witless, he did not\nseem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much what\nhad happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?\n  \n \n  He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been\nan accident to the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a\ncooling brain.\n  \n \n  McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow\nrefreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head\nhe remembered what a spacesuit was good for.\n  \n \n  It held a radio.\n  \n \n  He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest\nof the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he\nsaid, \"calling the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling\n   \n   Jodrell\nBank\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\"\n  \n \n  But there was no answer.\n  \n \n  Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio,\nsomething more than a million times faster than light, with a range\nmeasured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer,\nhe was a good long way from anywhere.\n  \n \n  Of course, the thing might not be operating.\n  \n \n  He reached for the microphone again\u2014\n  \n \n  He cried aloud.\n  \n \n  The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than\nbefore.\n  \n \n  For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped\nhis eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in\nthe pinkish glimmer; but the hand\u2014his own hand, cupped to hold the\nmicrophone\u2014he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting\nmoment of study, his chest.\n  \n \n  McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Someone else could.\n  \n \n  Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination\nof a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new\nantibiotic\u2014and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked,\nsailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that\n   \n   may\n   \n  contain food.\n  \n \n  Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\")\nHatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but\nit did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in\nany way look like a human being, but they had features in common.\n  \n \n  If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance,\nthey might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an\nadventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences\nof his culture. Both enjoyed games\u2014McCray baseball, poker and\nthree-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human\ndescription. Both held positions of some importance\u2014considering their\nages\u2014in the affairs of their respective worlds.\n  \n \n  Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot,\nhard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were\nnot organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which\nobeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes\ncurl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well\na yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested\nin the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater\ndistances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of\nInverse Squares.\n  \n \n  Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\"\nwhich had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little\nexcited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on\nvarious errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest\nlimbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a\nstate of violent commotion.\n  \n \n  The probe team had had a shock.\n  \n \n  \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the\nothers mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the\nspecimen from Earth.\n  \n \n  After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.\n\"Incredible\u2014but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report. Watch\nhim,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to\nwatch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of\nthem could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of\na creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as\nHerrell McCray.\n  \n<doc-sep>He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and\nnow, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading\nmachine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\n  \n \n  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean\n   \n   through\n   \n  the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened\nit. It's only a door.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" said Rikud.\n  \n \n  \"You will what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"\n  \n \n  A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?\nThere's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of\nbreath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,\nand Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other\nend of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,\nRikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\n  \n \n  He missed the beginning, but then:\n  \n \n \n   \u2014therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this\ndoor. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the\nrigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may\nhave discarded it for something better\u2014who knows? But if you have\nnot, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship\nis a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is\nhuman-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not\npermit it\u2014within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and\nto avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be\npermitted through this door\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing\nwords. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting\nthan that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another\nvoice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.\n  \n \n  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle\nhumming, punctuated by a\n   \n   throb-throb-throb\n   \n  which sounded not unlike\nthe booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't\nblast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's\neyes\u2014he blinked and looked again, but it was still there\u2014cogs and\ngears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because\nthey shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\n  \n \n  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but\nno one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\n  \n \n  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might\nexist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one\nopened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\n  \n \n  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The\nviewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,\nalthough it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography\nwas different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had\nthought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way\noff in the distance.\n  \n \n  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his\nhand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new\nviewport. He began to turn the handle.\n  \n \n  Then he trembled.\n  \n \n  What would he do out in the garden?\n  \n \n  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly\nthought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud\ncouldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt\ndry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.\n  \n \n  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back\nthrough the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally\nthrough the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\n  \n \n  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did\nnot dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and\nsweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the\ngarden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could\nwalk and then might find himself in the garden.\n  \n \n  It was so big.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "One day, Jack Barry goes to explore the little islands off the coast of Maine.  He docks his boat on the first island inside the cove, looking back through its high walls at thousands of tiny islands, dotting the blue sea, and the thin line that is Maine in the distance. Another island is revealed. It is connected to the first by a spine of rocks. At the near side of the second island is a short slope, covered in grass and trees. Beyond the trees is a huge chicken wire fence, topped with barbed wire. Beside the fence is an oak tree, with a low hanging branch. Beyond the fence is a quaint little cottage. There is a neatly mowed lawn in front of it, with a gravel driveway reaching out into the distance. There is another house on the summit of the island, a treehouse, and a chug boat moored in the bay. Jack then returns to the stark, square home of the Kesseriches. There is a solemn, cold air to the place, one that is reflected in Mrs Kesserich. The story then flashes back to the setting in which Mary Alice and Martin Kesserich lived. It is a nondescript place, but one that is open enough to ride horses in, hills sloping down onto train tracks. ",
        "Summary_2": "The beginning of the story takes place on an island far from Wood's Hole off the coast of Maine, with a quiet, narrow cove that opens into a rocky and green shore. There is another island connected to the first by a spine of rocks, and through the trees and past a fence of barbed wire there is a quaint cottage. The cottage is white with a gravel driveway, and it is decorated with dainty vintage furniture. The inside of the cottage is also decorated with old furniture, dark and brassy. The story also takes place at the Kesserich's residence, a large, lavish house.",
        "Summary_3": "The story is initially set on an island that Jack sails to with his boat. The island has rocky ledges by the water and a little green sloop with more rocks and oaks. As he goes further, he notices another higher island that is joined by a rocky spine. The landward part of the spine houses another cove, and he even sees the spheres of sea urchins. There are also many branches of oak and a barbed mesh fence surrounding a white Cape Cod cottage. The cottage itself has a radio aerial stretched along the length of the roof. There is also a short, square-lined ancient Essex parked near the cottage too. Inside the cottage, there is solid old furniture, a small-windowed room, a fireplace, and brass andirons. When he visits Martin Kesserich\u2019s house, it is white and weathered on the outside, with sharp-paned windows. However, the inside of the house has dark, gleaming furniture, Persian rugs, and bronze vases.",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins on an island in a narrow quiet cove near the bustling Atlantic with rocks all around and a boat carried away by wind. The place is unusually quiet compared to others on Earth, surrounded with steepness at first, and going downhill further. The island is surrounded by other islands. Further into the trees there is a huge fence with barbed wire and a mown lawn, a cottage and an ancient car are inside. A woman enters the car and drives away. A girl emerges soon with a newspaper, puts it on the table and watches a squirrel on the lawn. After sitting at the table outside with glasses of lemonade, the girl and the stranger enter the house. The room is dark and small-windowed with old furniture and a fireplace. From there, Jack runs through the lawn, jumps over the fence, runs through the oaks and rocky banks towards his boat and sails to the cross waves. From the middle of the waves and the wind the island seems small. The story moves to Kesserich's house which is a simple white cube with a cupola from the outside but luxurious and dark inside. Jack talks to Mrs. Kesserich in the drawing room and then they move to the gloomy cabinet. Next day Jack wakes up in an empty house and he goes to the same island to visit Mary. The setting changes - it is no longer still, conveying the eerie mood. "

        "Article": "II\n  \n \n  The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home\u2014a weathered white cube with\nnarrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola\u2014was nothing like its\nlavish interior.\n  \n \n  In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming\nfurniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n  \n \n  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n  \n \n \n \n  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n  \n \n  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n  \n \n  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon.

She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n  \n \n  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question\u2014he\nwas much too dazed for that\u2014he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n  \n \n  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him\u2014or rather about the three of\nthem.\n  \n \n  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud\u2014I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant\u2014and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n  \n \n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>III\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep>With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n  \n \n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n  \n \n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n  \n \n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n  \n \n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n  \n \n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n  \n \n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n  \n \n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n  \n \n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home.\n  \n",

Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n  \n \n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>III\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep>IV\n  \n \n  Morning sunlight brightened the colors of the wax flowers under glass\non the high bureau that always seemed to emit the faint odor of old\nhair combings. Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked\nthe sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering\nabout Kesserich and his wife\u2014things said and half said last night\u2014but\nfound instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as\nif to a farthest island in a world of people.\n  \n \n  Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet\u2014he\nfelt behind it, but the key was gone\u2014he hurried down to the\nwaterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an\nafterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.\n  \n \n  The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  There\nwas eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the\nmast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous\nwith faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.\n  \n \n  After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky\nspine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures\nstruck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.\n  \n \n  This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the\ninnocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd\nbrought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence\nwhen he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.\n  \n \n  He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the\nsame time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.\n  \n \n  The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to\nspeak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never\ncome back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've\nbeen watching for you all morning.\"\n  \n \n  He tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read\nthem now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the\nheadlines.\"\n  \n \n  When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She\ntried unsuccessfully to speak.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You've been the victim of a scheme to make\nyou believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's\n1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I\nthink I know who you really are.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" the girl faltered, \"my aunts tell me it's 1933.\"\n  \n \n  \"They would.\"\n  \n \n  \"And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.\"\n  \n \n  \"The papers are old ones. The radio's faked\u2014some sort of recording. I\ncould show you if I could get at it.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   These\n   \n  papers might be faked,\" she said, pointing to where she'd let\nthem drop on the ground.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said. \"Only old papers get yellow.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why would they do it to me?\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you straight quicker\nthan anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't,\" she said, drawing back. \"He's coming tonight.\"\n  \n \n  \"He?\"\n  \n \n  \"The man who sends me the boxes ... and my life.\"\n  \n \n  Jack shivered. When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. \"A life\nthat's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world. Come with\nme, Mary.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Kesserich devises an elaborate, maniacal scheme to cope with the loss of his beloved fiance Mary Alice Pope. He takes his dead loves ova, and through some kind of unknown science, creates a clone of Mary Alice. He brings the baby to a hidden island, in a cove with high rock walls to keep any intruders out. He creates a setting on the island to seem as if it is 1916. He builds an english cottage with a neat lawn and a eight foot high fence surrounding it to keep unwanted visitors out, and his fiancee's copy in. He employs his two sisters, who are forever devoted to him to raise the child, as if it were this time period which he has fabricated. He sends the girl notes every day, since she was first born, along with gifts like flowers. The notes are always signed with \"Your Lover\". This is all in an attempt to create an exact replica of Mary Alice, in mind, body, and spirit at the very moment he lost her. He has put her in a place made to mimic england, which she grew up in, and the time period as well. By the end of the story, the new Mary Alice is the exact age when the original died. It is Kesserich's plan to finally meet this girl, who has been closed off completely from the outside world.",
        "Summary_2": "To cope with the loss of Mary Alice, Martin Kesserich uses his scientific ability. He has been working on potentially being able to recreate another individual at will, to make an exact copy of someone else. Kesserich believes that this can be achieved through biological manipulation as well as mirroring the environment that the individual had experienced. Martin is doing this exact practice on the far out island, where the Mary Alice that Jack encountered is being made to believe that it is 1933, and that she is experiencing past events in real time. Martin is also sending Mary gifts each morning, calling him her lover, in order to manipulate Mary's life into being as close to his late fiancee as possible; Martin believes he can bring Mary Alice back to life, in a way, by recreating her.",
        "Summary_3": "To cope with the loss of Mary Alice, Martin Kesserich is trying to create an exact duplicate of her. He indirectly reveals this in his conversation with Jack. He discusses that controlling heredity and environment can essentially allow somebody to create a duplicate individual whenever they want. This revelation means that the Mary Alice Pope, who Jack meets on the island, is the exact duplicate that Martin Kesserich tries to create by making her physically the same and controlling every aspect of her living environment. She is kept away from the mainland so that no external influences can change her from the original Mary Alice. ",
        "Summary_4": "Martin Kesserich delved into the research regarding the control of heredity and environment in order to recreate an individual. He considered environment to be not as important as heredity and he recreated the hereditary traits of Mary Alice. He placed this recreation on an isolated island nearby with two women looking over her while she grew up. He married his assistant without any warm feelings and has been living with her awaiting for the new Mary Alice to come of age. He has been sending her boxes with incredible gifts and signing 'your lover'. He made her believe she was born around 1916 and the year 1953 to be 1933 in order to recreate the environment. He even kept supplying her with the old newspapers. He wanted to meet her at the same age as the initial Mary Alice was. He never coped with the loss and put his effort and study into this recreation. \n"

He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n  \n \n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n  \n \n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n  \n \n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n  \n \n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n  \n \n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n  \n \n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow.

Look around.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n  \n \n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n  \n \n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n  \n \n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man!

I never heard of a street like that.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n  \n \n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n  \n \n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n  \n \n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n  \n \n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n  \n \n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n  \n \n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n  \n \n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house.

He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n  \n \n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n  \n \n  The building appeared harmless enough.

        "Summary_1": "The newspapers are such an important part of the story because they are an indicator as to the different characters' understanding of the time period. On the island, Mary Alice is surrounded by many items and artefacts to gaslight her into thinking that the year is 1933. These include the old fashioned car and radio, which plays news from the past. The one main item used to convince her are the newspapers. Hani and Hilda, who refer to themselves as her \"aunts\", give her a new newspaper every day with the date on it. It is a way for her to keep track of the passing time, albeit incorrect. When Jack Barry sees these newspapers and exclaims that they are wrong, Mary Alice is understandably shocked, and doesn't believe him. She doesn't know that newspapers aren't supposed to be yellow, because to her, newspapers have always been yellow. They are also very important to her because even though they are false, they are her only connection to what the outside world is like, apart from the radio, film and books. They are the real time news of what is happening in the world. At the end of the story, Jack Barry takes some current newspapers, in the hopes that he can convince her that the ones she possesses are decades old, and that she is, in fact, living in 1951. She doesn't believe him at first, pointing out that the papers he has could be fake, but when he states that only old papers are yellow, it seems that she begins to believe him. ",
        "Summary_2": "The newspaper that Mary is holding when Jack first meets her is visibly old and yellowed, and dated from 1933. This newspaper is what initially makes Jack realize that something is off about Mary and the island. The newspapers are a critical part of Martin's plan in recreating his fiancee in a new individual. He delivers the old newspapers to make Mary Alice believe that the events are happening in real time. In fact, when Jack tries to explain to Mary Alice that she is being manipulated, she uses the old newspapers as her own proof that she is truly in 1933.",
        "Summary_3": "Newspapers are an important part of the story because they reveal the lies told to Mary Alice. When she first meets Jack, she shows him the yellowed newspaper and says that it is the morning news from the day before yesterday. When Jack points out that the paper is from many years ago, she refuses to believe him and even implies that he is lying to her. The newspapers also help lead Jack to ask Mrs. Kesserich about Mary Alice Pope and why she believes she is living in 1933. Later, the newspaper from present-day that Jack buys finally convinces Mary Alice that she is living in a simulated lie. Although she is initially suspicious, he does manage to make her see the truth and question why the people around her would lie to her. ",
        "Summary_4": "For the girl the newspapers are almost the only way to learn something about the world and to divert herself as she is never brought to the mainland. They are also the way Jack learns about her being tricked. He proves his point of it being the year 1953 also by bringing newspapers. Mary's newspapers are yellow which proves their age. The tool for creating the lie and the tool for destroying it is the same in the story. With the help of contemporary newspapers, Jack is able to convince the girl to believe him and to save her from deception. The whole plan of the professor is ruined mainly because of the newspapers.

His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open.

Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room.

        "Summary_1": "From his shelf Michael watches a juice advertisement. Then a nearby passenger starts a conversation regarding Michael's belonging to a Brotherhood. Michael remembers how the Father Superior proposed the idea for him to live in the outside world to answer the question about reasons for the Brotherhood's resignation from it. The young man makes one mistake after another, violating the laws of the Universe during the short conversation with his respectable companion. The least warns the youth against those mistakes and lets him stick close for a while, then the two listen to the Sirians singing. Suddenly, it turns out that Zosma has joined the United Universe and its rule to always cover the head becomes Universal starting that second. Upon the arrival to Portyork, Michael and his companion cautiously head to eat, and the man keeps enlightening the newcomer. Then they take a ride through the city with Carpenter constantly explaining Michael his new mistakes. During a short following walk, Michael says \"history\" and unintentionally deeply offends a man, who is urged by Carpenter not to report. Then Michael asks for a shower, and they take a taxi to a public lavatory. Advideos keep appearing and annoying the two everywhere. Then Carpenter wants to find a temporary family for Michael to make his stay legal, but the least mentions the desire to create his own permanent family and marry the girl he likes. This statement is the turning point, Carpenter is shocked with the youth's ignorance about marriage being outlawed. Michael in turn is frustrated with the idea of having to share his girl and decides to return to the Brotherhood. Carpenter is even more shocked by the news of both sexes living there together and belonging to one another, so he considers Michael simply unfit for the civilized and comfortable life. Michael, on the contrary, already dreams of coming back home. He takes the same bus and then the same taxi to his Brotherhood. ",
        "Summary_2": "Michael Frey is a member of one of the Brotherhoods, and he leaves his home to explore the outside world. The stranger he talks to asks him why he would join one, and he explains that his father brought him to the Angeleno Brotherhood when he was an infant. The United Universe lives in peace and never engages in wars with one another because every citizen must adapt to the customs of another one. Michael questions Father Superior about the ways of the Brotherhood before coming, and the Father suggests him coming to experience the life of civilization. He meets Pierce B. Carpenter, who hands him a business card and explains that aphrodisiacs are his line of business. He and Michael begin discussing the rules by the United Universe, and Carpenter warns him of the various rules, such as appearing in public with bare hands and that he must be careful. Michael retrieves a pair of yellow gloves from his pack, but Carpenter tells him that wearing yellow is the color of death on Saturn. He settles for rose-colored gloves instead. Carpenter offers to guide him through his stay in Portyork so that Michael will not run into any problems with the law. A stewardess goes around and announces that everybody must now wear some form of head-wearing because of Zosma\u2019s admittance into the Union. Carpenter tells Michael that the universe is constantly expanding, which means that there must be constant updates. He then takes Michael to a \u201cFeeding Station\u201d for some food and offers to take him to the Old Town after. Michael mentions wanting to go to a hotel, but Carpenter explains he should not say these words because of the laws. The two go to Times Square, where the aliens are currently preparing for Christmas. Carpenter continues his tour to a few more locations, such as the Empire State building and Broadway. After, Michael gets himself washed, and Carpenter tells him that they must register him for a family now. Michael mentions getting married to his girlfriend soon, to which Carpenter shockingly tells him not to use that word because it is banned on Earth. He explains that Michael would have to share his girlfriend if he chooses to bring her here. Michael declares that he wants to go back to the Brotherhood, and Carpenter agrees, telling him that he does not adapt well to civilized behavior. Michael goes back to the ancient taxi again, where the driver is not surprised to see him back. He gives one last insult to civilization, which the taxi driver warns him about, and feels content to go home. ",
        "Summary_3": "Michael Frey is a member of the Angeleno Brotherhood, a rural city in comparison to largest spaceport in the United Universe, Portyork. The United Universe consists of many different worlds and is expanding at all times. The story begins with Michael on a jet bus heading towards Portyork looking for a job. He imagines bringing his girl over to get married once he settles down.\n\nMichael was so eager to leave the Brotherhood and to go explore the world that after a year of learning the tabus and customs, he boards the bus heading to Portyork. On the jet bus, Michael meets Pierce B. Carpenter, a board-minded, middle-aged man with brown hair and blue eyes. Carpenter works in the aphrodisiacs industry, and his first thought Michael joined the Brotherhood because he was troubled over a female, then Michael reveals that he has been in the Brother since he was an infant. After accused of breaking a series of laws, which includes talking about fatherhood, wondering about turning the advideo off, not covering his hands, being intolerant, and having yellow colored gloves, Carpenter offers to guide Michael around the city so that he can learn about the civilized behaviors.\n\nPrior to landing, the stewardess announces that Zosma is now a part of the Union. Since they have a custom of not showing their head in public, everyone in the United Universe has to cover their head, thus, the passengers all leave the jet bus after wearing some sort of headgear. Then, Michael states loudly that he is hungry and need to find something to eat. He is immediately rebuked by Carpenter. Everyone in the Union is not allowed to speak of eating, or use any other vulgar language in public since it is a custom for the Theemimians. After checking the map of the landing field, Michael is able to get to a \u201cFeeding Station,\u201d where he chewed on pieces of food that were meant to be swallowed. Afterwards, Michael attempts to break more customs when trying to get to the Old Town. Getting off the taxi, Michael finally offends a being who threatens to report him to the police because he has mentioned the word \u201chistory,\u201d something that the Meropians lack. Carpenter begs the being and blames himself for not warning Michael. Later, Michael interrupts Carpenter, asking for the lavatory. Thus, they get to the Empire State Building, which has been transformed into a lavatory, since, apparently, it has no other use. \n\nOn their way out, Michael mentions his desire for marriage and family with the girl he got. Carpenter is shocked since there\u2019s no marriage in the Union, and family is never permanent. Thus, Michael is determined to leave. Finally, Michael is back to the Brotherhood. He tells the taxi driver about his dislike for civilization. The driver reminds him that civilization is spreading, even to rural areas. However, Michael is happy that he is heading home. ",
        "Summary_4": "While on his way to Earth from the \"Brotherhood\" Michael meets a salesman named Mr. Carpenter. Micheal is moving to Earth in search of a new life, after his father passed away. The Brotherhood is a community that focuses on living in the ways of the past, which would be the present now, in this future society. Micheal and Carpenter begin to chat, but Carpenter soon makes Micheal aware of the social intricacies at play in this new Terran society. Earth is part of what's known as the \"United Universe\" which is a leaf of planets that was created over five hundred years ago. Each planet has different rules and customs, and to avoid conflict in this league, each planet must abide by one another's customs to avoid the chance of war breaking out. A person not abiding by those rules would face charges. Carpenter notices that Micheal keeps breaking these societal rules on their journey, and offers to take him under his wing, and show him around Earth, so he can avoid running into trouble. They arrive in Portyork, noticing all the Aliens that depart from the bus. Carpenter takes Michel to show him around, Micheal repeatedly unintentionally breaking rules. Micheal strats to get frustrated with all of these rules, not understanding the reasons behind them. The final straw comes when Micheal mentions to Carpenter that he has a girl back in the brotherhood whom he intends to marry. Carpenter tells him that marriage was outlawed a long time ago. Micheal decides that life in this civilisation is not worth it. He returns to the brotherhood and to his girlfriend. "

        "Summary_1": "The United Universe's laws are a combination of laws of every planet involved. Earth has introduced the tabu regarding offending motherhood as it is sacred. Electra has prohibited appearing in public bare handed, because its people have eight fingers on each hand and feel different from others. Yellow is forbidden to wear as it represents death on Saturn. Zosma has just joined the United Universe and introduced the necessity to cover the heads in public, which is immodest on that planet. Theemimians do not eat in public, and so do all other beings in the United Universe. Fomalhautians do not have feet and, therefore, do not walk. So, it's prohibited to walk more than two hundred yards. Zaniahansn are like bees and go everywhere with their families, therefore, one can not travel alone in the universe. Nekkarians say and imply only what is true. Meropians do not have history and this word is offending for them, and forbidden, therefore. On Talitha marriage is slavery, and so is it on other planets. ",
        "Summary_2": "There are many rules introduced to the United Universe by different planets that affect what citizens can wear, say, or even do with their lives. One of the rules introduced by the United Universe is an Earth tabu. The story says that Motherhood is sacred on Earth and the entire universe, so talking about anything that contradicts it is the same as violating the law. Another rule is that one must not violate the spirit of free enterprise and cause ego injury. This rule allows advertisers to continue creating their constant advideos. In terms of what one can wear, it is illegal on Electra to appear in public with bare hands and immodest to appear without a head covering on Zosma. Even talking about eating is considered vulgar to Theemimian, while the disgusting aroma of the Algedian cab is a scent that must be enjoyed. Meropians are also extremely sensitive to word history, making it illegal to say around them. On Earth, it is also considered unthinkable to go anywhere without a family because of the Zaniahans. Despite needing a family, marriage is illegal because it is considered slavery on Talitha. These rules are all introduced and accepted as a means of keeping the universe together. The Wise Ones believe that keeping every custom, rule, and habit the same will foster universal peace. ",
        "Summary_3": "It is considered a crime to injure another through word or action, thus customs and laws of each planet are considered laws of all other planets. Firstly, courteous is an important rule of the United Universe. Secondly, motherhood is sacred on Earth, thus it was introduced to the United Universe and all planets have to consider it sacred. Moreover, the advideos cannot be turned off since it would hurt the spirit of free enterprise; hands are forbidden to be bare in public since Electrans have eight fingers on each hand and two nails on each finger, which are covered in green scales; and yellow cannot be wore since it is the color of death on Saturn. On the jet bus, they are told that Zosma has been just admitted to the Union and the people there do not appear with bare head in public, thus from now on, everyone has to wear some sort of headgear in public. Furthermore, Theemimians are afraid of vulgar, thus any vulgar words such as eating cannot be stated in public; Fomalhautians do not walk, thus it is forbidden for everyone in the Union to walk more than two hundred yards in one direction. Ego injury is also considered a crime. Surprisingly, the word \u201chotel\u201d cannot be mentioned since it means a place of dancing girls in the current society; \u201clodging\u201d is offensive to the Zaniahans since they almost always travel with a family; \u201cmarried\u201d was outlawed years ago because Talithas consider the exclusive possession of a opposite sex as slavery; \u201chistory\u201d pisses the Meropians off since they do not have any history, they went from barbaric to civilized in one generation, and historical buildings such as the Empire State was considered useless. Finally, Times Square is actually a square because the Nekkars do not allow anything that is not true to exist; and it is illegal to interrupt someone when they are speaking. ",
        "Summary_4": "There were many rules introduced by the united universe for various reasons. It is forbidden to appear in public with your hands held by Electra because they have eight fingers, two of them being very ugly. You aren't allowed to wear yellow on Saturn, as it is the color of death. On Zosma it is illegal to appear with you head bare. On Them It is vulgar to speak about eating in public. The Fomalhaut Incas have made it illegal to walk more than two hundred feet in any direction. Because of the Zaniahan's it is forbidden to stay anywhere without one's family. On Nekkar, it is illegal to do, say or imply anything that isn;t true. The word history is not allowed because the Meropians deem it to be insulting. MArriage in earth was outlawed. \n"

        "Summary_1": "The narration begins on a bus shelf where the main character lies. Then he arrives at Portyork, a huge spaceport on Earth, where Michael and Mr. Carpenter head to the nearest feeding station following the map. There Michael alone is admitted into a tiny room to eat. When he finishes, the two take a trip to the Old Town by taxi. In the cab they crossed Portyork, looking at the cosmopolitan architecture and people. They exit the taxi at Times Square which is indeed in the shape of a square and is decorated for the New Year in green and red though it's July. The two walk a little to Broadway and then. take another can to a public lavatory. There, in the elevator, Michael sees many foreigners again. When they leave the lavatory, the two have an argument and go different ways. In the next scene Michaels appears on a shelf on his way back to Angeles, to the Lodge and the Brotherhood. Upon arrival, he takes the same taxi back home. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on Earth. Michael and Carpenter initially travel to Portyork via a jet bus. There is a level on the bus that drops his pack from the storage compartment. There are also no seats on the jet bus to accommodate the numerous types of life forms. Portyork is a cosmopolitan city filled with many different forms of architecture. There are silver dome buildings belonging to Earth origins and tall, helical Venusian buildings. Many different extraterrestrials inhabit the city too. The feeding station room Carpenter brings Michael has a slot for a two-credit piece. The tiny room itself has only a chair, table, food compartment, and advideo. Times Square is a square meadow with transparent domes, housing many antique clocks that run by twenty-four hours instead of the standard thirty. There are also many green and red decorations put out to prepare for Christmas. Broadway has boogil trees from Dschubba, and the Empire State Building still looks the same as in the pictures, except there is a huge \u201cPublic Washport\u201d sign. There is a circular desk to direct traffic from and many different floors for each extraterrestrial species. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place when Christmas is almost here, it\u2019s July. It begins with the jet bus heading towards Portyork. The jet bus don\u2019t have any seats since it was proven to be the most suitable way for different life-forms. The bus has an illuminated panel on a shelf, where Michael and Carpenter lie; and there is a storage compartment on the bus, and it can drop the bags that is stored within it using a lever. \n\nThe landing field has a large map that shows the location of the \u201cFeeding Station\u201d to Carpenter. Walking into the small and austere room that has a sliding door at the station, Michael sees that there is only a table, a chair, a food compartment and an advideo, and nothing else. \nPortyork is the largest spaceport in the United Universe and the city with the most cosmopolitan architectures and diverse group of inhabitants. Eventually, Michael gets a better view of the city of Portyork on the taxi, after he gets used to the Tpiu Number Five aroma. He sees the Silver domes of Earth as well as the tall helical buildings of the Venusians, standing right next to the domes. There are houses in Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones style due to the medieval architecture revival that is taking place there. Michael also notes the streamers and red and green balls on the street, which are lit even when there\u2019s daylight. Getting off of the taxi, Michael and Carpenter arrive at the Time Square, which is actually a square now. It is filled with clocks inside transparent plastic domes, where most of those clocks are 24-hr clock; a few have 30-hr, which is the standard nowadays. Broadway is filled with shades from the boogil trees. The Empire State Building looks just like the pictures in his history book, but a \u201cPublic-Washport\u201d sign was there. There is a large circular desk in the lobby, where the attendants directed the guests to the elevators. ",
        "Summary_4": "The setting of the story is earth. When we first meet Micheal, he is on a bus, travelling to Portyork. It is a city that has clearly evolved from New York. The bus is uncomfortable to Micheal, as everyone on it has to lie down. The bus finally stops on the landing field. They depart from the bus into the outer edges of the city. Micheal goes into a small, white plain building which is marked as a feeding station to nourish himself. In the building is a table and chair, a food compartment and an advideo. The heart of the city is described as \"Old Town\". Portyork is the biggest spaceport in the United Universe. There are silver domes of earth, clustered by towing edifices of the Venusians. There are red and green balls that glow, lighting the streets. There are long red and green streamers lining the streets. They are transported to a square meadow, with plastic domes containing different types of clocks dotted throughout. It is Times square. There is a lovely walkway that is lined by \"boogil trees\". It is broadway. The empire state building has been converted into a washing station and lavatory, with different floors for different species. "

A 40 credit tour is no substitute!\n   \n \n \n \n  The picture changed on the illuminated panel that filled the forward\nend of the shelf on which Michael lay. A haggard blonde woman sprawled\napathetically in a chair.\n  \n \n  \"Rundown, nervous, hypertensive?\" inquired a mellifluous voice. \"In\nneed of mental therapy? Buy Grugis juice; it's not expensive. And they\nswear by it on Merop\u00e9.\"\n  \n \n  A disembodied pair of hands administered a spoonful of Grugis juice to\nthe woman, whereupon her hair turned bright yellow, makeup bloomed on\nher face, her clothes grew briefer, and she burst into a fast Callistan\nclog.\n  \n \n  \"I see from your hair that you have been a member of one of the\nBrotherhoods,\" the passenger lying next to Michael on the shelf\nremarked inquisitively. He was a middle-aged man, his dust-brown hair\nthinning on top, his small blue eyes glittering preternaturally from\nthe lenses fitted over his eyeballs.\n  \n \n  Michael rubbed his fingers ruefully over the blond stubble on his scalp\nand wished he had waited until his tonsure were fully grown before\nhe had ventured out into the world. But he had been so impatient to\nleave the Lodge, so impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the\nBrotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world\nthat had seemed so glamorous and now proved so itchy.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" he replied courteously, for he knew the first rule of universal\nbehavior, \"I have been a Brother.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now why would a good-looking young fellow like you want to join a\nBrotherhood?\" his shelf companion wanted to know. \"Trouble over a\nfemale?\"\n  \n \n  Michael shook his head, smiling. \"No, I have been a member of the\nAngeleno Brotherhood since I was an infant. My father brought me when\nhe entered.\"\n  \n \n  The other man clucked sympathetically. \"No doubt he was grieved over\nthe death of your mother.\"\n  \n \n  Michael closed his eyes to shut out the sight of a baby protruding its\nfat face at him three-dimensionally, but he could not shut out its\nlisping voice: \"Does your child refuse its food, grow wizened like a\nmonkey? It will grow plump with oh-so-good Mealy Mush from Nunki.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" Michael replied. \"Father said that was one of the few\nblessings that brightened an otherwise benighted life.\"\n  \n \n  Horror contorted his fellow traveller's plump features. \"Be careful,\nyoung man!\" he warned. \"Lucky for you that you are talking to someone\nas broad-minded as I, but others aren't. You might be reported for\nviolating a tabu. An Earth tabu, moreover.\"\n  \n \n  \"An Earth tabu?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. Motherhood is sacred here on Earth and so, of course, in\nthe entire United Universe. You should have known that.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>In their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n  \n \n  \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n  \n \n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The final passages reflect how Michael's attitude towards the outside world has changed. The Sirians' song, which sparked curiosity in him in the beginning of the story, annoys him now and makes him miss home even more. The advideo is annoying as well, as those are all over the universe and can't be turned off. Those are the annoying features of the world about which nothing can be done, and for Michael one day was enough to get tired of them. Michael has fulfilled the purpose of his visit to Earth, he understands now why the Brotherhood is so isolated from the world and he likes it. He starts missing home and his girl in one day on Earth and gladly decides to return. The Earth experience makes him sure in how he wants to live in the future - in the Brotherhood, without the constant fear of mistakes and restrictions on every step, married to his girl. The civilization seems awful to the youth, but it is spreading, as the taxi driver says. Nevertheless, Michael doesn't care about it, he feels safe in Brotherhood, and it is definitely the right place for him.",
        "Summary_2": "The meaning of the trip back is to show Michael\u2019s development throughout the story and how he has matured into realizing that he is much more suited for life at the Brotherhood than under the rules of the United Universe. This directly contrasts his initial plan too. He, at first, wants to move to Earth and away from the Brotherhood, thinking of how it would let him start a much more exciting new life. However, the trip back shows just how unadaptable he is to the strict customs that exist and constantly expand. When he realizes this, the trip back symbolizes his maturity and realization that life back home is what is much more suited for anyways. ",
        "Summary_3": "The meaning of the trip back to the Brotherhood means that Michael does not like the way that the civilized live. He specifically mentions that he is not staying in Portyork after hearing that if he brings his girl, they cannot permanently get married, since following the custom of Talitha, one cannot have exclusive possession over one from the other sex. Simply stated, he have to share her and she have to share him if anyone wishes to have either of them. Moreover, stating that the females at the Brotherhood don\u2019t mind being generic shows that Michael does not praise the numerous tabus and customs that they have to follow simply because another planet is following it. ",
        "Summary_4": "The trip back means that the civilisation of the United Universe is spreading. Soon, the brotherhood will be taken over. There will be no trace of the old world. there will be nowhere to escape from this constant fear of saying the wrong thing by mistake, and ending up breaking the law. There will be no more love, or monogamous relationships. Micheal and his girlfriend might never get married. They might never be able to have a family. So many planets will eventually join that no one will be able to do or say anything at all, and the things that make different cultures special will be lost, as they offend another. \n"

You\n   \n   know\n   \n  when you buy Plummy Fruitcake from\nVega.\"\n  \n \n  The salesman patted Michael's shoulder. \"You staying a while in\nPortyork?\" Michael nodded. \"Then you'd better stick close to me for a\nwhile until you learn our ways. You can't run around loose by yourself\nuntil you've acquired civilized behavior patterns, or you'll get into\ntrouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you, sir,\" Michael said gratefully. \"It's very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  He twisted himself around\u2014it was boiling hot inside the jet bus\nand his damp clothes were clinging uncomfortably\u2014and struck his\nhead against the bottom of the shelf above. \"Awfully inconvenient\narrangement here,\" he commented. \"Wonder why they don't have seats.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because this arrangement,\" Carpenter said stiffly, \"is the one that\nhas proved suitable for the greatest number of intelligent life-forms.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I see,\" Michael murmured. \"I didn't get a look at the other\npassengers. Are there many extraterrestrials on the bus?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dozens of them.

But so sad.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sirians are always sad,\" the salesman told him. \"Listen.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. \"I have no immediate\nbusiness, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would you\nlike to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?\"\n  \n \n  \"Frankly,\" Michael admitted, \"the first thing I'd like to do is get\nmyself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.\"\nTwo small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously and\nscuttled off on six legs apiece.\n  \n \n  \"Shh, not so loud! There are females present.\" Carpenter drew the\nyouth to a secluded corner. \"Don't you know that on Theemim it's\nfrightfully vulgar to as much as speak of eating in public?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Michael demanded in too loud a voice. \"What's wrong with\neating in public here on Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Carpenter clapped a hand over the young man's mouth. \"Hush,\" he\ncautioned. \"After all, on Earth there are things we don't do or even\nmention in public, aren't there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, yes. But those are different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all. Those rules might seem just as ridiculous to a Theemimian.\nBut the Theemimians have accepted our customs just as we have accepted\nthe Theemimians'. How would you like it if a Theemimian violated\none of our tabus in public? You must consider the feelings of the\nTheemimians as equal to your own. Observe the golden rule: 'Do unto\nextraterrestrials as you would be done by.'\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm still hungry,\" Michael persisted, modulating his voice,\nhowever, to a decent whisper. \"Do the proprieties demand that I starve\nto death, or can I get something to eat somewhere?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" the salesman whispered back. \"Portyork provides for all\nbodily needs. Numerous feeding stations are conveniently located\nthroughout the port, and there must be some on the field.\"\n  \n \n  After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females were\nwatching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field and\npressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant.\n  \n \n  \"That's the nearest one,\" Carpenter explained.\n  \n<doc-sep>A large scarlet pencil jumped merrily across the advideo screen. The\nface on the eraser opened its mouth and sang: \"Our pencils are finest\nfrom point up to rubber, for the lead is from Yed, while the wood comes\nfrom Dschubba.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Is there any way of turning that thing off?\" Michael wanted to know.\n  \n \n  The other man smiled. \"If there were, my boy, do you think anybody\nwould watch it? Furthermore, turning it off would violate the spirit of\nfree enterprise. We wouldn't want that, would we?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no!\" Michael agreed hastily. \"Certainly not.\"\n  \n \n  \"And it might hurt the advertiser's feelings, cause him ego injury.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could I ever have had such a ridiculous idea?\" Michael murmured,\nabashed.\n  \n \n  \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" said his companion. \"My name is\nPierce B. Carpenter. Aphrodisiacs are my line. Here's my card.\" He\nhanded Michael a transparent tab with the photograph of Mr. Carpenter\nsuspended inside, together with his registration number, his name, his\naddress, and the Universal seal of approval. Clearly he was a character\nof the utmost respectability.\n  \n \n  \"My name's Michael Frey,\" the young man responded, smiling awkwardly.\n\"I'm afraid I don't have any cards.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, you wouldn't have had any use for them where you were. Now,\nlook here, son,\" Carpenter went on in a lowered voice, \"I know you've\njust come from the Lodge and the mistakes you'll make will be through\nignorance rather than deliberate malice. But the police wouldn't\nunderstand. You know what the sacred writings say: 'Ignorance of The\nLaw is no excuse.' I'd be glad to give you any little tips I can. For\ninstance, your hands....\"\n  \n \n  Michael spread his hands out in front of him. They were perfectly good\nhands, he thought. \"Is there something wrong with them?\"\n  \n \n  Carpenter blushed and looked away. \"Didn't you know that on Electra it\nis forbidden for anyone to appear in public with his hands bare?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I know that,\" Michael said impatiently. \"But what's that got\nto do with me?\"\n  \n \n  The salesman was wide-eyed. \"But if it is forbidden on Electra, it\nbecomes automatically prohibited here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Electrans have eight fingers on each hand,\" Michael protested,\n\"with two fingernails on each\u2014all covered with green scales.\"\n  \n \n  Carpenter drew himself up as far as it was possible to do so while\nlying down. \"Do eight fingers make one a lesser Universal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Is he inferior to you then because he has sixteen fingernails?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly not, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Would you like to be called guilty of\u2014\" Carpenter paused before the\ndreaded word\u2014\"\n   \n   intolerance\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no,\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\" Michael almost shrieked.

Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Eric North, a man from Earth, is lying on his stomach and thinking whether he should go down to the bottom of the canal before him, where the beauty of the fabled city of Mars calls the youth. After a short resistance, Eric surrenders to the call of the city, rushes towards it and starts beating the gate to get in. Upon hearing Eric's name, the sentinel screams it out loud and strikes the man with hatred, mentioning some kind of a legend. A crowd full of hatred gathers, but Eric manages to escape from the city. Nevertheless, it calls again and he starts pleading at the gates to be let back, even though he knows it's insane. Shortly after, Eric realizes, with the help of taking off his hat, that the beauty is an illusion and walks away on a safe distance. He figures out putting the hat on and off confuses the machine and the illusion disappears. He decides to destroy the city without exploring further not to put himself and his brother in danger. Nevertheless, turns out that Garve, the brother, followed his curiosity and went to the city. When the two meet, Garve takes off Eric's head and mentions the legend about Eric which everyone in the city believes. While heading to the city center, the two are followed and Garve asks his brother not to use the gun, which results in Eric's capture. Eric bluffs, threatening people with the prophecy, but they decide to kill him. A respected young woman, Nolette, suddenly saves him and brings before the council. There Eric learns the story of the city, which is a small colony of those who chose to remain on Mars during the drought and a machine was created there to translate thought into reality. Now people become lustful, lose their will to learn and many of those banished have lost their minds. That's why the city has to be destroyed and Eric is the instrument. Then Eric is led to his quarters in the building of the Elders, and his brother stays in the city as well, though in another place.",

A machine buried deep under the city is controlling this facade, to make the city unspeakably beautiful, luring Eric in. He tries his best to avert his eyes from the city, but sweet music pours out of it, and he goes back, banging on the door to be let in. He wears a copper helmet, designed to shield him from the fabricated beauty of the place, but it doesn't seem to work. He is met by a sentinel guarding the city, who attacks him with a sword when he tells the guard his name. He exclaims that Eric is \"Eric the Bronze''. Eric wakes up with the people of the city crowding around him. They agree to execute him, but Eric is able to escape, making it back to his ship, where he expects to meet his brother Garve. He realises that if he continues to take the helmet he is wearing on and off, he can see past the illusion of the city, for what it truly is, and escapes it's pull. When he arrives on the ship, he sees a note from Garve, telling Eric that he heard the sweet music of the city, and has gone to explore it. Eric takes two grenades and his pistol, and goes to save Garve. He scales the outer wall of the city, soon meeting Garve. He steals the copper helmet away from Eric, throwing it over the wall. He tells Eric to keep his face hidden so the people of the city won't see him. He relays how the elders of the city told him the legend of Eric The Bronze, whom they are going to see now. They are soon spotted and taken by two men to the centre of the city, where the mob plan on killing him again. Just then, a woman on a black horse appears. Her name is Nolette, The Daughter of the City. She takes Eric to the building in which the elders preside. Eric enters the room where they are waiting. They Tell Eric of how the city came to be. How the once lush Mars died, and the city was created to protect those who keep the ancient skills and science of Mars. The city is really a machine under their feet, and it can be changed into whatever an inhabitant thinks of. However, over time, the people grew drunk with the power of creation and turned evil. And so, it is time for the city to be destroyed. And as the prophecy states, Eric will be the one to carry out the destruction. They invite him to stay in the city with his brother until this time comes, and if after a while it doesn't, and the prophecy is wrong, he is free to go. ",

He refuses to look at it and walks away from the city. However, after reaching the bottom of the canal, he runs towards the city. As he gets nearer, he can hear richer music. The sentinel assumes that he is Eric the Bronze from the legend and hits Eric with his sword. The other people in the city also look at him with hatred and want to whip him. He gets so scared that he runs away. When he is attracted to come back again, he realizes that his metal helmet is able to defend the illusions for a short while. Thus, on his way back to his ship he keeps putting the helmet on and taking it off. He assumes that the helmet\u2019s electrical circuit is able to defend against the illusion for a while since it takes some time for the illusions to adjust the waves to affect him. Even though he seems very curious to learn more about the city, he decides to go back to the ship to his brother Grave North. \n\nOn the ship, Eric realizes that Grave had also heard the beautiful music from the city. While the music did not force Grave, his curiosity lead him to the city. Eric gets some explosives and goes back to the city.

Thus, he uses superstition and tells them that a Legend cannot be defeated with some simple whips. They decide to kill him instead. Before he is killed, Nolette, the Daughter of the City, carries him to the Council on a horse. There, he learns that Eric the Bronze will destroy this city. He also acknowledges that the city is a product of a machine that translates the mass will of the citizens into reality. From the Elders, he learns about the banished ones and the ancient Legend.

However, once he gives his name, the sentinel claims that he is Eric the Bronze and smashes his sword on Eric\u2019s metal hat. When Eric wakes up again, he finds many beautiful citizens staring at him with hatred. He fears what the citizens will do and runs out of the city, despite the music telling him to come back. For a moment, the illusion of the beautiful city changes to one of evil and disgust. Eric walks away from the canal and examines how the illusions have affected him. His helmet has an electrical circuit that acts as a shield against any electrical waves that may affect his brain. Although Eric wants to know more, it is too dangerous. He finds his brother Garve North and plans to make arrangements to have the city destroyed. When Eric returns, Garve tells him about seeing the city and is going down to see it again. He selects two grenades and a pistol packed with explosive pellets as he goes back to investigate with Garve. After he returns, the illusion changes once again when he has his hat on and after Garve throws his hat out of the city walls. Garve reveals that he knows about Eric the Bronze legend and is taking him to see the Elders right now. The two of them are being followed by the citizens, and Garve tries to distract them.

She takes him to a building in the city center and tells him to go inside to see The Council. Six men and Nolette sit at a conference table, and they begin to discuss him. Nolette believes he is Eric the Bronze, while Kroon explains that he is prophesied to destroy the city. The city is also a machine built to protect the small colony of those on Mars after natural changes occurred. Kroon further explains that the Elders collectively control the city\u2019s appearance, and the ancient builders prophesied that the machine would be destroyed by a man termed Eric the Bronze. The name Eric was chosen because it is an honorable name for the ancient fathers and a symbol of new beginnings for some. The Elders let Eric live with them, while Garve will live outside of the building. "

        "Query": "What is Eric's relationship with the citizens in The Beast-Jewel of Mars and how does it evolve throughout the story?",
        "Article": "Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\n  \n \n  Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\n  \n \n  Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\n  \n \n  Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared. The idea was staggering.\n  \n \n  \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\n  \n \n  Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The time has come.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\n  \n \n  Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n  \n \n  \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\n  \n \n  Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\n  \n \n  For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\n  \n \n  Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n  \n \n  \"My brother, Garve. What about him?\"\n  \n \n  \"He loves the city.

The Daughter of the City comes.\"\n  \n \n  Eric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\n  \n \n \n \n  She said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\n  \n \n  She cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\n  \n \n  Eric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\n  \n \n  After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\n  \n \n  The girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\n  \n \n  Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\n  \n \n  Eric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\n  \n \n  The door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\n  \n \n  Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\n  \n \n  There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Eric sees the citizens in the most beautiful way and is willing to join them. They, on the contrary, meet him with hatred as they hear his name. The citizens surround and try to attack Eric, they are superstitious and believe him to be the destroyer of the city from the legends. The Elders from the Council send one of them to save Eric. They also believe him to be part of the legend, but they know more about the city and the machine. They think that it's time for the city to be destroyed as it has changed, the machine doesn't do good anymore. Nolette, the daughter of the city, also believes Eric to be the legend and stops the crowd with the use of her authority from killing him. Eric is overwhelmed and he obeys the council, listening with curiosity. He also feels happiness near the girl. ",
        "Summary_2": "The relationship between Eric and the citizens of the fabricated city is a very strange, tense and violent one. The citizens believe that Eric is \"Eric the Bronze\" and man from Earth who is prophesied to destroy their city. Eric first meets a citizen at the gate to the city, when he mentions his name, the guard strikes him in the head with his sword. He is taken into the city by the guard, where the crowd debate on killing him. He is seen as a threat to their very existence. Later, when Eric returns to the city once again to rescue his brother Garve, is captured by two men, who take him to the centre of the city, also preparing to beat and kill him. He is only saved by Nolette, Daughter of the City, and the respect the citizens have for her. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The first time he enters the city, the sentinel assumes that he is Eric the Bronze from the legend and hits Eric with a sword. The citizens stare at him with red hatred in their eyes once they learn that he is Eric the Bronze, here to destroy the city. The crowd are chanting for whips. Once he escapes the city, the gate closes right behind him. Later, when he enters the city again, he is taken prisoner by the citizens once more. They look at him coldly, calculatingly and are suggesting to whip him. However, once he speaks, they stand still and fear his words. However, a few seconds later, they decide to kill him at once so that he will not keep on coming back. Despite the hatred of the citizens, the Elders are quite friendly and they tell him about this city and the legend. They tell Eric to dwell in the building, assuring his safety. Once they find out that he is not Eric the Legend, he can choose to stay or go. ",
        "Summary_4": "There is a one-sided hateful relationship between Eric and the citizens. When the sentinel first assumes that Eric is Eric the Bronze, there is a flame of blue hatred in his eyes. Even after he wakes up, all the beautiful citizens stare at him with red hate. They want ships to be brought into the city to scourge him from it and yell for whips. An older man even strikes him on the hat and back with a stick. On the other hand, Eric is confused by all of this because he initially has no idea of the prophesy until the Elders explain it. When he returns to the city again, the citizens conclude that they should kill Eric. One of the guards even prepares to slash his sword downward on Eric\u2019s neck until Nolette intervenes. "

        "Query": "In the story \"The Beast-Jewel of Mars\", what is the type of city that Eric encounters?",
        "Article": "Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\n  \n \n  Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\n  \n \n  Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\n  \n \n  Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared. The idea was staggering.\n  \n \n  \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\n  \n \n  Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The time has come.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\n  \n \n  Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n  \n \n  \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\n  \n \n  Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\n  \n \n  For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\n  \n \n  Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n  \n \n  \"My brother, Garve. What about him?\"\n  \n \n  \"He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside this\nbuilding.\" Kroon clasped his hands. \"Nolette, will you show Eric his\nquarters?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>When Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\n  \n \n  The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\n  \n \n  The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\n  \n \n  And deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\n  \n \n  He seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  And as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\n  \n \n  He stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\n  \n \n  He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\n  \n \n  He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\n  \n \n  And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\n  \n \n  The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\n  \n \n  Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\n  \n \n  The ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\n  \n \n  He opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\n  \n \n  The ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\n  \n \n  Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\n  \n<doc-sep>The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n  \n \n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n  \n \n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n  \n \n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n  \n \n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n  \n \n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n  \n \n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n  \n \n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n  \n \n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n  \n \n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n  \n \n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n  \n \n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n  \n \n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n  \n \n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The city is located on Mars. It was created a long time ago when Mars was flourishing. When most Martians left the planet because of the drought, a small colony remained in this place. Back then a machine, which is the whole city, was created to protect this small group. The machine translates thought into reality. It was used for the people in the city to receive all the necessary for life. At first, Eric considered it an illusion. The city captures thoughts with the use of a device and Eric's hat was an obstacle. Putting it on and off confused the machine and Eric was able to see the real ugliness of the city. When one gets into the radius of the machine, he is also called by it and can not refuse the city's beauty. When one doesn't look at the beautiful city, a voice still calls him. Many try to make their lustful desires real, they are banished for that and go mad. That's why the machine is not doing only good things anymore and should be destroyed in accordance with the prophecy. There is the council in the center of the city, whose Eldest know all about the origin of the machine. The members of the council, such as the daughter of the city, are respected by all the citizens. ",
        "Summary_2": "The city that Eric finds himself in is very strange, as it is not really a city at all. It is in fact, a machine buried underground. It was created so that the inhabitants that colonise this area could create whatever their hearts desired from the sand of the great deserts of mars. Beautiful music emanates out of it. The buildings of the city are towers that sparkle with jewels. In the centre of the city is a street covered in blue fur. All the people of the city seem to be more stunning than humanly possible. But the city is a lie. In truth, it holds ugliness and evil. It's inhabitants, while beautiful on the outside, are greedy, and drunk with power. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Eric first has illusions of long streets of fur, jewels, wine, and fair women. When he gets to the city, he sees high walls surrounding the city and a gate carved with lotus blossoms. While the women in the city are beautiful, they stare at him with hatred. The city has wide fur streets going toward the center. The Elder\u2019s building is cubical. It is in direct contrast with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city. In the conference room in the Elder\u2019s building, he learns that the city is very old. It dates back to when the canals has clear, green water and the deserts have plants. This city is the product of a machine that translates the mass will of the citizens into reality. He learns that the outward appearance of the city is maintained by the combined power of their imaginations. ",
        "Summary_4": "Eric finds himself in a city that is actually a machine built to protect a small colony of the remaining inhabitants on Mars. The nature of the machine itself is to translate thought into reality, which is why the Elders can build and control its outward appearance. Many of the things in the city can be made from the machine by transmuting red dust in the desert to any desired material. The construction device of the machine then assembles the material into any pattern that has been recorded from one\u2019s thought. Even with the many beautiful citizens, including Garve, after they return the second time, it is all an illusion as part of the machine. "

It keeps changing from beautiful to ugliness then while Eric goes away up the rocky sides of the canal to the desert. From there he moves to the ship. The ship is familiar to the character, though it's unlocked and empty. Eric returns to the city and starts going around the wall. Together with his brother he enters the city and heads to its center, the city seems beautiful and ugly at the same time while the helmet is still on Eric. Without it the city is more beautiful than ever. He follows his brother down a street of blue fur, then they ran from persecutors and Eric hid in a crevice between two buildings. from there some people captured Eric and moved to the center of the street.Then, Eric is saved by a girl and escapes on a horse.

It is more stunning than imagination, with bejewelled towers and a soft, sweet music that spills out over the city walls. Outside of this city are the deserts of Mars, which were once lush, and divided by streams of green water. On the desert plane is Eric and his brother's ship. Inside the city again is the headquarters where the Elders sit. It is a functional, cubic building, which is described as just as beautiful as the rest of the buildings of the city, but in a rather different way. \n",

Eric\u2019s ship has a door that leads directly to the body of the ship. There is a control board where a note from Grave is clipped. Back at the city, the street is filled with blue fur. The crevice between two buildings is used for hiding, but soon Eric is taken down the fur road to the center. The city is filled with exquisite ornaments. On the other hand, the Elder\u2019s building is cubical and in direct contrast with the city. It seems as if it is from another time. The door of this building is also very plain.

Once he reaches the city, it is illusioned to have high walls and a gate with lotus blossoms carved into it. Eric also sees a long blue street from where the sentinel stands. Once he begins to beat the door, causing his hat to fall off, the city\u2019s appearance changes to one that has misshapen gargoyles of hatred as its spires and minarets. The previously beautiful music also changes to a song of hate. Eric\u2019s ship is briefly described as having locked doors and being armed enough to destroy the city. Once Nolette and Eric reach the city\u2019s center, the building is described as a monolith from another time. It is cubical and contrasts the rest of the city with its severe line and architecture. Even the door is plain and made out of luminous plastic, giving it a more timeless beauty. Down the hallway, there is a conference room with a T-shaped table made up of the same luminous plastic as the door. Beneath the building, caverns house the heart of the machine city. When Kroon mentions the past to Eric, he says that Mars once ran clear and green with water. Instead of deserts, there were vineyards and gardens. "

        "Article": "The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n  \n \n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n  \n \n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n  \n \n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n  \n \n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n  \n \n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n  \n \n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n  \n \n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n  \n \n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n  \n \n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n  \n \n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n  \n \n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n  \n \n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n  \n \n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words.

It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage.

From another point, it leads to Eric learning more about the city and they legend. If he destroyed the city as he wanted to, he would fulfill the prophecy without knowing. He would have considered the whole city an illusion without knowing it was a machine initially created for a good purpose. His return to the city also leads to his encounter with the beautiful girl, whose presence makes Eric happy. ",
        "Summary_2": "Garve leaving the ship and following the call of the city is very significant to the plot. Before Eric realised that Garve had gone to the city, he was planning on destroying the place, with all of its inhabitants at once. Because Grave is missing, Eric must return to the city, where Garve has learned from the Elders about the legend of Eric the Bronze. Garve tries to take Eric to see the Elders, but Eric is captured by two civilians on the way. It is during this capture that Eric meets Nolette, who takes him to see the Elders. Because of Garve leaving the ship, the Elders are able to explain the history behind this mysterious city of Mars, and that he must be the one to destroy it. \n",

Knowing that Garve does not have a metal helmet nor does he has any weapons, Eric needs to go back to the city to bring Garve back. And because Eric goes back to the city, he is captured again, which leads to the next part of the story inside the Elder\u2019s building. If Garve did not leave for the city, Eric might not be captured, encounter Nolette, and learn about the city from the Elders. ",
        "Summary_4": "Garve leaving the ship and following the city's call sets up the second return to the city. Since Eric had initially planned to destroy the city, Garve's insistence on going back again prevents him from doing so. Furthermore, this second trip allows Eric to meet the Elders and not get killed by the citizens. Once he meets the Elders, he is more knowledgeable about the city's prophesy and story. It also sets up the purpose of Eric the Bronze and whether Eric North will fulfill it or not. However, this is also significant to Garve because he shows that he loves the city and wants to stay in it, directly contradicting what Eric is supposed to do to the city. \n\n"

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty.

        "Summary_1": "There is a gravely sick girl on a spaceship near Mars and the crew argues what to do. Roberds decides to pilot the ship to Earth breaking the command due to an emergency. Rat argues with him and wants to pilot the ship himself, which leads to him being forced to leave. Roberds and Peterson then explain to nurse Gray, who is looking after the sick girl, that Rat left his post once and therefore didn't warn anyone about the Sansan massacre, so now he is out of favor. The nurse, nevertheless, visits Rat in secret and asks to pilot the ship. She says the sick wants him to and Rat takes Judith, the sick girl covered in blankets, and the nurse to the hammocks on his wings. The girls then wait for him to return with another sick man who was injured after finding and saving the crashed girls in the past. Judith feels bad for breaking the law and causing so much trouble by leaving Earth, now her appendix hurts and they have to take charge of the ship and travel to a hospital on Earth. Rat returns with sick Gladney and learns that Judith and Patti Gray were attacked during their cruise to space, which is the reason they got to Mars. The trip begins, soon everyone gets thirsty and hot, Gray is hurt when the ship moves between a meteor rain, she is devastated with suffering. Rat refuses to brake and is going to make the trip in six days instead of eight. He then tells his part of the story about the Sansan massacre - he left the post to save a sick man but nobody believed it back then.",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins with Roberds yelling that he is going to pilot the ship no matter the consequences. Roberds is saying that an ill girl needs to be taken to a hospital and that he plans to take her to Earth where she can be treated. He then asks Patti for the status of Judith and she communicates that Judith is holding in but will not be able to do so for long as her health continues to fail. \n\nSeparately, Rat and Greaseball are helping complete tasks to prepare the ship for its flight to Earth. Once they are done, Greaseball tells Rat that he can go to bed. As Rat is heading to his bed, Patti whispers to him through a window. She does not want to wait to fly to Earth and asks Rat to take them instead. Rat readily agrees to do so and begins to enact their escape plan. He flies both of the girls to the ship and instructs them to be quiet on the ship so they do not attract attention. Before they head off on their trip, Rat says he is going to get Gladney and bring him too as he is also sick. When Rat returns to the ship with Gladney, they are found out and the ship begins to be attacked. One of Rat\u2019s wings is damaged in the process. Rat pilots the ship to a very fast takeoff and they head towards Earth. At the beginning of the trip, Rat finds out that Judith is ill because of her appendix. \n\nPatti continues talking to Rat and answering questions about herself and Judith. During the conversation with Rat, she begins to realize the trip is going to be very uncomfortable as the cooling system is not working and they have a very limited supply of water. Patti becomes dehydrated and grows increasingly upset about the conditions on the cramped ship. In exasperation, she repeatedly asks him how many more days they have to spend on the ship. \n\nGladney suddenly wakes up and in an excited manner tells Rat that he needs to begin braking. Gladney begins asking Patti for help in convincing Rat to apply the brakes to make sure they get to Earth safely. Rat explains that he is cutting the trip time down from an expected 78 days to just 6 days with no breaks. Suddenly, they spot Earth in the distance. Patti starts to ask Rat about the attack that the Chief mentioned earlier and Rat says that he was just trying to help someone but knew no one would listen to his story. Gladney interrupts the conversation and taunts Rat that he will be arrested when they get to Earth to the dismay of Patti. Rat replies by cryptically stating that Earth seems like a nice place but not one for him. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Gladney and Judith are two ill patients who require surgery on Earth. A Centaurian named Rat asks the Chief Consul Roberds if he can pilot the ship, but the field manager angrily denies him the opportunity. He asks Peterson to help get rid of Rat, and Rat leaves quickly. Roberds is determined to take the ship for himself because both patients will get the necessary treatment, and he mentions that Greaseball has stayed up all night, tearing the bunks and lockers out to prepare. Nurse Gray comes back after checking on the patient, and he tells her that she will be sleeping in a hammock for their eight-day trip. Gray asks about Rat, to which Peterson explains that he was part of the Sansan massacre. Rat was a member of the outpost watch, but he went AWOL from the Ganymedean colony when Mad Barry Sansan attacked and was saved by politics. Gray tells Roberds to call her if needed and then leaves the room. The story cuts to Rat helping Greaseball fill the water tanks with fuel and check the concentrated rations. Just as Rat is about to go to bed, Nurse Gray gets his attention and tells him that her patient wants him to pilot the ship. He instructs the nurse to wrap Judith up and takes them to the ship by flying. After dropping both of them inside, Rat leaves to transport Gladney. Judith laments about having learned her lesson the hard way and notices that the pilot has been gone for a long time. Just then, Rat returns with Gladney after tricking Roberds and Peterson by burning down his shack. Rat then takes off with the ship. They get thirsty from the heat, but there is only one water tank because the rest is full of fuel. The water they drink is hot because the ship itself is heating up. Gray realizes that the hammocks have also turned upside down. The ship is hell as the journey continues because of the uncomfortable conditions, lack of sleep, and increasing heat. However, Rat continues to drive the ship. Even when Nurse Gray continuously asks him how long the trip is and breaks down, he makes her get up. Gladney wants Rat to brake too, but he refuses and explains that this is a six-day journey. He also says that they will land tonight. Nurse Gray asks him about his knowledge of the attack in the Sansan massacre; Rat responds that he left his post to help a sick man in the desert when the attack happened. Gladney tells him that the police will get him the moment they land, while Rat only grins and says that Earth is not a place for Rat. Gladney realizes what he implies, but Rat tells him to shut up because he talks too much. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story opens on Mars, with Chief Roberds and Peterson speaking to Rat, a Centaurian. Peterson refuses to allow Rat to pilot an emergency surface ship to Earth after several people have fallen sick due to a space illness. The two argue briefly, before Rat storms out. As Peterson and the Chief discuss the fate of the ship, and advise that Roberds pilot the ship despite it possibly costing him his job, nurse Patti Gray appears in the doorway. She tells them that her patient, seventeen year old Judith, is falling ill quickly and asks when the trip was planned to take place. She also asks about Rat, and it is revealed that he has a record due to his role in the Sansan massacre, where he abandoned his post, causing destruction to their colony. Roberds plans to take off at dawn. However, that night, Patti finds Rat and asks him to pilot the ship; Judith requested him specifically and they fear waiting until dawn. Rat agrees, and carries them to the ship using his wings. He additionally brings Gladney along, who is also sick. As the ship prepares to take off, they are suddenly attacked with bullets. Rat is injured slightly but they manage to get away. On the ship, Rat asks Patti what is wrong with Judith, and she replies saying that she has appendicitis; Rat remarks that Centaurians do not have an appendix. There are challenges on the ship, namely the temperature and the lack of water supply; Patti and Rat are only allowed two drinks a day, and the water remains hot. As time passes, the crew begins to go mad, and Gladney erupts in rage, telling Rat to begin braking the ship. Rat reveals that they had long since passed the halfway mark, and he does not intend to brake. Gladney angrily tells Rat that the police will be waiting for him on Earth."

Grease nodded understanding.\n  \n \n  \"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\n  \n \n  Swinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n  \n \n  \"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\n  \n \n  Nothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\n  \n \n  He didn't answer, stared at her confused.

Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n  \n \n  \"When?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n  \n \n  \"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again.

He'll be back in a moment.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her.

Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\n  \n \n  To Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\n  \n<doc-sep>They did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n  \n \n  \"I have to have a drink.\"\n  \n \n  Rat stared at her without answer.\n  \n \n  \"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n  \n \n  \"Heard you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\n  \n \n  She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\n  \n \n  They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\n  \n \n  She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n  \n \n  \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\n  \n \n  Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n  \n \n  \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n  \n \n  \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n  \n \n  \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\n  \n \n  Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\n  \n \n  No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\n   \n   upward\n   \n  , beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\n  \n \n  Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n  \n \n  \"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n  \n \n  \"And now, please, just\n   \n   how\n   \n  do I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\n  \n<doc-sep>Gladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n  \n \n  \"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\n   \n   When're you going to start braking\n   \n  ,\nRat?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Not brake?\n   \n  \" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n  \n \n  \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\n  \n \n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n  \n \n  \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\n   \n   you\n   \n  !\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n  \n \n  \"Earth!\" she shouted.\n  \n \n  \"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just name it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\n  \n \n  Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\n  \n \n  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n  \n \n  \"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why didn't you explain?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\n  \n \n  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n  \n \n  \"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n  \n",

She is curious about Rat's name, but he does not tell her because it is too long. He is also helpful, instructing Gray to keep the wool blanket on to preserve body heat and keep out the cold. Even when she swings a boot at him, he takes her to the water faucet and explains why the water is so hot. However, despite being helpful, Rat is quite rough towards Gray too. When she rolls along the deck and has a breakdown about not being able to keep up, he throws a handful of water into her face. He then kicks her to get up too. When he points out Earth to them, she is extremely grateful towards him for getting them to the planet so fast. Rat and Patti Gray do not share a very personal relationship. However, she learns more about him throughout their trip, and the two of them support each other in their own ways. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Patti Gray is wary of Rat and his history. She first asks Roberds and the Chief about Rat's name, and learns the story of Rat and his betrayal during the Sansan massacre. Despite being aware of this, Patti still reaches out to Rat and asks him to pilot the ship to Earth, at the request of Judith. Patti, being unknowledgeable of piloting ships, must listen to Rat's orders reluctantly. However, she still asks him about his life and eventually his side of the story at the massacre. Patti Gray becomes increasingly frustrated with Rat due to the conditions on the ship, particularly with the water supply. She maintains a respectful relationship with Rat despite her suspicions remaining."

He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars.

His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n  \n \n  \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n  \n \n  \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that was three years ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has it been that long?

I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp?

        "Summary_1": "The crashing of the ship brings Judith and Patti to Mars where they meet two miners and then the whole crew of the spaceship including Rat. Judith wouldn't get that sick and lose the means to return to Earth if the ship didn't crash. The miners wouldn't suffer after helping the girls. Therefore, Judith wouldn't learn the lesson of breaking the law and leaving Earth.  The crashing also leads to the necessity of Rat piloting the ship and all the party suffering from heat and thirst. The whole situation of danger and limitless occurs because the ship crashed and the girl gets sick on Mars, so she needs to get to Earth immediately. ",
        "Summary_2": "The ship crashed because Judith was piloting the ship and began to experience the symptoms of her appendicitis. It is unknown whether Judith\u2019s father survived the crash. It is implied that the man that Rat helped in the desert is perhaps Judith\u2019s father. Rat helping that man is what caused him to be declared AWOL and why he might have authorities after him for his failure to report to duty. If the ship had not crashed then Judith\u2019s father would not have been alone and injured in the desert, and Rat would not have been AWOL trying to help the man. ",
        "Summary_3": "The crashing of the ship of Judith\u2019s father is what sets up the story. Nurse Gray explains that Judith took her father\u2019s cruiser as a pleasure jaunt and came over. Although the ship is supposed to be large and easy to handle, the journey ended after Judith lost control of the ship because of an attack of space-appendicitis. The ship's crashing is what leads her to be on Mars, and it is also the cause of her illness because she has not gone through the same mill that the men who live and work there have gone through. This past event also sets up the current events of Rat speed-driving the ship back to Earth to save her life. ",
        "Summary_4": "Judith's father's ship crashing leaves Judith and Patti Gray stranded on Mars. She initially wanted to recklessly travel to Mars, Gray coming along with her, and used her father's ship because it was easy to navigate. However, she was soon attacked by space-appendicitis and lost control of the ship, causing it to crash. This is significant because Judith and Patti Gray no longer have a way home, with Judith's illness becoming worse. They are desperate to return to Earth and thus resort to taking the ship with Rat as their pilot. "

They were burly and had\nthat hard, pinched-face look and wore the usual black belts. Electric\nclubs hung from the belts. Spidery looking pistols were at their sides.\n  \n \n  I didn't know whether these two had heard my crack or not.

I won't go into\nthem, except to say that I was batted from office to office like a ping\npong ball, and that, when I finally got my travel permit, I was made to\nfeel that I had stolen an original Picasso from the State Museum.\n  \n \n  I made it in a day. Just. I got my permit thirty seconds before closing\ntime. I was to take the jetcopter to Center One at 0700 hours the\nfollowing morning.\n  \n \n  In my living machine that evening, I was much too excited to work at\ntheoretical research as I usually did after a hard day of tramping\naround. I bathed, I paced a while, I sat and hummed nervously and\ngot up and paced again. I turned on the telepuppets. There was a\ndrama about the space pilots who fly the nonconformist prisoners to\nthe forests and pulp-acetate plants on Mars. Seemed that the Southem\npolitical prisoners who are confined to the southern hemisphere of\nMars, wanted to attack and conquer the north. The nonconformists, led\nby our pilot, came through for the State in the end. Corn is thicker\nthan water. Standard.\n  \n \n  There were, however, some good stereofilm shots of the limitless\nforests of Mars, and I wondered what it would be like to live there, in\na green, fresh-smelling land. Pleasant, I supposed, if you could put up\nwith the no doubt revolting morality of a prison planet.\n  \n \n  And the drama seemed to point out that there was no more security for\nthe nonconformists out there than for us here on Earth. Maybe somewhere\nin the universe, I thought, there would be peace for men. Somewhere\nbeyond the solar system, perhaps, someday when we had the means to go\nthere....\n  \n \n  Yet instinct told me that wasn't the answer, either. I thought of a\nverse by an ancient pre-atomic poet named Hoffenstein. (People had\nunwieldy, random combinations of letters for names in those days.) The\npoem went:\n  \n Wherever I go,\n  \n  I\n  \n go too,\n And spoil everything.\n  \n  That was it.

There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if\nshe had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types,\nand not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.\n  \n \n  Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed.

I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer.

A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing.

She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n  \n \n  \"I have to have a drink.\"\n  \n \n  Rat stared at her without answer.\n  \n \n  \"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n  \n \n  \"Heard you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\n  \n \n  She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\n  \n \n  They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\n  \n \n  She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n  \n \n  \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\n  \n \n  Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n  \n \n  \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n  \n \n  \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n  \n \n  \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side.

An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\n  \n \n  Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\n  \n \n  No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\n   \n   upward\n   \n  , beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\n  \n \n  Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n  \n \n  \"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback!

After attending to Judith she goes back to talk to Roberds. She informs Patti that Rat went AWOL during a very important battle. The Chief Consul explains that unrelated politics is what saved Rat from execution for abandoning his post. After her inquiry about Rat, Patti says goodnight to everyone and returns to her room for the night. Patti secretly converses with Rat and asks him to fly Judith and her to Earth right away instead of waiting for Roberds. Rat agrees to do so and flies Judith to the ship. After Rat grabs and takes Judith to the ship, Patti anxiously awaits for him to return. He eventually returns and flies her to the ship too. When they get to the ship Patti reassures Judith that there is no use in mulling over the decision to take the ship now and tries to calm her down. \n\nBecause Rat pilots the ship to a very fast takeoff, Patti, Judith, and Gladney pass out due to the forces. Patti eventually wakes up and is surprised to find out how long she was out, she then begins to talk to Rat. During the trip, Patti becomes thirsty because of the very limited supply of water and she becomes irritated when Rat tells her she cannot drink more water.

But not for some men and most boys!\n  \n \n \n  I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a\ngirl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\njam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\nhusbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet\nVenus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n  \n \n  Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n  \n \n  \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\n   \n   Family Problems of the Frontier Woman\n   \n  . \"Remember you're\na nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n  \n \n  I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\nfront of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\nhammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\ncrews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\nto run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\nreally see the\n   \n   Eleanor Roosevelt\n   \n  !\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You see?\"\n  \n \n  Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\nothers in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\ntheir own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n  \n \n  The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n  \n \n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n   \n   They\n   \n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n  \n \n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n  \n \n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "The story starts with Karl Allen, a Second System colonist, and Joe dragging their raft from the water, hoping that they will make it in time to put their names on the list. Later we learned that the list is used to pair up the females that are coming to their colony \u2013 planet \u2013 as husbands and wives. After Karl and Joe Hill finish, they still have about two hours left before the rocket lands at Landing City. On their way towards the Landing City, Karl caught himself wondering about the trip back with a girl whom he will be paired with. Apparently, they have never seen an Earthwoman, but tales seems to cherish them as hardworking and beautiful. The speaker announces that it\u2019s time to draw their numbers. Karl draws 53. Later, Joe and Karl agrees to meet later to see if they want to trade the girls that has their numbers. \n\nMacDonald and Claude Escher meet to discuss matters regarding the ratios between male and female at the colonies. Currently, there are not as many females on the colonized planets. From the beginning of the colonization, there were more adventuresome males than females, they headed for the new world but most of the females stayed behind. Thus, there are five females for every three males on Earth, while the colonies have more males. Thus those girls needs to be brought from their original planet, in this case the Earth, to colonies for those males there. Another problem, states MacDonald, is the number of men applying for emigration to colonized planets have been dropping. MacDonald considers this reasonable since it seems illogical for a male to move away from a place that has more females than males. Escher then disregards the qualification for colonization and decides to focus on making the people that don\u2019t want to colonize to colonize, whether it is through convincing or forcing. \n\nPhyllis Hanson is a thirty years old woman who desires a husband. The government\u2019s supplement offering cannot replace a husband and family. Then in her mail today, she gets a poster that tells her to come to the colonies. Though she admires the man on the poster, she thought the poster is a violation of privacy. Then we see Ruby Johnson stealing a beautiful gown from the store and then getting caught. Ruby thinks that she will simply face a small fine along with a few weeks or months in detention and that\u2019s it. She seems to have shoplifted many times that she even knows the information that the officers want. However, to her surprised, she will be charged with a 10,000 dollar fine along with ten years in prison, or she can choose to go to a colony planet and get a five-hundred-dollar bonus. She was shocked, but chooses the latter. Similarly, Suzanne is given a similar choice between shipping out to the colony or going to jail. She also chooses the colony planet. ",
        "Summary_2": "Karl Allen and Joseph Hill are doing hard work on a boat and complaining about the lack of help they are receiving. After finishing her work, Karl begins to walk along a trail and thinks about the wife draft. They continue along the trail towards Landing City where they have to walk through varying crowds and navigate the muddy streets of the city. Karl and Joseph eventually see a crowd of people in front of the rocket port office and go to inspect what is causing the commotion. The familiar poster shows a beautiful woman from Earth being advertised on the poster. They hear an announcement and follow its instructions to assemble in a line with their numbers for the wife draft. \n\nThe story switches to MacDonald and Claude Escher. MacDonald enters Escher\u2019s office and tells Escher that the departure of men from Earth to the different colonized planets has caused the ratio of women to be much higher than men, causing various issues on Earth. Escher thinks of a plan and decides that the strict qualifications for travels and need to be financially stable need to be removed. He considers using immoral methods as a solution to convince women to colonize other planets. \n\nThe story focuses on Phyliss Hanson. Phyllis finishes her job and heads to her home. She acknowledges to herself that she is not attractive while she looks at her reflection. She grows frustrated as she is 30 and longs to have a husband but she has no prospects. She receives a letter in the mail that presents an opportunity for her to solve her problem. She mails a reply to the return address in hopes of being matched with a husband. \n\nThe story then takes a look at Ruby Johnson. She sees an absolutely gorgeous gown in a store and enacts a plan to steal it. She is immediately caught by security when she steals it. She goes through the motions of the court which she has previous experience with doing. She expects a light sentence. The judge then informs her that she has 2 choices for her sentence: emigrate to a colony planet or go to jail for 10 years with a hefty fine attached. This is an example of the immoral method Escher is enacting. While shocked, she recognizes she is being played and agrees to go to a colony planet. \n\nSuzanne is the next woman-focused upon in the story. While admiring her apartment, she gets a call. Prompted by the call, she finishes getting dressed and leaves. She walks into a brownstone after being greeted by a young man. She is surprised and unhappy to see a group of women she recognizes sitting in a room. She sits down as instructed and the man addresses the room. The man presents a similar choice as the judge did to Ruby Johnson. When asked by the man, Suzanne tries to wittingly reply that she loves to travel, indicating she chooses to emigrate. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Karl Allen and Joseph Hill are working with parampa logs by heaving them up the river. They discuss how much time is left before they go to Landing City and register for a number on the list. They start talking about the possibilities with their future wives, including raising a family and taking care of a garden. None of them have ever met an Earthwoman, but there are many stories about the pretty women. Once in Landing City, they go to the rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office on Midplanet. Karl draws the number 53 and gets a few pamphlets with helpful information. He gets a sandwich and Pop from a boy before wandering back to the main field to wait for the rocket as it arrives. The story cuts to a conversation between Claude Escher and Mr. MacDonald. They discuss the growing ratio between women and men. Women are now turning to more petty crime because they believe it will help them catch a husband on Earth. They discuss more problems, especially how women do not want to colonize and men do not want to emigrate to the colonies. Once MacDonald leaves, Escher goes through the rules set up by the Board and tries to think of a better solution. The story then cuts to Phyllis Hansen, who goes to the washroom to clean up after a day at work. She then heads home and is worried about not finding a husband. There are alternatives to spending her evenings, such as bridge, gossiping, or a similar organization to fill the void. As she goes through the mail, Phyllis receives a poster advertising for women to go to the colonies to find a husband. She is offended and believes it is a violation of privacy. However, later, she writes a letter to the address on the poster. After, the story cuts to Ruby Johnson stealing a dress from a shop. She believes that the coast is clear but is caught by a detective. The male judge at the detention center asks why she stole it, but she refuses to tell him. Ruby gives out her statistics to the judge; he tells her that she can either go to the penitentiary for ten years and pay a ten thousand dollar fine or go to one of the colonies for a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus. Ruby agrees to be shipped out. The final woman is Suzanne Carstens, who rents her apartment by tricking her old landlady into believing she works as a buyer in one of the downtown stores. She receives a call and goes to the address promptly. Once she steps inside, she realizes that most of the women sitting in the chairs in the building are ones that she recognizes. Suzanne tries to explain herself, but even her name is fake. However, she is offered to be shipped out to the colonies for security or to face jail time. With no choice, she accepts the offer. \n",
        "Summary_4": "This story takes place in multiple facets of the same storyline. In the first part of the story, we meet Karl Allen and Joseph Hill, who are on one of the planets that have been colonised by Earth. They are waiting for the arrival of a shipment of women from Earth, who will become their future brides. There are more men in the colonies than there are women, and so the government has sent these shipments of women from Earth to marry these men. \nIn the second part of the story, Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Escher of the colonisation board try to come up with a plan on how to convince women to leave Earth, to go and live on these worlds that are just beginning to become civilised, and marry men they've never met. They eventually come up with the idea that the method they use to entrap these women into their plan does not have to be technically all that moral, and they may be able to cross a legal grey area. \nIn the third part of the story, Phyllis Hanson, a woman of Earth, returns home from work. She is in her thirties, and probably destined to be alone and unmarried for the rest of her life at this stage. That is until she receives a poster from an unknown source, with a picture of a strapping man, telling her to \"come to the colonies, the planets of romance\". She sends a letter to the address at the bottom of the poster. \nRuby Johnson is caught stealing a dress from a department store. At her criminal hearing, a judge sentences her to either ten years in prison, with a ten thousand dollar fine to work off, or a chance to go to the colonies, and get a five hundred dollar bonus. \nSuzanne Carstens leaves her gorgeous apartment one night to  meet a blind date (or a John) it seems. She goes to an address that looks like an office building, where a young man greets her. She is taken into a room where she is held, along with many other women. They are all given the same ultimatum as Ruby Johnson. \nTHE END."

        "Summary_1": "First, Joe takes some furs that could help cover the girl, and Joe hopes that she will appreciate it. However, Hill believes that they should give less to the girls. Because the less you give, the less they will expect, and if they are spoiled, the men has to do all the farming and family raising yourself, which is all that they have to do. Joe thought of the girl as somebody he can talk to, somebody that can help him with the farm. Hill suggests for his wife to have a garden, but Karl doesn\u2019t think she will have the time for a garden. However, it is important to note that the girls were considered as objects since Karl and Joe mentions trading them. In particular, Earthwomen are expected to be beautiful, sophisticated, glamorous, and hardworking. Moreover, Escher is thinking about persuading and forcing the girls to colonize while forgetting about the moral codes. The governments seems to expect the women without husbands to be satisfied with bridge games and benefits and lectures. ",
        "Summary_2": "The few women that were on the colonized planet where Karl and Joseph lived were expected to cook the food that was being served as part of the welcoming party for the wife draft. On Earth, the expectations for women are to find a husband. Phyliss is 30 years old and details her frustration with not being married at her age, complaining that nothing else can fill the emptiness that she feels from not having a husband. ",
        "Summary_3": "In the story, the women are expected to find husbands. This is especially apparent on Earth, where locking down a man has become an intense competition because of the five to three ratio between women and men. Furthermore, the Earthwomen are expected to be more sophisticated, cultured, prettier, and glamorous than the colonial women. These women are also expected to fulfill the traditional roles of raising families, helping colonize the planet, and supporting their husbands with whatever they need help with. The decision to send the women to the colonies is also made by men. On the other hand, women are expected to just follow along and accept the offer if they want any chance of landing a husband at all. \n",
        "Summary_4": "There are many expectations for women both on the colonised worlds, and on Earth. On Earth, women are expected to behave in a polite, civilised manner. They are also lucky to get a man of any kind, with women outnumbering men 5 to 3, so they are expected to take what they can get. Women on the colonised worlds are expected to obey their husbands, and take care of all tasks related to life on their farms. This includes: working the farms, and raising the families. \n"

        "Summary_2": "MacDonald notes that because of the higher population of women on Earth than men, a lot stricter laws have been enacted. An example includes a prohibition of alcohol from being used in everyday items such as cough medicines and hair tonics. In addition, there are laws against violating a women\u2019s privacy and a purity related moral code. An example of a privacy violation is when a woman asks Phyllis Hanson about her plans for the night. ",
        "Summary_3": "One of the odd things that happen in the story is the whole process of pairing up a husband and wife. The system is based on numbers as first impressions; although this seems to be an efficient way, Karl notices that there is almost no time for him and his future wife to get acquainted with one another. This is rather odd because many of them want to marry for love, yet the system caters to an arranged marriage rather than a natural relationship. Hill even brings up trading women if they are not satisfied with who they get.\n\nAnother odd occurrence in the story is how both men and women do not want to emigrate to the colonies. There are clearly more men in the colonies, yet many choose to stay on Earth because more women are there. None of the women want to go either; if they decide to leave Earth to colonize, it will be the same as giving up their luxurious, modern civilization to fight disease. \n",
        "Summary_4": "There are many odd things that happen in the story. The story itself is quite odd in form. It jumps from different times in one linear storyline, beginning at the end, and ending towards the beginning. It is also quite odd that the two men on the colonised planet think that women should be subservient, and that if you start to treat a woman with kindness and respect, and not as a servant, she will end up being spoiled. Another interesting part of the story is the nondescript place which Suzanne Carstens walks to. We are not really informed as to whether or not Ms Carstens is a prostitute, although it is insinuated. \n"

This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>\"You see?\"\n  \n \n  Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\nothers in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\ntheir own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n  \n \n  The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n  \n \n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n   \n   They\n   \n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n  \n \n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n  \n \n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n",

Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy.

He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  .

        "Summary_1": "They are meeting because currently, there are not as many females on the colonized planets. And this is a huge problem. From the beginning of the colonization, there were more adventuresome males than females, thus they headed for the new world but most of the females stayed behind. The disproportional rate in the genders that gone to colonies lead to five females for every three males on Earth, while the colonies have the opposite. Hence, those girls needs to be shipped from their original planet, in this case the Earth, to colony planets for those males there. However, not many girls are applying to go. Another problem, states MacDonald, is the number of men applying for emigration to colonized planets have been dropping. MacDonald considers this reasonable since it seems illogical for a male to move away from a place that has more females than males. Escher then disregards the qualification for colonization and decides to focus on making the people that don\u2019t want to colonize to colonize, whether it is through convincing or forcing. ",
        "Summary_2": "MacDonald and Escher meet because the Colonization Board has given MacDonald a blank check to get Escher to fix the gender ratio problem. The Colonization Board is worried about the effects that the gender ratio is having on Earth and the great psychological implications that it presents. They are concerned because it is also becoming more difficult to convince men to colonize planets because they do not want to leave Earth where they are easily favored by women due to their rarity. They have a greater advantage on Earth with their pick of women who cannot be easy picky with their choices. ",
        "Summary_3": "Escher and MacDonald meet to discuss the problems on Earth and how to encourage more people to immigrate to the colonies. They go over the concerning ratio between the two genders on Earth as a result of the colonization problem. Many of the men were initially eager to go into the stars, but the women did not follow as quickly. Many of the women are husbandless too, and men are refusing to emigrate to the colonies because there are so many women on Earth. Furthermore, the women who have grown husbandless have made the societies more puritanical than ever. The Colonization Board is looking for a solution to this problem, which leads MacDonald and Escher to meet. ",
        "Summary_4": "Escher and MacDonald meet to discuss how to get women to come to the newly colonised planets. When the planets were first colonised, more men than women went, as they had more sense of adventure, and women didn't want to leave the luxury of Earth to go live on a makeshift farm on a muddy planet. The men on these colonised planets need wives however, and they have been given the task of finding a way to get these women on Earth over to these new planets. They try to think of a solution, and come up with one that is in a very much legal, and moral grey area. They decide to give every woman who commits a petty crime a very serious ultimatum. They can either spend ten years in jail and pay a fine of ten thousand dollars, or they can go to these colonises and get a five hundred dollar bonus. "

        "Query": "What is the message that Captain Dylan delivers in SOLDIER BOY?",
        "Article": "Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and\npathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out\nin that miserable cold to meet him.\n  \n \n  The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not\ntoo clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than\nRossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n  \n \n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He\nwas about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the\nhovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man\nappeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.\n  \n \n  \"C'n I go now, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan turned and nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning,\nhe yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and\nput it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A\nmoment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.\n  \n \n  \"Was he\n   \n   drunk\n   \n  ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of\n   \n   liquor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the\nenvelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We\nhaven't much time.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As\nRossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but\ncould not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n  \n \n \n \n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his\nhands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and\nthen, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,\nthere was no time for that.\n  \n \n  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he\ndid not notice the wire.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with\nmore'n ten. Why?\"\n  \n \n  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.\n\"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take\nforty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"\n  \n \n  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no\niron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck\u2014she's all we\ncould afford.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that\nsomebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"\n  \n \n  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said\nquickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can.\nMaybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around\nhim and the scurrying people.\n  \n \n  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\"\nBecause the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but\nhe said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or\nanother, we won't leave anybody.\"\n  \n \n  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had\nhappened.\n  \n \n  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then\nburied it again and packed it down real nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.\n  \n \n  \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on\na live bomb like this, but I never....\"\n  \n \n  \"You think one of your people did it?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like\nmost government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n  \n \n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n  \n \n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n  \n \n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n  \n \n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n  \n \n  The soldier grinned.\n  \n \n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "An army ship lands near a settlement, and people look out their windows, grumbling about its presence because they want no contact with the army. A soldier disembarks and stands at attention facing the settlement, and the people assume he must be proud, ornery, or drunk. Eventually, a resident named Bob Rossel goes out to see what the soldier wants. The soldier identifies himself as Captain Dylan, explaining that he has a message from Fleet Headquarters for the person in charge. Rossel takes the envelope since they don\u2019t have anyone in charge. A young man inside the ship tosses Dylan a bottle, asks if he can leave, and tells him he\u2019ll be back that night. Rossel is appalled that the younger soldier appears drunk and throws Dylan a bottle of liquor. Dylan tells Rossel to read the message because they don\u2019t have much time and starts walking toward the settlement as the ship takes off.\n\tMan\u2019s first contact with aliens had occurred at the Lupus V Colony in 2360, which aliens destroyed. When the army came to investigate, it found 31 of the 70 colonists dead, with the rest, including women and children, missing. Buildings had burned, and all technical equipment was missing. The security bomb, one of which was planted in each colony to be detonated in such an emergency, had failed to go off\u2014the detonating wire had been dug up where it was buried 12 inches deep and cut. Because there had been 500 years of peace and people were conditioned to be anti-war, the army was small and lacked respect. So the army couldn\u2019t take the time to find out exactly what had happened but just spread the news to other colonies, most of which evacuated before they were attacked.\n\tThe message Dylan delivers is that the aliens are attacking again; this settlement needs to evacuate. A big gloomy man named Rush demands help from the army fleet, but Dylan informs him that the army is too weak to help. Dylan tells them that Lt. Bossio is warning Planet Three and returning that night to pick him up. Everyone must be gone by then. Dylan digs up the detonator wire and finds it has been cut. Rossel tells him their ship will only hold 60 of their 40 colonists and asks Dylan to take the rest on the army ship. Dylan offers to ask Bossio and then shows Rossel the cut wire. They discuss whether a colonist or an animal could have cut it. Dylan splices the wire as Rossel leaves.\n\tMeanwhile, an alien is hiding nearby, watching the humans prepare to leave. He presses a button that disables their ship. Rossel has been trying to reach Planet Three and can\u2019t get an answer; Dylan realizes the colony there is dead, so Bossio is, too. People strip their clothes to reduce their weight and take on more people. Forty-six are able to board. When the ship tries to lift off, it can\u2019t get off the ground.\n\t\n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Dylan arrives on this newly pioneered planet--only 100 years at that point--to tell the colonists there that they were in grave danger. After hundreds of years of peace and a practically obsolete army, an alien life form was attacking. He emerges from his small ship, flown by his best friend Lieutenant Bossio, and waits in the cold. Finally, Bob Rossel meets him and hears his message. Fleet Headquarters sent Captain Dylan to hand off the letter informing them that Lupus V had been massacred. In 2360, 31 of the 70 colonists died, while the rest were captured. All of their belongings were taken too, and that which remained was burned. After the army arrived, one soldier discovered that the detonator wire was cut. On each planet, there is a bomb placed in the center. So if any aliens were to attack, the colonists could detonate to prevent human secrets from escaping. Only this time, they couldn\u2019t, because the wire was cut. \nSince then, Captain Dylan had evacuated several cities and colonies. With his bottle of booze, Dylan informs the whole colony about the situation at hand and the need to evacuate. They protest at first and call him \u201csoldier boy,\u201d but after he tells them their sister colony, Planet Three, is also being evacuated, they run to pack their things. They are to leave by nightfall. Dylan digs into the ground in search of the detonator but finds the wire cleanly cut. Rossel returns to ask how many his ship can take, since their ship can only take 40, leaving 20 behind. Dylan knows that his ship can only take 10, so they decide to call Planet Three and ask if they have room. \nThey discuss the cut wire and who or what could have done it. Rossel leaves to ask if any of the colonists cut it and ask them to arm themselves in case of battle. After considering telepathy, Dylan leaves and walks out into the snowfall to try and contact Bossio who had yet to reply. A young woman asks him if he wants sentries posted on behalf of her father, and he follows her back to the group. Mr. Rush, her father, is a strong, wise man, and he tries to uncover who cut the wire. Although there is an animal on this planet, the viggle, it was already cleared. Eight sentries rushed out, and the Alien watched them from inside of the tree. Realizing that the humans knew they were in danger, the Alien changed his plans and disabled their ship. Planet Three was already under attack, so the Alien only had to wait till dusk to absorb.\nPlanet Three did not respond to Rossel\u2019s calls, he knew something was off. Dylan realizes he\u2019ll have to stay behind since Bossio was not coming back. The colonists strip and manage to squeeze an extra six people on the ship, thanks to the lessened weight. Rossel stays behind as well. However, the ship doesn\u2019t take off. \n",
        "Summary_3": "On a distant planet from Earth, Bob Rossel gets out of his warm bed on a cold night to greet a soldier (Captain Dylan) standing in a nearby field after landing his spaceship there. Captain Dylan was there to deliver a message from Fleet Headquarters to the person in charge of the colony of about 60 people, of which Bob claimed there was no one in charge so it might as well be him. The general consensus of the colonists is that peace must be achieved at all costs, and the Fleet army was counterproductive to achieving peace. So, it was quite a stir that a Fleet soldier would show up unexpectedly to deliver a message. The spaceship left with Lieutenant Bossio at the helm, promising to pick the Captain up later.\nThe Captain\u2019s message was that aliens had attacked another colony on Lupus V, killing about half of seventy colonists with the rest missing. All colonies were required to have bombs installed in a central building that would obliterate all the people there should aliens attack them to prevent aliens from gaining any knowledge of human technology or biology. At this colony, the wire from the detonator to the bomb was cut, inexplicably.\nThe Captain quickly hustles the colony on Bob\u2019s planet to evacuate, and they ready a ship that is capable of holding 40 people. It is somber for the 60 people there because not everyone will escape. Only the children, women, and youngest men are going to be loaded. Others in the colony begin pitching in and asking the Captain how to help, like Mr. Rush, who inquires about organizing sentries to post at their perimeter. During all of this, the Captain digs up the underground wire from the detonator to the bomb of this colony and finds it has also been cut very recently and reburied.\nThere is speculation as to who cut this wire, with the Captain thinking it must have been an alien and Bob thinking it must have been a colonist. There is an aside in the story, describing the culprit which is an alien hiding underground amongst the roots of a nearby tree and commanding the alien attack remotely. The alien moves up the attack from nightfall to dusk after seeing how quickly the colonists are mobilizing to escape. \nThe Captain is unable to check in with Lieutenant Bossio, who had gone to planet Three to evacuate the colonists there. It is already nightfall on planet Three, and the alien attack has most likely already killed Bossio. At the close of the story, the colonists have a tear-filled departure loading their ship. The Captain feels kinship with Bob, who is saying goodbye to his wife for the last time as she boards. The people aboard the ship leave their clothes behind to reduce weight - fitting 46 people on a ship that should have only held 40. As the ship doors close and it goes to take off, it is unable to move off the ground.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Jim Dylan arrives in an army ship at an unnamed colony in the midst of winter to warn the colonists of an impending attack by an alien species. Due to hundreds of years of anti-war conditioning, the army has had little to do and their resources have dwindled, so Dylan has spent the last thirty years of his life doing little else other than drinking, getting into trouble, and studying a little bit about military tactics. The colonists are not pleased with his arrival, and Dylan sends his fellow armyman Lieutenant Bossio to nearby Planet Three to begin the process of clearing their colony as well. A man named Rossel leads Dylan into town, where he relays the story of Lupus V and its decimation by alien attackers to a group of colonists. The aliens had killed half the population of Lupus V with a heat ray and the rest of the colonists had gone missing. Prior to the attack, a wire meant to detonate a bomb buried at the center of the colony in case of alien attack had been dug up and cut inexplicably. As a result, the army had been deployed to travel to each remaining colony to warn them. The colonists demand army protection, but Dylan informs them that the army fleet is too under-resourced and short-staffed to do anything other than warn of the attacks. As Dylan goes to investigate the state of the wire buried in this colony, he recalls joining the army back when people admired soldiers and how over time that admiration morphed into disgust because of anti-war conditioning. When he discovers the wire has also been cut, Dylan goes back to the radio shack. Rossel finds him there and they discuss how many people they can fit between the colonists' ship and the army ship. Because of insufficient space, they have to come up with a plan to fit the rest of the colonists. Meanwhile, Rossel asks about the cut wire, and he wonders if one of his people might have cut it out of spite for the government rules. Dylan wonders if it might be animals, or perhaps the aliens using telepathy. With Bossio still not answering his calls, Dylan meets with Rossel and a colonist named Rush, who provides Dylan with sentries and agrees with his theory that aliens are responsible for the cut wires. Meanwhile, an alien observes the action from a control center located underground; this is where he uses a box to schedule the attack on the village and disable the colonists' ship. When Planet Three doesn\u2019t answer, Dylan realizes Bossio must be dead. He returns to the radio shack alone, but an old woman brings him coffee and a mackinaw to keep him warm. This encourages him to go outside to help with the evacuation. When Dylan sees Rossel saying goodbye to his wife, he feels human connection again. Then he sees that the colonists' ship cannot fly."

Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,\nnobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier\nfinally stumbled on something.\n  \n \n  For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main\nbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be\nburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow\na whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn\nvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb\nat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The\ndetonating wire had been cut.\n  \n \n  In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of\nearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.\n  \n \n  The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five\nhundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,\nweak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread\nthe news, and Man began to fall back.\n  \n \n  In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won\nstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing.

        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on an unnamed planet some time after an alien attack in the year 2360. Colonists settled the planet and have built a village consisting of several houses and a radio shack. Presumably, this is where the colonists contact other colonies. It is also where the detonator for the security bomb is located, with the wire buried under 12 inches of dirt. The atmosphere is Earth-like. There are thick clouds overnight, and the morning is misty and cold. The breeze carries the smell of snow, and later in the day, the snow arrives. The planet is suitable for agriculture because the colonists have already harvested their warmer weather crops and planted their winter crops. The colonists have advanced technology because they have machines that plant and harvest and automatically run their factories. The temperature is below freezing, so people are staying in their houses and drinking coffee. A sister planet colony on Planet Three is much like this colony. The two colonies maintain contact via radios, and mailships make regular runs between the settlements on the different planets. Every settlement is equipped with a security bomb to be detonated in the event of an alien attack. The purpose of discharging the bomb is to prevent hostile aliens from learning important information about humans, including their technology and body chemistry.\n\nAnother setting mentioned in the story is the Lupus V colony attacked by aliens late in the year 2360. Lupus V had 70 registered colonists, including men, women, and children. It also had technical equipment, radios, guns, machines, and books. When the army arrived after the alien attack, everything had been taken, along with 39 women and children; 31 people died in the attack or the subsequent fire that the aliens set with their heat ray. The security bomb had not been detonated because the wire to it had been cut, even though it was buried 12 inches under the soil.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Soldier Boy by Michael Straaha takes place on a very cold and icy planet. Captain Dylan waited in the cold for a long time before Rossel arrived, forcing tears to his eyes. The colonists of this planet are reluctant to leave their beds and have especially thick and warm clothing designed for the cold. The planet was colonized less than a century ago by these pioneers. This process involves setting up plastic houses, sending machines out to the fields to plant crops and fertilize the soil, and factories to transform dirt into coffee. \nAs far as we know, there is only one other alien on this planet: the viggle. This creature is fairly similar to an Earth monkey. With four legs and a slightly mischievous personality, they mostly stay out of the way of the colonists. There are also lizards and trees, showcased by the fact that the Alien is living in the hollow of one. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Late in the year 2360, humans have expanded from Earth to colonizing other planets. The colonists are considered pioneers that inflate plastic houses on arrival that harden up. Then they release machines to plant and harvest, and use technology to transmute dirt into coffee (coffee being an important motif in the story for the comfort of home). \nThe unnamed planet that Captain Dylan lands on is in wintertime, bitterly cold, with snow falling often in the story and piling up high enough to cover footprints. The colonists stay inside for the winter, and so his arrival is startling as he stands in a cold field. Captain Dylan is invited into the homes of the colonists as they prepare to evacuate and also digs near the central bomb in the colony to find the cut wire that disabled the security system that would obliterate the colony upon alien attack to preserve human secrets. There is a small ridge around the colony that sentinels can be posted on.\nThe colonists have a \u201cseed of peace\u201d deeply planted in them and have been taught to hate war and despise soldiers. Because of this, there is little support for the army and their numbers have dwindled to the point where they can\u2019t fight off alien attacks. Ironically, the people in this colony are desperate for the Fleet to intervene to save them, but the Captain delivers the news that there is no Fleet to do so.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins at the start of winter following the planting of the winter crops as an icy breeze blows in, smelling of snow. There is a village where the colonists live and a nearby field where the army ship lands. Bushes, trees, and hills can be seen through the snow. Thick clouds gather in the north at night, and in the morning, it is misty and cold. The colony is home to sixty colonists, and they have a sister colony called Planet Three. They have one ship with one deck that can fit forty people and a radio shack used to communicate with other colonies, specifically Planet Three. The colonists sometimes kill a local animal called a viggle for being pesky; a viggle looks like a monkey with four legs. Every colony has been equipped with a bomb buried at the city center that can be triggered by detonation device with a wire attached to it. The alien that has cut this wire makes its control center in a wide, warm room under the base of a tree, where he lies wrapped in a thick, electric cocoon. He has a large box with several knobs with which he controls the timing of the assault on the village and disables the colonists' ship. He also has a chronometer he uses to check the time."

Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n  \n \n \n \n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his\nhands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and\nthen, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,\nthere was no time for that.\n  \n \n  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he\ndid not notice the wire.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with\nmore'n ten. Why?\"\n  \n \n  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.\n\"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take\nforty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"\n  \n \n  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no\niron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck\u2014she's all we\ncould afford.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that\nsomebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"\n  \n \n  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said\nquickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can.\nMaybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around\nhim and the scurrying people.\n  \n \n  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\"\nBecause the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but\nhe said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or\nanother, we won't leave anybody.\"\n  \n \n  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had\nhappened.\n  \n \n  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then\nburied it again and packed it down real nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.\n  \n \n  \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on\na live bomb like this, but I never....\"\n  \n \n  \"You think one of your people did it?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like\nmost government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n  \n \n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n  \n \n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n  \n \n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n  \n \n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n  \n \n  The soldier grinned.\n  \n \n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Captain Dylan is in the Fleet army and travels with Lieutenant Bossio to colonies on different planets with the message that an alien attack is imminent and the colonists must evacuate. He has become a drunk, which is not uncommon in the army because soldiers were outcasts. For the past three weeks, he and Bossio have been evacuating colonies\u2014the current one is their fifth and last. Prior to this mission, he has spent the last 30 years hanging around, getting drunk, and waiting for something to happen. He was made a captain just before this mission. Looking back, he finds it humorous that he used to study military tactics as if he would need to know them. After his father died of a hernia that he developed from working too long on a heavy planet, he joined the army. Dylan was lured by the army\u2019s recruiting advertisements calling itself guardians of the frontier. When he enlisted, anti-war conditioning wasn\u2019t as strong as it is now, so people weren\u2019t as resentful and disrespectful of soldiers then. Dylan feels that along the way, after all the time he spent in bars and jails, he lost his core. He also believes it doesn\u2019t matter whether he makes it back home: he has no connections and doesn\u2019t owe anybody anything. Drinking has become a way of life, and while he digs for the wire to the bomb, he takes a drink, but after he finds the wire has been cut, he reaches for his bottle but for the first time in a long time, stops before taking a drink. \nWhen the colonists start looking to him for help and answers, Dylan is somewhat pleased because now they are showing him respect, but he is annoyed, too, since it is only because they are scared and need help. When Dylan learns that Planet Three hasn\u2019t answered any radio calls, he connects that to the fact he hasn\u2019t been able to reach Bossio and concludes that the colonists and Bossio are dead. He knows this means he will have to stay behind on the planet when the colonists leave, but that doesn\u2019t bother him. What does bother him is that Bossio is dead only because they had come to help these people\u2014people who wanted nothing to do with them until their lives were threatened. Bossio was his best friend, and Dylan mourns his loss. Even though Dylan resents the people for their disregard for him and the army, he has sympathy for them. He doesn\u2019t want to watch their pain when the women have to leave their men behind, and he is touched when an old woman offers him coffee and a mackinaw to help him stay warm. As he watches Rossel and other men saying goodbye to their wives and children, Dylan begins losing the shell the last 30 years had created around him and begins to feel that these people are his people.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Dylan is a member of the Earth\u2019s army, presumably reporting back to Fleet Headquarters. His father died of a hernia when he was only 19 years old after years of hard work and grueling labor. This sudden absence left Dylan feeling alone in the world, so he happily signed on when the army came to town, speaking of frontiers to discover and great adventures to be had. However, with an anti-war sentiment spreading across the colonies, there was no real army to join. Their fleets were small and fairly untrained or, at least ill-prepared for war. When Captain Dylan finally got word of an alien attack, he feared that the anti-war thinking would hinder their ability to fight back. \nHe arrives on this cold planet to inform the colonists that they need to evacuate. Since Lupus V, he\u2019s been to several cities and colonies over a few weeks and evacuated them all. Lietenant Bossio, his best friend, dropped him off before flying to Planet Three to evacuate the colony there too. He is dependent on alcohol both for warmth and to get him through. He is met with contempt and hostility, but he perseveres and convinces them of the danger. \nHe drinks to fight off the cold and digs beneath the ground to check the bomb. He discovers that the wire has been cut, like on Lupus V. He ponders telepathy, but is interrupted by Rossel who reveals that they don\u2019t have enough room on their ship for all 60 inhabitants. \nDylan is a little cranky, but tries his best to problemsolve. Slowly they reach a compromise and Dylan buzzes Bossio to see when he\u2019s coming back from Planet Three. He doesn\u2019t hear back. Dylan eventually realizes that Bossio is not coming back, so he will be stuck on this planet while the aliens attack. \nThe story ends with Dylan watching as 46 members of the colony squeeze onto the spaceship, while he resigns himself to his doom. The rocket doesn\u2019t start, and all are left behind. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Dylan spent 30 years in the West end of space on the \u201couter edges of Mankind\u201d doing patrols as a peacetime officer before finally being made a Captain. He has never fired a gun. He developed a habit of drinking alcohol, and often in the story drinks from a bottle on his hip to cope with hard news.\nHe and his Lieutenant, Bossio, were summoned out of a bar with the news of the alien attack on Lupus V and charged with clearing the colonies in danger. They cleared four colonies in three weeks, and this planet was due to be the last. \nAfter landing on the planet, he is initially met with some skepticism by the colonists, who then quickly shift into high gear to follow his instructions to evacuate. He goes about digging up the wire to the safety detonation system in the colony to check it is functioning, but it has recently been cut. He thinks it was an alien, and he turns out to be right. There is a nearby alien hiding under a tree orchestrating the attack that is never discovered by the humans.\nThe Captain sees through helping the colonists to load their ship with 46 people to escape, but on take off it is not able to lift off the ground.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Jim Dylan is a tall, frail-looking army man with pale blue eyes whose appearance is not too neat. He salutes Rossel sloppily when they first meet and delivers an envelope with a message from Fleet Headquarters. After delivering the message, his ship leaves, and Rossel accompanies Dylan back to the village. When Dylan was 19, his father died of a hernia, and he joined the army; those were the days prior to the anti-war conditioning, and people viewed soldiers as \"guardians of the frontier.\" In the ensuing years of boozing, being imprisoned, receiving anti-army insults, and endlessly waiting for something to happen, Dylan had lost the thrill of action and had lost touch with himself. Prior to his deployment with Bossio to clear the colonies, the army had finally made him a captain; even that achievement feels empty to him. Dylan has mostly been drinking for the past thirty years thanks to the army's inaction and the fact that they were universally disrespected and hated by most colonists. However, he had also spent some of that time studying military tactics. Still, he realizes he has never fired a gun. Dylan halfheartedly engages with the colonists when he first arrives to warn them of the impending alien attack. But he slowly warms up to them as he realizes that they actually need his help, and he can offer them that help. He theorizes that the cut wire is the result of telepathic interference by the aliens as they preempt their attack. He works with Rossel to devise an evacuation plan, and Rush provides Dylan with sentries. Dylan is devastated when he learns of Bossio's death. Bossio had been his only friend. In spite of the fact that Bossio had died for people who hated him, Dylan finds he cannot hate the colonists. They simply don't understand that no conflict leads to decay. At the same time, he realizes he cannot truly help them either, so he retreats back to the radio shack.  After an old woman brings him a mackinaw and coffee, Dylan realizes he should help after all. When he sees people removing their clothes to allow more people on board, and he witnesses Rossel tearily saying goodbye to his wife, Dylan feels a human connection he had lost in those thirty years of aimlessness."

Late in the year 2360\u2014the exact date remains unknown\u2014an alien\nforce attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and\nthe dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the\narmy.\n  \n \n  When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists,\nthirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children,\nwere missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,\neven books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were\nthe bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,\nnobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier\nfinally stumbled on something.\n  \n \n  For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main\nbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be\nburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow\na whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn\nvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb\nat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The\ndetonating wire had been cut.\n  \n \n  In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of\nearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.\n  \n \n  The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five\nhundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,\nweak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread\nthe news, and Man began to fall back.\n  \n \n  In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won\nstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of\nthe colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died\nin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those\nships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a\nsociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only\ndefense Earth had.\n  \n \n  This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth\nwith a bottle on his hip.\n  \n<doc-sep>When it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low,\nobviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the\noutpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the\nblazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over\nExtrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled\ninto the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its\nblasts.\n  \n \n  Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat\ndisgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.\n  \n \n  Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking\nofficers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce,\nthe officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and\nknees almost stiff.\n  \n \n  \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked.\n  \n \n  They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone\ndemanded, ominously not raising his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it's another alien ship.

        "Summary_1": "The army has no respect from the colonists; they don\u2019t want anything to do with it because they associate it with war. The people at this time have been conditioned to despise war and anything to do with it. When they see Captain Dylan standing by his ship and facing the village, they think he is ridiculous or possibly drunk. Rossel noticed that Dylan appeared like a typical soldier: not very neat and not very clean, and his salute lacked proper military precision. And when Lt. Bossio tosses Dylan a bottle of liquor, Rossel isn\u2019t surprised because of the reputation soldiers have for being drunks; in fact, Rossel is disgusted by the liquor and Bossio\u2019s drunkenness. When aliens attacked Lupus V in 2360, the army found the destruction and dead and discovered why their security bomb hadn\u2019t detonated. There was little the army could do about the alien attack because the army had become so small and weak. There had been peace for 500 years when people didn\u2019t need the army, so its equipment was old, and many of the soldiers were from the bottom of society: drinkers and gamblers. So the army is just notifying other colonies of the attack and warning them to evacuate. When the colonists learn that they have to evacuate due to the threat of an alien attack, Rossel demands that the fleet defend them, and another man named Rush asks where the army fleet is, expecting it to come to their defense. When Dylan explains there is no fleet, just a few hundred obsolete ships, he is tempted to tell them that no one wants an army until it is needed. Dylan himself has been in the army for 30 years and has never seen any action. And when Rossel realizes the colony\u2019s ship won\u2019t hold all of the colonists, he asks if any fleet ships are within radio distance that they could summon to help with their evacuation, hoping that the army is near enough to be of help. Ironically, the army that they despise now offers their only hope.  ",
        "Summary_2": "After 500 years of peace, few saw the reason for maintaing or keeping an army intact. With anti-war and peace sentiments running abound, those that served were looked down upon, since they were paying for their seemingly worthless service. However, when the aliens attack, suddenly the long-forgotten fleets were called into action, and the drunken soldiers were called to arms. After the years of inactivity and depleted funding, the army is not what it once was and is having trouble containing the alien threat. \nThe army is both the saviour and ultimate enemy in this story, as they could offer protection, but simply don\u2019t have the means to do so. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The army is significantly smaller than it once was due to humans having a loathing of war and thus, reducing the size of the Fleet over time. Humans have had 500 years of peace and anti-war conditioning, that have led to the army becoming \u201csmall, weak and without respect.\u201d The army could do nothing but warn colonists of attack.\nIronically, the colonists question Captain Dylan why the Fleet isn\u2019t coming to their rescue, to which he describes the Fleet barely exists and now only has a \u201cfew hundred half-shot old tubs that were obsolete before you were born.\u201d In this way, the army is significant in the story because it is not wanted by many, but it comes to be called on for help anyways in their time of need.\nCaptain Dylan has worked for thirty years as a peacetime soldier and thinks to himself that peace-loving nations in the history of Earth never stay strong, but does not go on to labor the point to the colonists. He feels deeply sad that his only friend, Bossio, was already dead from trying to help these people that didn\u2019t support the army, and that he too would soon have the same fate. Captain Dylan shakes off this mentality and in the end feels that he can\u2019t hate the colonists for wanting peace because it is a noble thing for trying to achieve.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The people of the village have been taught over the years to hate war, and as a result, they also hate soldiers. They suspect every soldier they meet is a drunk, which Captain Dylan appears to confirm when he catches a bottle tossed to him by an associate upon first arriving at the village. Later, Dylan recalls the thirty years of his army career, which has largely been spent drinking and getting into trouble. Due to hundreds of years of anti-war conditioning, the army is under-resourced, understaffed, and underfunded. In fact, there are only a few hundred ships left that are mostly obsolete and a handful of army leadership and government jobs available. However, when the aliens attack, the army deploys Dylan and Bossio to help warn and evacuate as many colonies as possible, which they do to little fanfare. In fact, Bossio dies in the effort, and it appears that Dylan might as well."

Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold.

The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was\nsilent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,\n\"Maybe an animal?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or\nfound it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think?\nThe wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one\nis cut too\u2014newly cut.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.\n  \n \n  \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that\na bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that\nsomething didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the\ncenter of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then\nwalked right out again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\"\n  \n \n  He started away but Dylan caught his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them.\nI'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\"\n  \n \n  Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his\nhands.\n  \n \n  He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that\nhe'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was\nperhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.\n  \n \n  All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How?\nTelepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?\n  \n \n  No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there\nwould be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really\nknow.\n  \n \n  Were they small? Little animals?\n  \n \n  Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable\nbrain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large\nas a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long\nbefore a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly\nshown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.\n  \n \n  He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.\n  \n \n  He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he\nstraightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out\nhis pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last\ntime he had fired it.

He had to keep that trembling\nbody of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.\n  \n \n  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog\nthinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last\nhundred feet to sanctuary.\n  \n \n  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within\nthe tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and\nslept for several hours.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When the army investigates the destruction of Lupus V, it discovers that the wire to the bomb that would blow up the community had been cut. The wire was hidden 12 inches under the ground, so it would not have been easy to find. Since the wire was cut, the bomb didn\u2019t explode, enabling the aliens to take the women and children, along with all the technology, from the planet. The purpose of the bomb was to prevent the aliens from gaining knowledge of human technology and body chemistry; presumably, aliens would be able to use this information against humans in the future. Because Dylan knows of the cut wire on Lupus V, he checks the wire for the bomb on the planet he has come to evacuate. When he discovers the wire is cut here, too, he notes that the ends are clean, so someone made the cut recently. The ground over the wire was packed down, so whoever cut it also wanted to hide that it had been tampered with. Rossel assumes one of the colonists must have cut the wire, possibly thinking it was dangerous for the colonists and just a silly government rule. After Dylan tells him about the wire being cut on Lupus V, Rossel plans to question everyone. Dylan wonders if the aliens could have cut it by telepathy of one of the colonists but rules that out because if they could control one human, they could control all of them. Dylan then wonders if an alien has done it. No one knows what the aliens look like, but for them to have intelligence, they would need a large brain, making the alien about the size of a large dog. Dylan knows all the animals on the planet had been vetted before the colony was settled. When he tells the others his suspicion, Rush says the only animal they\u2019ve seen nearby is a viggle, which is something like a monkey with four legs. The viggle passed Biology\u2019s screening, so the viggle is ruled out. Although Dylan doesn\u2019t discover the alien hidden in its electric cocoon, he is convinced that aliens cut the wire. He is also convinced that the alien attack is imminent.\n",
        "Summary_2": "After the 70 colonists on Lupus V were either captured or killed, the soldiers discovered a cut wire leading to the detonator. The bombs were placed to protect human secrets, chemistry, and biology from prying alien hands. The fact that someone or something knew about the bomb and knew how to preven it from detonating suggests that the aliens are more intelligent about human life than everyone previously thought. \nWhen Captain Dylan finds the cut wire on the ice-cold colony, he realizes that they need to evacuate as quickly as possible, since this is the sign that the aliens are already here. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The wire being discussed is one which connects a detonator to a bomb mandated to be a the center of each human colony for security purposes. The bomb is intended to destroy the entire colony and all the people in it upon alien attach so that the aliens don\u2019t learn about human technology and body chemistry.\nThe bomb on Lupus V, the first colony to be attacked, did not blow because the wire had been cut. Thus, the alien attack captured many of the humans there, potentially giving them access to their technology and biology that humans had been trying to keep secure. Similarly, the wire had been cut on the planet that Captain Dylan landed on to evacuate in the story, which he discovered by digging down to it almost a foot underground. The reader learns there is an alien hiding underground nearby controlling the attack that may have been capable of cutting the wire through something like telepathy. The significance that two wires were cut in the same way suggests that the aliens are mounting a concerted attack on many human colonies and disabling their detonators in order to gain advantages over humans by learning their secrets.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Each colony had a bomb buried in the center, which would be detonated in the event of an alien attack in order to prevent them from learning important facts about human technology and body chemistry. When the aliens attacked and destroyed Lupus V in 2360, the army investigated the remnants of the colony there; they discovered the wire that was hidden under a foot of earth and was intended to trigger the detonation had been dug up and cut, thereby preventing detonation. Dylan discovers a similar situation when he arrives at the unnamed colony of the story. When he finds the cut wire, Rossel believes it is one of the colonists lashing out against a government they do not respect. When Rush sees the wire, he agrees with Dylan that it must be some kind of telepathic alien intervention. In fact, an alien had cut the wire, presumably by deploying a box that allowed it to perform actions remotely from a subterranean control center. The cut wire provides the warning the colonists need in order to have time to evacuate before the alien attack."

        "Summary_1": "Jeff Elliott and his wife Ann meet a peculiar stranger, Mr. Snader, at a restaurant in the year 1957 as they are discussing Jeff\u2019s desire to go 5 years into the past to buy a building for $2000 that would\u2019ve changed his luck entirely. The stranger had been listening to their conversation and was seeking someone with Jeff\u2019s credentials (color television engineer) to complete an illegal job he\u2019d been hired for. Jeff and Ann have no idea that Mr. Snader is on such a job, but entertain his quirky conversation.\n\nMr. Snader has a friendly and persuasive personality, narrowly convincing Jeff and Ann to follow him to his time travel station and take a free trip to see if they like it. The Elliots do not perceive the situation as dangerous, and continue choosing to trust him at each step. Ultimately, the Elliots are escorted six years back in time through a time travelling process that appears like stepping through a screen, but their past is nothing like they remember. It is a different place entirely, and though they are frightened, their excitement and perhaps also their complete reliance on Mr. Snader to get them back home, causes them to keep following him even though he has become mean with them. \n\nMr. Snader takes the Elliotts to an apartment house to meet Septo Kersey and Dumont Bullen, the general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine. It\u2019s revealed that Mr. Snader tricked the Elliots, and brought them to Mr. Bullen who had illegally sought Jeff\u2019s services as a color engineer to profit his own interests by creating color television that did not yet exist in their time. Jeff was furious, and totally helpless.\n\nJeff and Ann were allowed to leave, because their captors were certain that they could not actually escape them. They had no idea how to leave this timeline, and had no way of finding justice being illegally present with no work permits. When Jeff and Ann stop for lunch and try to pay with the money in their pockets (which appears as illegal tender), they are approached by an officer and find out they are in a place called Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Everyone in the interaction is deeply confused, because time travel is not understood to be possible by the public - Jeff and Ann look crazy. Both are escorted to separate jail cells in a prison.\n\nOne of Mr. Bullen's barmen, a lawyer, was sent to arrange Jeff\u2019s release, if he was willing to cooperate and go work for Mr. Bullen. The lawyer has to explain to Jeff the concept of time travelling before he can get any cooperation, and so says that time travel is entering a different dimension, not moving along a linear timeline. Things look so different to Jeff in the past because he didn\u2019t travel back a linear path to exactly the way things were when he experienced these things six years ago. The story ends during their discussion.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The year is 1957. Jeff and Ann sit at a restaurant and discuss Jeff\u2019s business troubles. He is concerned that he made a bad business choice five years ago. Ann tries to reassure him that that he has plenty of time to make it all back again. Greet Snader, a foreign man with a mustache, sits nearby, and overhears their conversation. He asks if they would like to go back in time. Jeff tries to leave, but Ann insists that they listen to what he has to say. Snader hands them his card and offers them a free trial. He calls Jeff Mr. Elliot although Jeff has not given the stranger his name. This gives Jeff the slightest sense of hesitation, but Ann is eager to go with Snader.\n\nAnn and Jeff follow Snader to the station, which turns out to be a reasonably-sized home in a residential neighborhood. Inside, there are two screens hanging from the ceiling. One is labeled \u201cAnte\u201d while the other is labeled \u201cPost.\u201d Each screen shows a movie, and when Snader salutes the people that appear on one screen, the strangers wave back. Ann and Jeff are both shocked because the entire thing seems impossible. Ann and Jeff watch Snader step into one of the screens, and when they look at the other screen, he steps out. \n \nSnader tells them they are going back six years. They step into a screen and jump out a few moments later. When they walk through the same door they entered, the surroundings are different, and Jeff\u2019s car has been replaced by a limousine. Snader drives, and they do not recognize anything around them. Snader stops the car outside of a building and tells them to follow him inside. \n\nAnn and Jeff meet Mr. Bullen. He explains that he is the general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, and he needs Jeff, someone from the future, to make sure that he gets colored television before anyone else. Jeff refuses to work for him, but Bullen says that Jeff is there illegally without a permit or a file. Jeff and Ann call his bluff and leave, but Bullen reminds them to call Butterfly 9 if they get in trouble. The couple goes to a restaurant, and when Jeff tries to pay, the cashier says it\u2019s counterfeit. They find out that they\u2019re in a country called Continental Federation, and these people have never heard of the U.S. Jeff and Ann are taken to jail. One of Mr. Bullen\u2019s henchmen shows up to talk to Jeff, and he explains that Jeff and Ann went back in time six years, but time isn\u2019t like a movie. Events don\u2019t stay consistent in the past because dimensions change. Technically, Snader didn\u2019t lie, but he manipulated Jeff into believing that time traveling is something that it\u2019s not. \n",
        "Summary_3": "\n\tJeff and Ann Elliott are having dinner in a restaurant after Jeff has learned he\u2019ll need to start his business over again after his building is sold. They are approached by a man at the next table who has been watching and listening to them and who offers them a chance to get away. At first, they think he means a trip, but he is referring to time travel. Jeff says he wishes he could go back five years and buy the building. The man offers them time travel for free and gives Jeff his business card, identifying him as Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent for the 4-D Travel Beuro. Snader invites them to come with him and indicates they can be back in one hour. Jeff and Ann ask many questions but ultimately decide to go with Snader to see what he is about.\nHe takes them to his station, a mid-sized home in a middle-class neighborhood, and shows them a room labeled 701 with two screens, indicating that they are showing people who are time traveling right now in the fourth dimension. He waves at some of them, and they wave back at him. Snader demonstrates how the screens work, walking into one and then exiting from the other. Jeff wants to try this, and he and Ann enter. Snader says they will exit at Station 725 which is six years in the past. When they exit the screen, they are in another house; Snader escorts them to a limousine outside, explaining to Jeff that his car isn\u2019t there because it\u2019s in the future. Jeff and Ann notice that the street seems somehow different than it did when they arrived. \nSnader drives them across town, using a freeway where Jeff knows there was only a boulevard in the past. He accuses Snader of taking them to the future rather than the past, but Snader doesn\u2019t respond. He pulls up in front of an apartment building and tells Jeff that he\u2019ll learn everything upstairs when Jeff demands answers before getting out of the car. In a luxurious apartment, they are introduced to Septo Kersey, who congratulates Snader for bringing Jeff and then takes the couple to meet Mr. Bullen. Bullen confirms that Jeff understands radioptics and chromatics and then tells him that he will develop these features for his company. Angered, Jeff tells Bullen he won\u2019t be told who he works for and that he and Ann are leaving. Bullen allows them to go but warns that they will be in serious legal trouble since they have no immigrate permit or citizen file. \nJeff and Ann walk to a restaurant at a nearby shopping center to eat, and all the food on the menu is unfamiliar. They eat a meal, but when Jeff tries to pay with his money, the clerk calls the police over because his money is no good. Jeff and Ann are locked in jail overnight until Bullen\u2019s lawyer comes the next day to get them out.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Over dinner, Ann tells her husband Jeff (a TV color specialist) that he will be able to make a comeback after his building's lease has expired. Snader, a man at the next table who had been listening, suggested that they go back in time to get a better deal on the sale. Jeff dismisses him but the man joins them at their table, explaining that he\u2019s from a different time and offering them a free trial time-travel trip at the \u201c4-D Travel Beuro\u201d, Ann asks for more details: Snader invites people who want change, but he knows more about Jeff than expected. Despite these concerns, his wife agrees to give time travel a try. They head to an average home in a good neighborhood that serves as Snader\u2019s office, where they meet Peter Powers, a bureau agent. They enter a room labeled \"701\" with two large screens with moving pictures; the people on these screens are explained to be time travelers in the fourth dimension. This time groove can reach as early as 600AD, with convicts from Snader's time working to build the groove further back. Snader walked into one of the screens, and Jeff and Ann saw him in the other screen shortly after. Jeff is convinced this is a visual trick and wants to be shown how it works, and hesitantly steps into one of the screens. Snader leads them six years prior but tells them they can\u2019t ask any more questions, and they get out at station 725, a room that looks identical to the one they left from. Nothing else is the same: Powers is gone, and the street outside looks different; Snader insists it\u2019s because they have traveled through time. Ann is over her fear and feels excited, figuring that they were in the future instead of the past because of a freeway they did not recognize, but Snader doesn\u2019t confirm anything. They explore and eventually meet an older man named Septo Kersey, who has asked for Snader to retrieve Jeff to work for him, as a sort of informant in color television technology. Kersey and Bullen (another man who works for the company) threaten the couple, saying they were illegal immigrants in this particular time stream. Jeff and Ann insist on leaving, and are given instructions of how to return if they get into trouble. It\u2019s now Ann who\u2019s concerned, and Jeff tries to calm her as they look for food. After they eat, they learn that their money isn\u2019t recognized in this society; they are in the Continental Federation, not the United States, even though their languages are mutually intelligible. Jeff is convinced he\u2019s so far in the future that the US has been forgotten, the police think he\u2019s trying to fool them. One of Bullen\u2019s lawyers was there for them when they woke up, and tried to explain that time is a dimension, not a series of events, so that nobody would have experienced the same history that Jeff had.

Taking advantage of Park's loss of\nspeed, I raced alongside.\n  \n \n  The I. V. manager lifted his weapon frantically. But before he could\nuse it a third time, Ezra Karn had whipped a lariat from his belt and\nsent it coiling across the intervening space.\n  \n \n  The thong yanked tight about the manager's throat. Park did the only\nthing he could do. He shut off power, and the two cars coasted to a\nhalt. Then I was across in the other seat, wrenching the weapon free\nfrom his grasp.\n  \n \n  \"What have you done with Miss Flowers?\" I demanded.\n  \n \n  The manager's eyes glittered with fear as he saw my finger tense on the\ntrigger. Weakly he lifted an arm and pointed to the northwest.\n  \n \n  \"Val-ley. Thir-ty miles. Entrance hidden by wall of ... flagpole trees.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Florence, Italy\n   \n  September 10\n  \n \n  Dear Joe:\n  \n \n  This telepathic control becomes more difficult every time.

Six of my hotel rooms were\nfilled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\n  \n \n  I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I\nrealized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction\nthat inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there\nimmediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not\naware of the nature of my activities.\n  \n \n  I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I\nstuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered\ninto the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager\nI was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best\ncustomer.\n  \n \n  \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\n  \n \n  I was baffled. What could I tell him?\n  \n \n  \"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're\u2014they're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They're what?\" he wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \"They're not safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\"\n  \n \n  At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!\"\n  \n \n  He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.\nAnother day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning to think like\nthe not-men, curse them.\n  \n \n  Glmpauszn\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story takes place on Earth, in the year 1957. It opens in a restaurant, and quickly transitions to Mr. Snader\u2019s 4-D TRAVEL BEURO time travel station, inside of a \u201cmiddle-sized, middle-cost home in a good neighborhood.\u201d They could hear traffic dimly in the station and see mountains out the windows on the horizon.  \n\nThe time travelling room appears like a doctor's waiting room, with chair lined walls. There is a station sign - 701 - that hangs on the ceiling and two movie screens on the far ends of the room. Stepping through one screen would take them forwards in time, and one backwards in time. The Elliotts go to station 725, which Mr. Snader tells them is six years in the past.\n\nThe past is very unfamiliar, more industrialized with more highways than they remember. After travelling in a limousine, they transition to a 6th floor apartment house of a building with heavy carpets and soft lighting.\nThe final settings are a lunch counter, with unfamiliar food to the Elliotts, and finally their jail cells.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Ann and Jeff meet Greet Snader in a restaurant where they are having dinner and discussing Jeff\u2019s business troubles. After meeting Snader, they follow him to a place called a \u201cstation.\u201d They are surprised to find that it\u2019s actually a moderately-sized home in a residential neighborhood. It doesn\u2019t look suspicious at all. Jeff notes the mountains on the horizon and the warm breeze he feels before he steps inside. Snader uses a key hanging from his necklace to unlock the door, and once inside, he leads the couple to an area that looks a lot like a doctor\u2019s waiting room. However, there are two screens hanging from the ceiling, and they are both playing moving pictures. There is a large plaque that says \u201c701\u201d, and Jeff and Ann do not know what to make of it. They are even more dumbfounded when Snader salutes some of the people on screen, and they wave back at him. \n\nAfter Jeff and Ann time travel, they exit the screen and find that the room looks very similar to the one they were just in. For a moment, they believe that Snader has tricked them. However, when they leave the building, they find a limousine out front instead of Jeff\u2019s car. They drive through the city they call home, but none of the signs and landmarks are even remotely the same. \n\nAfter leaving Mr. Bullen\u2019s office, they walk around town a little bit and quickly realize that the language on all the signage is different from how they speak. One reads, \u201c'Sleek neck-sashes, only a Dick and a dollop!\u201d Ann also notes that the women dress strangely, and it\u2019s unlike anything she\u2019s ever seen before. After noticing that all of the food at the restaurant looks slightly different than what they\u2019re used to, they learn that they are actually in the town of Costa, in the state of West Goodland, in the country of Continental Federation. The language they are speaking is called Federal, and the cash they are using appears to be counterfeit. Although Jeff and Ann believed they would be returning to the exact same world they knew six years ago when Ann\u2019s father was alive and he lived with them, they were misled by Snader. The couple was actually taken to a different dimension where events have unfolded in completely different ways.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The first setting is 1957 in a small, crowded, noisy, and hot restaurant. Jeff and Ann are having dinner, and Snader\u2019s table is near enough that he can overhear the couple talking. This enables him to join their conversation and eventually lure them into time travel.\nSnader takes the Elliotts to the second setting, the station where he begins their time travel. The station is located in a mid-sized house in a middle-class neighborhood. Lights are glowing in the windows as they arrive, and outside they can hear the traffic on the boulevard a few blocks away. It is dusk, the weather is warm, and Jeff can see the mountains on the horizon. Snader unlocks the door, and they are greeted by a man at a desk in the hallway who sends them to another room. \nThis room is the station. A sign with the number 701 hangs from the middle of the ceiling, and there are two big screens like movies screens hanging on one wall, showing movement through a corridor with rows of seats like a railroad car. There are easy chairs along the walls, making it look like a doctor\u2019s office waiting room. \nWhen they enter the screen, they are in the chair-lined corridor. Snader tells the Elliotts to sit, and they face a screen like the one in the room they had just left. The image on the screen makes it look as if they are racing through a dark tunnel toward a light at the far end. As they approach the light, they see a room like 701, but this one is 702. They exit at room 725 by stepping through the screen.\nStation 725 looks much like 701, but when they leave the room, there is a motherly old lady outside. Snader tells them they aren\u2019t there for lodging, and they leave the house. Outside, Jeff notices his car is missing. Snader tells him it\u2019s in the future. The street outside the house has different trees and houses than he remembered in the neighborhood with the 701 station. Telephone poles and streetlights also seem different. As the limousine pulls away from the curb, Jeff makes it a point to remember the street name, Green Thru-Way, and the block number, 800. Ann notices bars on the windows of the house. The limo heads onto a freeway where the boulevard should be, but the mountains are the same as always. Signs are unfamiliar and have strange wording like Rite Channel for Creepers and Yaw for Torrey Rushway.\nSnader takes the Elliotts to an apartment building near a shopping center with bright lights and lots of shoppers, neither of which are familiar. Snader escorts them inside the apartment building, riding the elevator to the sixth floor and traversing a heavily carpeted hallway with soft gold lights. Later they eat at a restaurant with unfamiliar food names and monetary units; their check is for 1/20. Finally, the Elliotts are imprisoned in a jail with smelly cells.\n\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story starts in a restaurant, but quickly moves to a house that is known as the 4-D Travel Beuro. This is a fairly typical, mid-range house of average size in a good neighborhood, which keeps it from sticking out in any way because nobody would be suspicious of it. Inside the house there are a number of ornate rooms locked behind closed doors, guarded by a bureau agent known as Peter Powers. Behind one of these doors is the room that serves as station 701 on this particular time groove, that has two large screens that show moving images of people who seem to be aware of the people standing in the room. People can easily step into these rooms and find themselves traveling on a time groove, and this is how Jeff and Ann travel to the time Snader is from. Once they have traveled through time, they expect to see the same suburban neighborhood but much of the context has changed: a different highway, different cars, and different houses. The people in this time use different currency and have different vocabulary than the people Jeff and Ann are used to. After some time in lockup, Jeff and Ann also encounter an apartment building. On the sixth floor of this building, they meet the man who hired Snader to find Jeff. There is an ornate drawing room where Jeff and Ann have a meeting with Septo Kersey and a man named Bullen who are hoping they can use Jeff's expertise to move ahead of the technological developments of their own time. Refusing to help, Jeff and Ann leave and are eventually captured for not having legal money, and the story ends with them in a holding cell at a local police station."

He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Time travel is suggested as a way to solve troubles. To fix regrets. Ironically, it is not this at all, because the way time travel works is not linear. Thus, it\u2019s not possible to go back to an exact moment in your past and make a different decision.\n\nJeff is very impatient about the time they are spending with Mr. Snader, but continues to be roped into one thing and the next by convincing himself that they are in no real danger. There is a kind of tension between Jeff feeling like he is wasting time, but then allowing time to run on as their involvement with Mr. Snader deepens further and further until they lose 6 years of time completely.\n",
        "Summary_2": "At the beginning of the story, Jeff is worried that he has lost so much time on his failed business. Ann tries to convince him that he\u2019s still plenty young, and he has many years to make back whatever he lost. Snader hears their conversation and butts in. Ann and Jeff don\u2019t realize that he has already had his sights on them specifically because Jeff has been ordered by Mr. Bullen to improve his business. Bullen wants to make colored television before anyone else can, and in order to do that he needs someone from the future to give him the secrets. \n\nSnader makes Jeff and Ann believe they are going on an adventure to visit the past that they knew only six years ago, but he lies to them. They do not understand that the past does not work like a movie. When you travel to the past, the events change. This is because time is a dimension, and it is not linear. One of Bullen\u2019s henchmen explains to Jeff that if he went back to 1865, there would no longer be a Civil War, and no one would know who Abraham Lincoln is. Landmarks, like the mountains outside of the station, will not change, but events will. ",
        "Summary_3": "Time is significant in the story because it is the basis for Jeff\u2019s unhappiness and the couple\u2019s reception of Snader\u2019s travel offer. The reality of time as a dimension is why Jeff doesn\u2019t recognize the past when he and Ann travel back. Jeff wishes he could go back in time five years and buy the building where he has been working for $2,000. It has just sold for $12,000, and now he has to leave and start his business over again. Snader\u2019s offer of time travel appeals to Jeff and Ann because Jeff believes he\u2019ll be able to buy the building. Snader\u2019s assurance that they can be back in an hour helps persuade the couple to go with him to the nearby station. When they go into the screen to travel through time and Snader drives them along a freeway that didn\u2019t exist in the present 1957 or five years earlier, Jeff is convinced that Snader has actually taken them to the future. Kersey tells them that they have traveled six years back in time before the development of chromatics (color television). Bullen wants Jeff to develop color television for his company, Continental Radioptic Combine, so that he will be first on the market with color TVs. When Jeff and Ann eat at the restaurant, and Jeff tries to pay with two one-dollar bills, the clerk calls the bills \u201cstage money\u201d and motions for a policeman to come to them. The officer looks at the bills and wonders aloud what the United States of America is and tells Jeff he is in Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. None of this makes sense to Jeff and Ann, and when Jeff is interrogated at the police station, the questions seems stupid to him. When Bullen\u2019s lawyer arrives to get Jeff and Ann out of jail, he explains to Jeff that he did travel six years in the past but that time is a dimension rather than a stream of events. He indicates that if Jeff went back to 1865, the people there would know nothing of Lincoln or the Civil War. Therefore, Jeff\u2019s idea that he could buy the building is incorrect because different events will be happening in 1952. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Time plays a few roles in this story. One is the motivation for Jeff and Ann to be interested in the time-travel technology in the first place: if Jeff could travel back in time a few years, he could sign a lease for a building for a much cheaper price that the going rate in his own time. Snader takes advantage of this fact to slip himself into the conversation the couple is having and offer his services in time travel, the particular mechanics of which are another major role of time in this story. Snader offers a time travel service that works with a technology too complicated for him to be able to explain, but for which we see two screens in one room that have moving images on them. These screens show people passing through the timestream and work as stations along a moving path of time, kind of like a train line. Once the group travels on this \"time groove\", they notice a number of differences in the \"new\" time, the past that Snader comes from. In fact, because of the differences, even though Ann and Jeff are in the past, they think that they must be far in the future because of how different things are. One of these is the construction of a highway that was not there during their time, and the other is that nobody has heard of the United States of America. Jeff figures that nobody has heard of where he comes from because they have moved so far forward in time, when it is really because in this version of the past, the United States did not develop in the way it did in Jeff's time. Because time affects the way language develops, it is interesting that one of the major differences between the time Jeff and Ann live in compared to the time Snader is from is the way people talk. In the past (that is, Snader's time), there are a lot of phrases and nouns that do not match the same words that Jeff and Ann have for those same concepts. The word for lawyer, for instance, differs. However, the languages have enough in common for the people from the different times to communicate with one another. The story ends with a discussion of how this time travel works, to show how differently the various people think about time. "

How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n  \n \n  \"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black.

        "Summary_1": "Jeff and Ann Elliott are a married couple. Ann is supportive of Jeff, and assures him that with their youth he will be able to rebuild his failed business. She reassures him throughout the story, even at points where it ultimately leads them into deeper trouble - such as when she tells him it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try Mr. Snader\u2019s time travel. \n\nJeff is protective of Ann on several occasions, like at the start of the story suggesting he would start a brawl at the restaurant if the stranger was interested in Ann\u2019s beauty. He is also upset enough with his business struggles that he needs to take sleeping pills, of which Ann is concerned about the amount.\n\nThey remain together in the story until they are held in separate jail cells. They do not have any major disagreements in the story, and seem to enjoy their time together, only hoping to improve their lot by trying a risky time travel adventure.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Jeff and Ann have a loving and supportive relationship. When Jeff is feeling down on himself, Ann reminds him that he\u2019s great at his job and that he has plenty of time to bounce back. She worries about the number of pills he\u2019s taking, and she insists that he stop worrying about losing his lease. She is genuinely concerned for his mental health and his overall well-being. The couple can easily joke around with one another. When Ann suggests that Snader might be following them, she makes light of the situation by suggesting that it\u2019s because he\u2019s attracted to her. Jeff, in turn, offers to physically assault him if he tries anything. After meeting Mr. Snader, both Jeff and Ann have a good time playing along with the scenario they never imagined themselves being a part of. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of prodding on Ann\u2019s part to make Jeff go to the station with her and Snader. They both have a devil-may-care attitude that makes this adventure worth checking out. \n\nLater, when they find themselves in a heap of trouble and end up in separate jail cells, Jeff can only think of Ann. He worries about her being all alone for the night. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Jeff and Ann are like many married couples; when one is down or frightened, the other tries to build him up or assure him that all will be fine. They switch between these roles with each other easily, suggesting that they have been married a good while. Ann is supportive of Jeff\u2019s career and his skills, assuring him that he will be able to start over and be successful again. She also teases him and makes humorous comments to lighten his mood. When they disagree with each other, it isn\u2019t antagonistic. When Jeff wants to leave but Ann wants to hear what Snader has to say, she simply puts her hand on Jeff\u2019s arm and says she hasn\u2019t finished eating and would like to hear what Snader has to say. Jeff and Ann also play off of each other. When Ann jumps up to see what Snader wants to show them, Jeff\u2019s pulse picks up as he entertains the idea, too. They make decisions together; when Jeff is undecided about going into the apartment building, he looks to Ann to see her reaction. When she says they might as well go inside and see what is there, Jeff agrees and goes along with her. They make a good team: Bullen\u2019s comment that Jeff is going to make his company be the first to produce chromatics, Jeff\u2019s takes affront at the man\u2019s boldness, and Ann is likewise disturbed.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Jeff and Ann react differently to most things, but in a way where they are able to balance each other out. For instance, when they meet Snader at the beginning of the story, Jeff is frustrated with the interruption to his dinner and does not want to hear more about what he thinks is bogus, but Ann is curious and wants to hear Snader out, to be entertained if nothing else. Ann is very supportive of Jeff and the story starts with her trying to console him about the recent failure of his business venture as a lease on a building he was using had ended. While reassuring him, she reminds him that he is excellent at what he does and have no trouble starting up again, but Jeff is feeling very grumpy and sad about the entire situation. Jeff is very cautious, and is concerned when he hears Snader use his last name, because he had never given the man his name. Ann is more on the curious side, willing to give anything a try, including a method of time travel she only knew about from a stranger she encountered at a restaurant. She does get a little bit nervous once she has actually stepped inside the device, but the fear dissipates once she is outside again in a whole new world. Although Jeff starts the story upset, he remains mostly calm throughout the story and even when he is hesitant he does not become overwhelmed with fear at his situation. He and Ann both have to encounter some issues with their money not working, and sorting out what to make of their situation, but they support each other and keep each other calm throughout the story.

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between the Elliotts and Mr. Snader in Butterfly 9, and how does it change throughout the story?",
        "Article": "A tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n  \n \n  \"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n  \n \n  \"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\n  \n \n  The old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\n  \n \n  He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\n  \n \n  Snader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\n  \n \n  Bullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\n  \n \n  The blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\n  \n \n  Kersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n  \n \n  \"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff nodded. \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  The old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n  \n \n  \"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n   \n   Ante\n   \n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n   \n   Post\n   \n  .\n  \n \n \n \n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n  \n \n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n  \n \n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n  \n \n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n  \n \n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n  \n \n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n  \n \n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n  \n \n  \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are? Look around.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n  \n \n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n  \n \n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n  \n \n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n  \n \n  Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n  \n \n  Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n  \n \n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n  \n \n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n  \n \n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n  \n \n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n  \n \n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n  \n \n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n  \n \n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n  \n \n  Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n  \n \n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n  \n \n  The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n  \n \n  She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n  \n \n  Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Initially, the Elliotts find Mr. Snader to be peculiar with his mustache, facial scar, traces of a broken nose, and accented speech. Jeff is not interested in engaging with him, but Ann continues to deepen their conversation with him at the restaurant thinking that Mr. Snader is insane and she will humor his ideas.\n\nMr. Snader shows hints of being forceful to the Elliots throughout the story. His persuasiveness to come to his time travel station is forceful at times, he takes their arms to escort them into the future portal (as if he wants to ensure their compliance), and once they are roaming the city in the future Mr. Snader largely drops the act and stops being nice to the Elliots altogether (ignoring their requests for him to drive safely, and being curt with them to get them into his drop off spot with Mr. Bullen).\n\nThe Elliots are captivated by the silliness of Mr. Snader\u2019s story at first, believing it is a magic trick right up until they travel into the past, and then seem largely blinded by their curiosity and excitement to think critically about how much danger they are really in. They acknowledge Mr. Snader is being deceitful at times, like when Jeff asks for his questions to be answered, but become so reliant on Mr. Snader\u2019s support to get them back home that they remain with him. When Mr. Snader\u2019s plan is revealed - that he has delivered the Eliotts into the past to be forced into labor to create a color television company - they feel betrayed by Mr. Snader.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The Elliots are initially wary of Snader. They look at him before he approaches them in the restaurant, and Ann tells her husband that she thinks she saw him outside in the parking lot. She wonders aloud if he has been following them. When he first starts up a conversation with them, Jeff immediately wants to leave, and it\u2019s Ann who gets a kick out of the improbable dialogue they have. She wants to learn more about his insane-sounding ideas about time travel, although she doesn\u2019t necessarily believe anything he\u2019s saying at first. Both Jeff and Ann laugh at the card that Snader hands them because nearly every word is misspelled and to them he appears unprofessional. \n\nThey do not spend very much time with Snader, but they appear to trust him quite readily. They are skeptical about his promises and insist that it\u2019s probably all fake, but they don\u2019t associate the dishonesty with Snader personally. When Snader physically shows them how time traveling works by stepping in and out of the screens, Jeff and Ann are so excited that they actually link arms with the stranger. Moments later, Jeff calls him \u201cbrother\u201d. Jeff initially insists that they take his car to go to the station, but when it disappears outside after they have time traveled, they have no problem getting into the backseat of a limousine and allowing Snader to drive them. When he brings them to a building they have never seen before, they wonder what could possibly be dangerous about it instead of insisting that they remain vigilant. Snader delivers Jeff and Ann right to the bad guys, and they never see it coming. Bullen\u2019s guys thank Snader and mention the payment he will receive as a result of bringing them their victim, Jeff. Had Jeff and Ann refused to trust a stranger with a wild story about time traveling, they would not be stuck in another dimension. \n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The Elliotts are always somewhat suspicious of Mr. Snader, but they are intrigued by his claims and offer of time travel and curious enough to want to find out more about it. Snader uses Ann to draw the couple\u2019s initial interest; she is more open to listening to him than Jeff is. Jeff is somewhat antagonistic to Snader, for example, commenting on the misspelled words on his business card and sometimes speaking to him derisively. Likewise, Snader mocks Jeff with his eyes. Ann is more open to Snader\u2019s offer, asking him questions to learn more about it and commenting she wishes time travel could be true. Her receptiveness ignites Jeff\u2019s desire to escape his worries for a while so that he is willing to learn more from Snader. When Snader takes them to the station, Ann expresses concerns to Jeff, but he believes they won\u2019t be in danger. However, when Snader shows Jeff the screens and waves to people on them who wave back, the Elliotts are more convinced that what Snader offers is real. Snader is his nicest to Jeff just before they enter the time travel screen, but the closer they get to the apartment building, the less interested he is in answering questions and being polite. He orders them into the limousine and at one point issues a warning: \u201cTonight, you look where you are going.\u201d Ann notices the station house has bars on it, and Jeff is suspicious enough that he makes a point of remembering the street names where the station is located so they will be able to find it again on their own. His tentative trust of Snader continues eroding when he realizes they are on a freeway that didn\u2019t exist yet in the present. When he asks Snader if he\u2019s brought them to the future instead of the past, Snader doesn\u2019t even bother to answer. At the apartment, Jeff and Ann learn that Snader was paid to bring them there, and he \u201cmockingly\u201d waves at them as he leaves now that his job is done.\n\n\n",
        "Summary_4": "The relationship between the Elliotts and Mr. Snader is one with varying levels of distrust and suspicion but also some curiosity and genuine interest. When they all meet, Jeff is suspicious of everything that Mr. Snader says and does not thing it is worth his time to listen to Snader talk. Ann is curious, though, and wants to hear Snader out. It is not clear from this first part of the story what Snader thinks of the Elliots besides his interest in them as people who might be able to benefit from what he has to offer, at least on the surface. Once they all arrive at the \"4-D Travel Beuro\", as Ann has agreed to give Snader's time travel a try, the suspicion is continued. Because Jeff is an expert in color television, he is convinced everything he is seeing is some kind of visual trick and he wants to learn how it works. Jeff lets this color his interactions with Snader, and most of what he says to him has some audible distrust. At this point, Ann is also worried, once they step into the moving picture, but her fear dissipates once they are outside of the house in a different time. During this time travel, Jeff and Ann have had a lot of questions for Snader, but he is not answering any of them, at least not directly--this adds to the mistrust felt by the Elliotts. Once Snader drops the Elliots off with Kersey, they are understandably upset when they realize they have been tricked."

Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Roberts shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n  \n \n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n  \n \n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n   \n   you\n   \n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n   \n   the pipes!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n  \n \n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n  \n \n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n   \n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Roberts moaned.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n  \n \n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n  \n \n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n  \n \n  \"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n  \n \n  \"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Stop talking!\n   \n  \" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\n   \n   Blow!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\n  \n \n \n \n   Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\n   \n \n \n \n  He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Haa-a-roong!\n   \n  \" blew Isobar Jones.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  And\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\n  \n \n  As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\n  \n \n  So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n  \n \n  \"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\n   \n   like\n   \n  it! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\n  \n \n  And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\n   \n   piobaireachd\n   \n  into\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\n   \n   can\n   \n  hear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\n  \n \n  Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it; the Grannies\n   \n   liked\n   \n  this music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\n  \n \n  Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\n   \n   dared\n   \n  not\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\n   \n   Rhoderik Dhu\n   \n  and the lilting\n   \n   Lassies\nO'Skye\n   \n  , the mournful\n   \n   Coghiegh nha Shie\n   \n  whose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\n  \n \n \n   The Cock o' the North\n   \n  , he played, and\n   \n   Mironton\n   \n  ...\n   \n   Wee Flow'r o'\nDee\n   \n  and\n   \n   MacArthur's March\n   \n  ...\n   \n   La Cucuracha\n   \n  and\u2014\n  \n \n  And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n  \n \n  \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\n  \n \n  And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\n  \n \n  He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\n  \n \n  Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n  \n \n  \"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\n   \n   those Grannies are\nstone dead\n   \n  !\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Isobar Jones\u2019 first call of the day was from Dome Commander Colonel Eagon telling him to deliver his weather reports to Riley Sparks, the Terra contact, ASAP. He works diligently but is soon called again, this time by Eagon\u2019s niece who wants to know about the weather in a certain sector. Shyly, he answers then quickly finished his work. Sparks calls him and asks him to bring his reports to him, as well as informing him that Roberts and Browns were sent Outside for repair work. Sparks makes fun of Isobar\u2019s bagpipes. \nIn Sparks\u2019 office, Isobar delivers his work then waits for him to make the call. Once he\u2019s delivered the report, Sparks asks the Earthman to turn his microphone around. As he does so, the video changes from his face to that of Earth, beautiful trees, and green grass. Isobar is grateful to Sparks and tells him so. They talk about Isobar\u2019s homesickness until Colonel Eagon walks in to hear them discussing the Outisde. He quickly shuts it down and informs Isobar that it is now forbidden for him to play his bagpipe, due to the horrendous noise. Beyond frustrated, Isobar runs back to his rooms, grabs his bagpipes, and sneaks his way Outside by tricking the patrolman. Once he\u2019s breathing in the thin air, he calms down and makes his way two miles out from the gate. Suddenly, he hears the sound of a gun and is brought back to reality. Roberts and Brown rush into view, both injured but grateful to see him, thinking he answered their distress call. However, he didn\u2019t bring an armored tank with him, only a pair of bagpipes. A dozen Granniebacks run behind them, so Isobar helps Roberts and Brown climb a tree to escape. \nThe Grannies are unable to climb trees due to their significant size, but they can tear it down. As they pull and heave on the trunk, Isobar has the idea to play his bagpipes so the Dome will hear it and come looking for them. Roberts thinks it\u2019s a good idea, so he begins to play, and slowly the Grannies all relax and lay down on the ground. They\u2019re all amazed, but when Isobar stops playing, one of the Grannies starts to move again. He plays his entire repertoire and more before the armored tank arrives. The men from the dome reveal that the Grannies are dead, and the sound of the bagpipes must be what killed them. Isobar saved the team. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Horatio \"Isobar\" Jones lives and works in the Experimental Dome at Lunar III, a frontier outpost functioning as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point, and meteorological base on Luna, Earth's moon. As a meteorologist forecasting weather for Earth, Isobar owes daily weather reports to Dome Commander Colonel Eagan, whose niece he also advises on forecasts for her personal travels. Isobar receives a call from his associate \"Sparks\" Riley, who manages communications with Earth in the Dome's transmission turret. Isobar tells \"Sparks\" he is about to bring him the report, and \"Sparks\" implores him to leave behind his bagpipe, the only item that brings Isobar any joy in the Dome. He also informs Isobar that the maintenance men Roberts and Brown have gone Outside to make foundation repairs to the Dome. Isobar gets jealous when he hears this, and when \"Sparks\" makes his call to Earth, Isobar asks him to request the Earth radioman to twist his mike so he can get a glimpse of Earth's nature that he misses so much. When Commander Eagan enters the room, he informs Isobar that he must stop playing his bagpipe, as the sounds travel through the air-conditioning system and disturb the other workers. Indignant, Isobar says he will go Outside the Dome, which is forbidden due to the existence of the Granitebacks, called \"Grannies\"--a fast-moving native species with impenetrable, protective carapaces known to kill humans. Eagan doubles down on his commands, and an angry Isobar returns to his quarters. In his absence, \"Sparks\" converses with Dr. Loesch, who diagnoses Isobar with \"weltschmertz\"--a deep world-weariness that makes the sufferer resort to radical acts in order to feel happiness. At the same time, Isobar takes his bagpipes, tricks the Junior Patrolman attending to the impervite gates, and goes outside to feel the sunlight on his face, breathe fresh air, and play his bagpipes in peace. Outside, Isobar walks several miles away from the entrance to the Dome, where he stumbles upon Roberts and Brown, who are injured and running away from a hostile group of Grannies. Because no weapons can pierce the thick carapaces of the Grannies, the men scurry up a nearby tree adjacent to \"Sparks'\" transmission turret. When the Grannies begin attacking the tree, the men believe they will die; however, Isobar decides to play his bagpipes, hoping the music will alert \"Sparks\" to their dilemma by way of the air-conditioning vent. As Isobar plays, the men notice the Grannies seem to be entranced by the music. Isobar continues to play until help arrives, and they all realize the music has actually killed the Grannies.",
        "Summary_3": "Horatio Jones, known as Isobar, is ready to report the weather to the Dome Commander, Colonel Eagen. Isobar is stationed on the moon at Lunar III.  His job involves reporting the weather forecasts for Earth. When he signed up to be part of the Frontier Service, he expected an exciting adventure, but his life for the last six months has been boring. Isobar especially hates the stale air that he must breathe every day. \n\nWhen Isobar\u2019s coworker Riley makes contact with Earth\u2019s radioman, Isobar hangs around and begs him to ask the operator for a glimpse of Earth. He obliges. The grass, birds, and flowers make Isobar even more homesick. Riley says that there\u2019s plenty of foliage to look at outside on the moon, but Isobar complains that he isn\u2019t allowed to venture Outside. It\u2019s too dangerous to leave the station because the Granitebacks, also known as Grannies, are ready to attack at any moment. In fact, Brown and Roberts are currently risking their lives to make repairs to the building. The Grannies are creatures that appear to be made of rock. They are not very intelligent, but they have exoskeletons harder than diamonds, and their speed allows them to take down humans in a matter of seconds.\n\nIsobar\u2019s only pleasure is playing his bagpipe, and he has been informed that all instruments are banned. Isobar offers to go Outside to play his bagpipes, but he\u2019s reminded that no one is allowed to leave the station unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\n\nRiley sees Isobar is angry,, and he gets a kick out of it. On the other hand, Dr. Loesch, an older physicist, feels sorry for Isobar. He argues that Isobar is suffering from weltschmertz, or weariness of the world. Some men with the condition commit suicide while others rebel in unforeseen ways. He\u2019s right because Isobar is lying to the guard so that he can go Outside and play his bagpipes.\n\nIsobar feels the warm air, and he is instantly happy. A short time later, he hears a pistol go off, and he sees Roberts and Brown. They believe he has received their calls for help, but that isn\u2019t the case. The men are being chased by a dozen Grannies, and Isobar instructs them to climb up a tree. The group of Grannies begin to hurl their bodies at the tree like a battering ram. The three men believe they are about to die. Isobar decides to play his bagpipes to get his colleagues\u2019 attention. As soon as the music begins, the Grannies stop attacking. Although the men believe the Grannies are deaf, they appear to be laying down on the ground, unmoving, to listen. Eventually, an armored tank comes to rescue the men, and Isobar passes out from playing the pipes so fervently. The Grannies, it turns out, were killed by the music\n",
        "Summary_4": "Horatio Jones (also called Isobar or Jonesy) is a meteorological forecaster at the Experimental Dome on Luna stationed within a hemispheric dome called Lunar III. He had spent six months there and would not get to go home for at least another six. It was a desolate place that only served as a rocket refueling station, transmission center, and meteorological base.\nIsobar is crunching the data to write a new weather report to be delivered to his colleagues Sparks and Riley to transmit to the station on Earth. After delivering the report, he lingers in the transmission tower, desperately wanting to get a peek at Earth during the video transmission of his work to Earth. The receiving person on Earth complies and turns the video feed around the room so that they get a view out of the window to the outdoors on Earth with green grass and people enjoying the day. \nIsobar reveals he longs to experience the flowers and trees again to his colleagues. There is a place that this can be done on Luna, in another adjacent hemispheric dome called \u201cOutside\u201d that contains a lush valley, but this is strictly forbidden other than absolute necessities for things like repairs due to extremely dangerous beasts called Granitebacks (Grannies). Dome Commander Eagan overhears Isobar\u2019s admissions, becoming serious about how under no circumstances is he to go Outside or to play the bagpipes because the sound transmits to everyone through the air conditioning system. Seeing an opportunity for himself, Horatio suggests he go Outside to play his beloved bagpipes, citing that two of his colleagues (Brown and Roberts) are also Outside conducting orders. The Commander is steadfast in his decision and strictly forbids Isobar from going outside.\nHoratio returns to his room and immediately takes the bagpipes and goes Outside by convincing the patrol guard there were orders for him to take his post while he reports to general headquarters. He is enthralled by the lush life in the hemisphere, and wanders a great distance from the gates until he is underneath of Sparks\u2019 radio turret and hears the loud firing of a Haemholtz ray pistol. Brown and Roberts are being attacked by a group of Grannies, and have radioed the Dome for help with no response. Isobar is helpless to assist other than suggesting they all climb a tree. To their luck, the Grannies can\u2019t climb, but they start ramming the tree until it is obvious that they will all die up there soon once they knock it over and devour them. \nIsobar starts playing the bagpipes to alert the attention of Sparks in the tower above them. He is successful in getting the attention of Sparks who comes with a tank to rescue them, but even more amazingly the bagpipe music has killed all the of the Grannies at the base of the tree. Isobar saves the day with the bagpipe music everyone in the Dome hates.\n"

        "Summary_1": "The bagpipes are Isobar\u2019s one relief and a reminder of home. Isobar Jones hates his new job and position on Luna III and plays the bagpipes as a form of therapy. When they are taken away from him, he quickly revolts and rushes Outside to play once more. \nThough the bagpipes are initially only significant to Isobar, they quickly become the savior of the whole story. After Roberts and Brown run into Isobar, followed by Grannies, they climb a tree and hope for the best. Isobar plays the bagpipes as a way to alert those in the dome that they are outside, seeing as the air conditioning valve was near. However, as it turns out, the Grannies are able to hear, and the sound of the bagpipes slowly but surely killed them. The bagpipes saved Isobar\u2019s life in multiple ways, as well as that of Roberts and Brown. They also proved to be a scientific breakthrough, as they are the only thing to ever kill a Grannie. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The bagpipes are Isobar's most cherished possession. Six months into his one-year term at Lunar III, Isobar begins to experience extreme homesickness, and he begins to loathe the artificial air-conditioning of the Experimental Dome as well as the rule against going Outside because of the threat of the \"Grannies.\" To keep himself sane, Isobar plays the bagpipes. However, the loud sound disturbs the other workers in the organization, and soon Commander Eagan orders Isobar to cease playing the bagpipes for the rest of his term. This causes Isobar to rebel, and he leaves the Dome against orders to play his bagpipes in peace. Once Outside, Isobar discovers Roberts and Brown are under attack by a group of Grannies, and he plays his bagpipes to try to alert \"Sparks\" that they are cornered up a tree. As a result of Isobar's music, the men discover the sound of the bagpipes not only calms the Grannies, but it also eventually kills them. Therefore, Isobar's insistence on playing the bagpipes leads to the discovery of a solid defense against the humans' primary threat on Luna.",
        "Summary_3": "Isobar is miserable while stationed at the Lunar III, and playing his bagpipes is the only pastime he has that he truly enjoys. He has been part of the Frontier Service for six months, and he regrets leaving Earth and the beautiful landscape to sit in a bubble day after day and breathe recycled air. His colleagues hate his music, and it\u2019s difficult to stop the sounds from emanating all over the station because of the air conditioning vents. When he refuses to stop playing on multiple occasions, his Dome Commander institutes General Order 17, which is a ban on all musical instruments. Isobar does not take this news very well. He can\u2019t suppress his anger at this news after being disappointed and depressed for a long stretch of time. Isobar argues that he should be able to go Outside and play, but of course that\u2019s off-limits. The Grannies would almost surely attack him, and he\u2019s forbidden from leaving unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Isobar decides to ignore the rules because playing the bagpipes is what truly makes him happy. He tells the guard that\u2019s working at the door to the Outside that he\u2019s been sent to take his place. Instead of watching for Roberts and Brown, however, he slips outside with his pipes. After he sees his colleagues being attacked by the Grannies, he completely forgets about his instrument, but it\u2019s a good thing that Roberts asks him about it, because the bagpipes actually save the trio\u2019s lives. Isobar decides to play his instrument to alert his coworkers about the trouble he and Roberts and Brown are in, but by the time help arrives, they no longer need it. The Grannies are killed by the music, the one thing that all the humans hated with a passion. ",
        "Summary_4": "Isobar loves to play the bagpipes, but is discouraged by his colleagues, like when Sparks tells him not to bring them with the forecast he is delivering to him because of his sensitive eardrums. Doodlesack is the word his colleagues Riley and Sparks call the bagpipes to tease him. Later in the story, the Dome Commander Eagan actually cites a new rule he has made that practising musical instruments must be discontinued immediately by dome staff because the sound travels through the air conditioning system and annoys people. \nAfter Isobar smuggles the bagpipes Outside to play them and gets swept up in an near-death attack by the Grannies with Brown and Roberts that has them stuck up a tree waiting to die, his colleagues continue to tease him by saying they can\u2019t even die in peace since he'll be playing the bagpipes.\nAlthough Isobar\u2019s intention was to get help to come rescue them by playing the bagpipes and alerting Sparks in the nearby control tower to their danger with their loud sound, the story ends in an amazing twist instead. The bagpipe music is the only thing known to be capable of killing the Grannies. All the Grannies at the base of the tree layed down and died when the music was played, and Isobar\u2019s hated musical instrument saves the day.\nMore than this, the Grannies are a barrier to humans being able to advance their colony on Luna, so Isobar\u2019s discovery that the bagpipes are lethal might be an important key for progress.\n"

        "Summary_1": "Granitebacks are huge creatures that live on Luna III. Their immense size, hulking form, and impenetrable body make them practically indestructible. As of the beginning of this story, no Grannie had ever been killed. It was also believed that they were unable to hear, lacking ear canals, and potentially intelligence. Their exoskeleton or carapace was impenetrable, even harder than diamond or steel. Each weapon the Earthman devised to use against the Grannies failed. However, at the end of the story, it\u2019s revealed that Grannies can, in fact, hear and are deeply affected by the sounds of the bagpipe. Isobar\u2019s playing kills them all within 10 minutes and allows him and his companions to escape safe and sound. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Granitebacks, colloquially referred to as the \"Grannies\", are the only mobile form of life found on Luna, and were named by the first explorers of the moon. Although the Grannies have low intelligence, they are a deadly threat to humans. They move fast for their size and weight, and their bodies are covered with impervious exoskeletons impenetrable even by humans' most sophisticated technologies. Isobar does not fear them because they haven't been seen around the Dome in quite a long time. However, when Roberts and Brown run afoul of a hostile group of them during a routine maintenance run Outside, they take shelter with Isobar up a tree, knowing that none of their weapons can defend against the Grannies. The Grannies attack as a group, throwing their hard bodies against the tree, which bends and dents upon impact. When Isobar plays his bagpipes, the men learn that Grannies can be lulled and ultimately killed by the sounds emitted from that instrument. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Grannies, also known as Granitebacks, are mobile creatures that live on the moon, and they are highly dangerous to humans. The people working at Lunar III are not allowed to venture Outside because the Grannies will attack with little notice or reason. They are described as rocks on legs, which is where their moniker came from. The Grannies are not highly intelligent creatures, but intelligence isn\u2019t necessary when they have exoskeletons made of incredibly strong material that can\u2019t be wounded by steel or fire. Their exteriors are stronger than diamonds, steel, or any other known material to humans. Due to their immense weight, the Grannies cannot climb trees, so Isobar\u2019s plan to climb to avoid them is a great move. However, the creatures work in packs, and about a dozen of them begin hurling their bodies at the tree at the same time, and this breaks the tree\u2019s trunk. The men believe that the Grannies are deaf, but that turns out to be incorrect information. So far, the humans have not found a single weapon that works to fight against the Grannies.  Isobar\u2019s discovery that the music he creates with the bagpipes actually kills the Grannies is literally lifesaving. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Granitebacks (Grannies) are deadly beasts of low intelligence - the only life form found on Luna - so named because they are indestructibly impervious to human weapons. Their biology is a mystery to science because one has never been killed so it can be studied in a laboratory. All that is known is that their outer shell is harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate. \nOne weakness of the Grannies is that they are unable to climb, which is how Isobar, Roberts and Brown escape their land attack by climbing a tree in the Outside dome. However, the Grannies are exceptionally strong, capable of uprooting a tree large enough to hold three adult men. Ultimately, the thing that kills Grannies is bagpipe music, which causes them to lay down and die.\n"

However, it is inhabited by Granitebacks, an unbeatable foe known to kill any Earthmen who dare cross their path. So, the new inhabitants of Luna III built a giant dome to keep themselves safe from the Grannies, at least until they devised a way to beat them. The dome allows its residents to see out but makes it very difficult for them to escape. The inhabitants are there to provide Earth with news from space as well as other meteorological forecasts. The dome has air-conditioning and thick glass walls, so there\u2019s no fresh air or real sunlight, only the meager, filtered kind. ",

Since the first Lunar expedition, humans have established Lunar III, a frontier outpost that operates as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point, and meteorological base. Resting in a lunar valley rich with grass, flowers, insects, sunlight, trees, and fresh air, the outpost is comprised of several domes, including the Experimental Dome from which Isobar Jones observes and reports weather on Earth. The Dome has a transmission turret, operated by Sparks Riley, which allows communication with Earth, and the atmosphere of the entire outpost is controlled with atmo-conditioning units reoxygenating the air. Isobar plays his bagpipes locked inside his office, but everyone in the Dome can hear him thanks to the air-conditioning system that can't be shut off. To prevent people from leaving and to protect against the Granitebacks, massive impervite gates protect the entrance to the Dome.

Working as a meteorologist for Earth and radio operator, he spends his days locked in the Experimental Dome of Luna meant to protect them from the Grannies, the indestructible creatures in the Outside. His only relief comes from playing his bagpipes, but his weariness, homesickness, and blues were catching up to him. \nAfter sending out his forecasts to Earth, Isobar reveals his deep desire to escape the dome and venture Outside. Caught by Colonel Eagon, he is punished by a new commandment stating that no musical instrument can be played as it disturbs the rest of the dome. An ardent player of the bagpipes, he is heartily disappointed and upset by the news. His weariness or weltschmertz as Dr. Loesch called it makes Isobar take his bagpipes Outside the dome so he can play in peace. He tricks the junior station manning the door and slips out once he\u2019s out of sight. After walking for a long time through the beautiful scenery, he hears the sound of a gun firing. Knowing what this means, fear quickly strikes deep inside him. Roberts and Brown come towards him, followed by a dozen Grannies. Isobar helps them climb a tree while explaining that he doesn\u2019t actually have the armored tank they called for. Once there, he explains his idea to them about playing his bagpipes so that the Dome would hear them and come to their rescue. The air conditioning valve was nearby, so the sound would carry. As he begins to play, the Grannies fall to the ground and remain there. Supposedly resting, Isobar keeps playing until backup arrives. They are shocked to find that Isobar\u2019s playing didn\u2019t just put the Grannies to sleep, it actually killed them. Isobar made a huge scientific discovery and rescued his companions. ",
        "Summary_2": "Horatio \"Isobar\" Jones is a meteorologist working a one-year term in the Experimental Dome at the Lunar III frontier outpost on Earth's moon, Luna. Isobar is lean and gangly and has a good working relationship with others at the outpost. However, Isobar has begun to miss Earth and the feeling of nature, since it is prohibited to leave the Dome due to the existential threat of the Grannies. He asks Sparks Riley to request the radioman show him the view outside when Sparks calls Earth to relay Isobar's weather report; when Sparks tells him Patrolmen Roberts and Brown have left the Dome to conduct routine maintenance Outside, Isobar feels jealous. He begins to loathe the recycled air in the dome and the clammy feeling it creates on his skin. Isobar becomes easily irritated and lashes out with profanities. Dr. Loesch suggests to Sparks that Isobar is the victim of \"weltschmertz\", an intense kind of world-weariness that can drive a person to extreme measures to feel happiness again. The only activity that brings Isobar joy anymore is playing the bagpipes, which disturbs his co-workers so much that Commander Eagan eventually orders him to stop playing it. This command sends Isobar over the edge, and he tricks Junior Patrolman Wilkins into giving up his post at the entrance gate so that he can leave the Dome and go outside to get some fresh air and play his bagpipes in peace. While he is outside, Isobar runs into Roberts and Brown, who are running away from a group of Grannies. After they take refuge up a tree, Isobar plays his bagpipes in order to signal Sparks for help. In the process, he learns that the music of the bagpipes has a powerful sedative effect upon the Grannies--so much so that it actually kills them.",
        "Summary_3": "Isobar Jones\u2019s real name is Horatio. He joined the Frontier Services six months ago because he was eager to go on an adventure on the moon and do something exciting with his life. He is deeply disappointed in his decision because he gets very little joy out of his job. He enjoys making observations about the meteorological patterns on Earth, but he does not like the constant instructions from the Dome Commander. Most of all, he hates being trapped inside without fresh air and the familiar feeling of sunshine warming his skin. He brought his bagpipes to the Lunar III because playing music is one of his favorite hobbies, but his coworkers become annoyed with his incessant playing. There is nowhere for him to go and play that won\u2019t bother others. The music travels through the air conditioning system, and it\u2019s impossible to turn it off. After the Dome Commander receives several complaints, he decides to make a rule forbidding all instruments. Isobar is devastated. He was already feeling depressed and anxious, but prohibiting music is the final straw for him. He devises a plan to go Outside to play his bagpipes, which is strictly forbidden. He knows that there\u2019s a real possibility that he will run into a Graniteback, but he assumes that he can run away from them quickly. After he tricks a guard into leaving his post, he moseys outside and travels two miles away from the gate to the building. There, he encounters Brown and Roberts, who both believe that Isobar has been sent to help them. Their calls to the station have gone unanswered, and they quickly realize that Isobar does not have an armored vehicle. He\u2019s actually equipped with his bagpipes. Isobar\u2019s idea to climb a nearby tree to escape a pack of Grannies buys the men time, and his next idea, to play his instrument to alert their colleagues that they're in need of help, actually saves their lives. Isobar does not intend to kill the Grannies with his music, but they fall to the ground and die after hearing him play. ",

He has been there for six months, and is developing a kind of stir-craziness from the sterile living environment and being forbidden from his one true joy - playing the bagpipes. Dr. Loesch claims he has a sickness called weltschmertz, which is a dangerous mental condition of \u201cworld sickness\u201d that can make a person do wild things.\nIsobar delivers a weather forecast to the transmission tower early in the story where he begs his colleague to have the Earth receiver person turn the video feed around to their window. This demonstrates how much Isobars longs for the outdoors that a video feed out a window on Earth soothes him. He is strictly forbidden from playing the bagpipes or from going \u201cOutside\u201d to the adjacent hemispheric dome that houses a lush valley by the Dome Commander Eagan. Being overcome with his desire for both the bagpipes and to go Outside, Isobar defies orders, tricks a guard into leaving his post, and sets into the lush Outside. It is deeply restorative for him, but he is snapped to reality when he discovers his colleagues, Brown and Roberts, are being attacked by Grannies. \nIsobar is helpless to assist them other than suggesting they all climb a tree. To their luck, the Grannies can\u2019t climb, but they start ramming the tree until it is obvious that they will all die up there soon once they knock it over and devour them. Isobar starts playing the bagpipes to alert the attention of Sparks in the tower above them. He is successful in getting the attention of Sparks who comes with a tank to rescue them, but even more amazingly his bagpipe music has killed all the of the Grannies at the base of the tree. \nIsobar becomes the hero of the story, since his bagpipe music is the first thing known to be capable of killing the Grannies, which will allow humans to now study them and perhaps make advancements to their settlement on Luna. \n"

        "Summary_1": "The setting is primarily at an event space called the Space Room. Jimmie Stanley and his band perform there. They are sitting in the cocktail lounge waiting for the replacement for their fiddle player to arrive. Their boss, Ke-teeli, is upset that the fiddle player is not yet there. He is threatening to not let them play at the venue anymore. Eventually, their replacement player arrives at the venue. However, Jimmie has serious doubts that man will be able to play well because his instrument does not look like a fiddle and he appears disheveled. When the band does play with the new member, John Smith, he and his instrument \u2013 the Zloomph \u2013 sounds amazing. The audience shows a good reception as does the boss. \n\nJimmie wants John to join the band, but John has other concerns. He continuously mentions holes and seems obsessed over finding holes. Eventually, Jimmie learns why John is interested in holes. John claims that he accidentally went through a hole and left his time dimension. He is in search of holes in order to find his original time dimension. Jimmie attempts to play along with John\u2019s claims and even offers to let John stay at his apartment in order to entice him to join the band. John continues to drink beer and talk about holes during the story. \n\nOne night, Jimmie returns back to his apartment and finds John drunk on the floor. He takes John, and the instrument, outside to calm John down. When they go outside, John and his instrument fall through a hole and are not seen again. Jimmie and the rest of the band assume that John managed to find his way back to his own time zone.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "Jimmie Stanley is the piano player in a band, and the story begins at The Space Room where the band is waiting for a temporary bass fiddle man to arrive. This is because the original bass fiddle man, Ziggy, injured his fingers. The boss Ke-teeli does not seem to like their music that much. Now that a member is missing and the replacement player has not yet arrived, the boss starts to doubt that the three members of the band can perform good music. He doesn\u2019t think that the customers will be satisfied. The band\u2019s contract with the boss ends this week, and the boss does not seem to want to continue the contract. Finally, the temporary bass fiddle player arrives with his instrument. He introduces himself as John Smith and tells them that he is late because he was working on his plan. At first, Jimmie doubt that the ancient bass fiddle can make any beautiful sound. But he becomes very surprised once he hears the beautiful music. The audiences are focused and intrigued by the music. Even the boss becomes delight after hearing the music. Later, John begins to notice the holes on the clarinet and the piano, which seems quite odd to the band. Noting his talents in music and the facial expression on the boss\u2019 face, Jimmie asks John to play for the long term. But John rejects stating that he needs to work on his plan. John mentions that there are many holes in the universe, but he cannot find the right one to go back to prove a point to the University. Believing that Jimmie understands him, he decides to play with the band. The boss agrees to give them the contract if John stays. For the next few days, John becomes popular and then a reporter come to interview him. After telling the reporter about the holes, the reporter decides to leave.

        "Summary_3": "An Earth music band of four is supposed to play at The Space Room on Mars, but the bass man is injured. The band boss, Ke-teeli, is discontented with the group and won't prolong the contract, he wants to cancel the concert. Jimmie Stanley, the leader of the band, is waiting for the bass man's replacement to save the band. If the band loses the job, they have nowhere to go. After a while of waiting, a huge monstrosity enters The Space Room accompanied by a little guy in a suit, a matchstick. The newcomer is John Smith, the bass man from Mars, who is late because he has been working on his plan of getting back home. When the band starts playing, everyone is enchanted with John's playing, which is the best and the most unique sound they've ever heard. During the intermission, John mentions that his fiddle is over five thousand years old but its hole isn't right for going home. Jimmie is confused with this and the band continues playing. John stares at the holes in the instruments of the rest of the band. At intermission Jimmie offers John a drink to urge him to join the band. John is unwilling to accept the offer as he is more interested in history and his plan than in music. Turns out he fell into a hole a while ago and now he can't get back to his time dimension. For three days John plays with the band and talks of holes to Jimmie, whom he sees as an understanding person. Then John is interviewed and the reporter won't listen about his holes, so he decides to quit the band and continue searching for them. Next day Jimmie leaves for a while thinking about how to urge the bass man to stay, and when he returns, John is drunk with beer. The two go out and suddenly John disappears. The band can't find him anywhere and their contract ends. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The story begins on a Saturday night at The Space Room. Jimmie Stanley and two other members of his band are sitting in the bandstand of the cocktail lounge. The bass fiddle man, Ziggy, is not present because he had almost sliced his fingers off while opening a can of Santurnian ice-fish. The boss Ke-teeli, also known as Goon-Face, is furious that no music is being played at the establishment. They explain that a Marsport local has been called a stand-in for the bassist, while Ke-teeli is suspicious. John Smith from the Marsport union comes in shortly after. Jimmie is intimidated by his bass fiddle, and John Smith explains that he knows how to play everything. As they begin playing, John Smith plays a whole chord with each beat on his bass. The customers are in some trance, and even bland-faced Martians begin nodding in time to the rhythm. After their performance, John Smith explains that his instrument is over five thousand years old, and it is not a fiddle but the only Zloomph in existence. He points out the holes on the other band member\u2019s instruments. Jimmie tries to convince him to join the combo, but John explains that he does not care much for playing even when Jimmie offers to share his apartment. He is focused on his plan, which involves studying holes and how they relate to the universe. John further explains that he fell through his time dimension while hurrying back to the University with his Zloomph to prove something in ancient history. Jimmie agrees to listen to him if he plays with them, which makes John extremely happy. John becomes extremely popular with all of the customers, and Goon-Face tells Jimmie that they will continue to have their contract if the bass fiddle man stays. A reporter approaches John for an interview over beer, and he tries to tell him his plan. However, it turns out that the reporter does not understand, and John is down again. Fat Boy exclaims that they are also working on a plan in an attempt to make him stay. As Jimmie thinks about what can make John stay, he comes up with a variety of plans. As he returns to his apartment in the early afternoon, he finds John squatting on the floor and surrounded by beer bottles. John is scared because he is covered in holes, but Jimmie is not convinced and takes him out to get some fresh air. It is four AM in the morning; suddenly, John disappears through the manhole with his Zloomph. Jimmie jumps into it after him, but he has completely disappeared without a trace. Goon-Face does not offer them another contract, and they desperately search everywhere for John. Ziggy, now healed, signs up for a trip to the uranium pits, and Jimmie is furious at whoever let John back to his time dimension. However, he knows that they cannot sue the city without a corpus delecti. "

        "Summary_1": "John Smith is interested in holes because he wants to go back to his own time dimension. He explains to Jimmie that his colleagues did not believe that before the tapes, instruments that played music existed. He further details that on his way back to the University with his instrument, the Zloomph, he fell through a hole and out of his own time dimension. He states that a researcher is to blame for not securing a force field over the hole to prevent someone from falling through. John Smith is interested in holes because he believes that any hole could potentially bring him back to his own time dimension so that he can prove that this theory was credit. He does not want people to think that he was wrong. ",
        "Summary_2": "He is interested in the holes because he needs to find the correct one in order to go home. He mentions that the foundation of their cultures is based on the history of all the time dimensions. The different dimensions are interwoven and the holes can provide insights into the different dimensions. Similar to time or space travel. Back in his time, he was proving a point to the University, but some researcher forgot to set a force-field for the hole, thus, he fell through the hole into Jimmie\u2019s time. He needs to go back immediately. If he doesn\u2019t, the University will think that he cannot prove his theory and ran away. But because everything are made up of holes \u2013 even his body has holes \u2013 John becomes worried of not able to find the correct one. ",
        "Summary_3": "John Smith desperately wants to return home and believes that finding the right hole is the way. There are many time dimensions interwoven through the ages and the holes let people travel between and study them. Such a hole may be anything, so it's almost impossible to find the inter-dimensional one. John fell into one in the dark in his dimension, that way he showed up in this place, but he wants to return, so he studies every hole. The fall prevented John from proving his point about ancient history to some scientists and he doesn't want them to consider him a coward. He needs to return to his dimension and prove the point. ",
        "Summary_4": "John Smith is interested in holes because he believes that he can return to his time dimension through the right one. During his conversation with Jimmie, he explains that holes are a first-hand method of studying time dimensions and cultures. All of the objects around them, including the beer bottles, doors, caves, animal holes, mines, faces, and clothes, all have millions of holes. However, even with all of these holes, John is desperate because he cannot find the right one to return home. He blames his initial travel on some fool of a researcher who forgot to set a force-fold over the hole that he fell through in his dimension. "

This is the last week before the band\u2019s contract with The Goon ends. The band is worried that The Goon will not continue the contract since he has been showing little enthusiasm for their music. He always comment either too fast and loud or too slow and soft. He even states that it is better to have the customers disappointed than have them hear bad music.

Jimmie believes that the real reason is that there is not enough business in the establishment. Even when Jimmie says that the three of them will continue to play, if the fourth does not show up, Goon-Face is not impressed and says that having no music is better than bad music. He even tells them that if no bassist shows up, then they will go home. Once John Smith plays, he is pleased and beams like a kitten who has seen a quart of cream. Business begins to get better, but he is still cautious of the contract. He tells the band that he will only continue their contract if John Smith stays and signs it. After John disappears, he is furious again and refuses to discuss any contract because the bass fiddle man is gone. "

Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n  \n \n  \"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\n  \n \n  We watched.\n  \n \n  John murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\n  \n \n  John yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\n  \n \n  John sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\n  \n \n  The reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\n  \n \n  John finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\n  \n \n  I rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\n  \n \n  We were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n  \n \n  \"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\n  \n \n  I patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n  \n \n  \"How?\" John asked.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy gulped.\n  \n \n  \"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Jimmie\u2019s friend, Hammer-Head talks about the black puts of Neptune as a place that he and the rest of the band will likely go to if they do not secure a contract with The Goon. The black pits of Neptune is a place for musicians that are past their prime. \n\nThe Goon does not enjoy the band\u2019s music and threatens to not let them play at his establishment anymore. However, The Goon likes the music when John Smith plays with the band and especially the reception of the audience when John Smith is playing with the band. The Goon says that he will give the band a contract as long as John Smith agrees to join with his Zloomph. It is important to Jimmie for John to continue playing with the band so that they can get an employment contract from The Goon. \n",
        "Summary_2": "It is important for Jimmie to continue playing with the band because the boss was not satisfied with their music before his arrival. Their contract ends this week, but it seems the boss is unlikely to continue it. After he plays his music on the bass fiddle, the boss is surprised by it. He enjoys the music. The audiences also like it. Noticing the change in the boss\u2019 attitude towards the music, Jimmie knows that he has to persuade John to join the band in order to get a contract. Later, the boss explicitly states that there will be a contract if the bass fiddle man stays, else there won\u2019t be any. Thus, Jimmie has to make John stay in the band. ",
        "Summary_3": "The future of the whole band depends on John. The bass man hurt his fingers and he needs replacement. John is much better that the bass men, his music is extremely unique and even the most indifferent people in the room pay attention to it. Everyone adores him playing, without him the band was never really popular. Their concerts were not payed off well, their music didn't touch people, their boss was discontented. Their contract is ending and to prolong it they need John. Jimmie cares for the future of his band and the contract a lot as they can't do any other job and unsuccessful musicians can only go to the uranium pits of Neptune, where life is short. They don't even have money for fare. ",
        "Summary_4": "It is important to Jimmie for John to continue playing because the band will be allowed to continue playing in The Space Room and get their contracts renewed with Goon-Face. He considers John to be the best bass player in the galaxy and wants him to continue so the band can continue to earn a living. Jimmie even offers John a place to stay and doesn\u2019t mind babying him for the rest of his life if it means that the other man will continue to play the bass. His plans include breaking John\u2019s leg, finding an Earth blonde to capture his interest, or even forging a letter from the University to tell him that his theory is valid as a means of getting the man to stay.

Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\n   \n   Rhapsody of The\nStars\n   \n  . He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  \u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\n  \n \n  But after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\n  \n \n  John Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought again.\n  \n \n  Awhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\n  \n \n  He pointed.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\n  \n \n  It didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\n  \n \n  Conclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\n  \n \n  At intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\n  \n \n  His grunt was negative.\n  \n \n  \"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled. \"Yes, I\n   \n   like\n   \n  beer.\"\n  \n \n  I escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n  \n \n  \"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\n  \n \n  John yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\n  \n \n  He made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n  \n \n  \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\n  \n \n  His watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\n  \n \n  He yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n  \n \n  \"What\n   \n   do\n   \n  you like to do, John?\"\n  \n \n  His string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\n  \n \n  Oh Lord, that plan again!\n  \n \n  I took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\n   \n   must\n   \n  be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  He made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\n  \n \n \n   Oh, oh\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   But you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n   \n \n \n  \"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\n  \n \n  I winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\n  \n \n  His voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\n  \n \n  He glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\n  \n \n  He was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n  \n \n  \"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  to prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools. They don't believe that instruments\nwhich make music actually\nexisted before the tapes!

Did you drop something,\nlose it in the hole\u2014is that why you\nhave to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh I didn't lose anything important,\"\nhe snapped, \"\n   \n   just\n   \n  my own\ntime dimension. And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\n  \n \n  His chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account. Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\n   \n   you\n   \n  .\n   \n   You\n   \n  understand.\"\n  \n \n  Thank heaven!\n  \n<doc-sep>From the entrance of\n   \n   The\nSpace Room\n   \n  came a thumping\nand a grating and a banging. Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\n  \n \n  The fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\n  \n \n  His pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\n  \n \n  The bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\n  \n \n  A moment's silence.\n  \n \n  \"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n  \n \n  \"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n \n  My gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\n   \n   On An Asteroid\nWith You\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know\n   \n   everything\n   \n  ,\" said John\nSmith.\n  \n \n  I turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\n  \n \n  And I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\n  \n \n  My eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\n  \n \n  The tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\n  \n \n  First they went\n   \n   Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n   \n  ,\nand then,\n   \n   boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n   \n  ,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\n  \n \n  But there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\n  \n \n  I glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\n  \n \n  I looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\n  \n \n  We finished\n   \n   On An Asteroid With\nYou\n   \n  , modulated into\n   \n   Sweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\n   \n  and finished with\n   \n   Tighten Your Lips on Titan\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  We waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n  \n \n  \"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  . This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\n  \n \n  I wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\n  \n \n  He turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "John Smith is a human from Earth that is described as a very shot guy with a broad face and light blue eyes. He works with the Marsport union. When he enters the Space Room establishment, he is dressed in a tight black suit and is carrying his instrument, the Zloomph. John states that the Zloomph that he carries is an instrument that is over five thousand years old. He excitedly states that he found it in a pawn shop and that it\u2019s the only one in existence. \n\nThe Zloomph itself is described as being incredibly large, and very black. The tones that emitted from it were jazz-like and received well by the band, the audience, and The Goon. \n",

John Smith is a little man, he is described as a matchstick. His face is flat and broad. He has sandcolored hair that is quite messy, long and dry. His blue eyes are watery. He wears a black color tightfitting suit. He is between twenty and forty. He speaks quickly. He does not like Venusian fizz and wine-syrup, but enjoys beer. He has a dreamy expression when playing music on his instrument. John is always noticing holes that seems common to everyone else.

The man has pale blue eyes and his age is indeterminable. He is silent almost all the time, but he loves beer, and it makes him talk. He mostly talks about the holes, as he is desperately seeking for the trans-dimensional one to get back to his time dimension. All the time he makes plans about it, also he is interested in history and proving theories about it.

He also has pale, watery blue eyes and wears a tight-fitting black suit. Jimmie says it is impossible to guess his age as he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. When John speaks, it is shrill and rapid. However, when he talks about the holes and his ancient history theories, he becomes much more enthusiastic and lights up. Other than those times, he is quite silent and has sad eyes. The others find him eccentric, but they want to keep him around because of his bass-playing abilities. His instrument is called a Zloomph. It is an enormous black monstrosity, and Jimmie thinks it came from a pawnbroker\u2019s attic. It is a queerly-shaped bass fiddle. It is also too tall and too wide. John says the Zloomph is over five thousand years old and is the only one in existence. It can play any song, and the sound that comes out of it is the whole chord instead of just a single note.

        "Query": "What is the story of THE VALLEY about?",
        "Article": "Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When\nthey came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains,\nactually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on\nwalking.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that\nthere is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it,\neither, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is\ngiven an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the\nConquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had\nto.\"\n  \n \n  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded\nhills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied\ntogether with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond\nthem were those from\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , too freshly dead to have decayed\nmuch ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and\nMarsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve\nmiles from the ship\u2014horizontally.\n  \n \n  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the\nfresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace\nbeside the canal.\n  \n \n  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd\nbeen older when they got her.\"\n  \n \n  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the\nleaves floating down it.\n  \n \n  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never\nseem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\nin the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n \n  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm\ncity. He didn't look back.\n  \n \n  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet\nI seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago.\nAre\u2014are the climbers still climbing\u2014somewhere, Helene?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe.

        "Summary_1": "Michael and Mary were sent to look for another planet for humans to live on. After looking for two thousand years, their \"Milky Way\" expedition had failed to find an alternative, but humans were desperate because Earth was scorched and not easily liveable. The President is taken aback by the news, and his council looked at some footage from the expedition, watching ships explode and seeing dangerous atmospheres that would not sustain human life. A thousand people were grown from cultured scar tissue only to die violent deaths, so people yelled for the video to be shut off. President Davis explains that violent death is an unfamiliar thing to the contemporary humans, so he decided to lie to the public about the expedition details. Michael had promised Mary they would stay on Earth, but the government lying to the public was hard--Mary suggests that Michael can still leave, but he doesn't want to go without her, and she wants to stay on the planet she came from, even if it means a difficult life on Earth. They remember their lockets, that give them the option of a quick death in case they had gotten trapped in a dangerous situation, but they don't want to threaten to kill themselves either. Mary admits she's pregnant, which is surprising because humans in this day are cultured from scar tissue. With heavy hearts, they looked out onto the city where the large TV screens were promising the public an idyllic planet that would one day be recovered again, through a different mission, which is disheartening because their own mission had turned into a lie. They went back into the council chambers and sat again. Michael and Mary were told they'd be kept in solitary confinement to protect the public, which was ironic since Mary wanted to stay on Earth to avoid loneliness. Michael reminds the President of the lockets he and his wife have, and there is panic--what is there to do? The President demanded they hand over the lockets, but Michael and Mary stay strong and ask to be let outside of the city's protective barrier so that they can experience a natural death. The President conceded, so that he didn't have to look at them anymore, and gave them the car that they asked for. They have supplies to last a year, but don't know where to go or what to do. They get out of their car and take their shoes off to walk around, experiencing quiet for the first time in memory. To their surprise, they found three blades of grass, and run to a hill to see other patches of green in the area, some animals, and a small spring. They have hope: they can build a house, have a child, and eventually they can show the ones in the city that there is hope much closer than they realized. ",
        "Summary_2": "Michael and Mary arrive back on Earth after a 2,000-year expedition scouting the galaxy for any potential new planets for humans to move to. After finding nothing, Michael is hesitant to report the news back to Earth and wants to stay in space. Mary, however, insists they return to Earth, so they step out of their spaceship and give the first press conference detailing their failed exploit. Michael does not hold back on the details and shocks the hopeful humans to their core. The President pulls them aside and interrogates them with his council. They share all the pictures from their adventures into the galaxy, showing yellow aliens, planets with deadly atmospheres, and horrific images of the other couples on the expedition dying. The council becomes ill at the images of their gruesome deaths, so the President shuts down the slideshow. Apparently, humans were no longer accustomed to violent deaths, as they hadn\u2019t had to see any for thousands of years. The last time such an occurrence happened, a man was struck and killed by a ground car, and all the witnesses were driven mad. The President had shut down any potential violent deaths from then on. \nThe President asks for hope from Michael and Mary, but they are unable to give him any. They send them out of the chambers to deliberate their fate. Michael and Mary discuss their options. Mary wants to stay and die on Earth, while Michael wants to escape. They decide to use their lockets which cause instant death for the wearers to force the council\u2019s hand. Mary reveals that she is pregnant, something that hasn\u2019t occurred for three thousand years due to overpopulation laws, and Michael agrees to stay on Earth. \nThey return to the chambers, and the President delivers their verdict. They are condemned to isolation until the next expedition is set out, because he fears they will reveal the truth to Earth. He sent out a broadcast earlier saying there was hope after all, as they had found a planet, but lost it, so another expedition would be sent out soon. Michael and Mary refuse their isolation, and threaten to kill themselves with the lockets unless they are released and given a ground car and supplies. The President agrees after he and his congregation are thrown by the thought of watching someone die in front of their eyes. \nThe story flashes forward to Mary and Michael driving out of the city and into the sandy mountains. They come to a valley and step out of the car, placing their bare feet on the soil. Mary sees three blades of grass and shows Michael excitedly. They run down the hill and discover baby trees, flowers, wildlife, and a small stream. The Earth is healing itself, and they had the proof. Thrilled that htey will be able to live off the land, they start planning where they will put their cabin and when they will reintroduce this new Earth to humanity. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Michael and Mary are returning from a mission to discover other planets in the Milky Way suitable for human colonization. During their exploration, which spanned two thousand years, the one thousand other humans sent with them had all died. They are the lone survivors, returning to Earth with grave news that there is no other place in the galaxy humans can move to. The remaining humans on Earth are overjoyed when they make radio contact because their life on Earth is confined to a city huddled around a water hole in a desert where their technology for distilling the salty water is the only thing keeping them alive on a planet they condemn as devoid of any other resources.\n \nMichael is hesitant to land on Earth, but Mary is determined to spend the rest of her life there now. They land and deliver a speech to a cheering crowd of white faces that are the same as those that had cheered when their mission departed two thousand years ago. Humans have technology to tissue culture new bodies and effectively become immortal. Pregnancy was outlawed 3000 years ago to control the population, and ever since then they have been regenerating their bodies. Michael announces that there are no other habitable planets. President Davis begs Michael to retract what he has said, and tells the public that there has been a mistake, that everything will be \u201call right\u201d, and that they should go back to work and wait for more information. \nMichael and Mary are brought to the council to deliver a 60 second video documenting their entire two thousand year mission. Most disturbing is that it shows the violent deaths of many explorers - some being sucked into the gravity of foreign planets, or their ships exploding after colliding with meteors. Violent death was last witnessed on Earth hundreds of years ago, and all of the witnesses went insane. The video is shocking and disturbing. The President quickly denies the validity of the video evidence, desperately trying to avoid any hysteria by the public. Michael and Mary are told to wait outside the council chambers while their fate is decided. \nMichael thinks they should have never landed on the planet, but Mary reveals she is pregnant and wants to remain on Earth. They plan to leave the city by threatening to kill themselves in front of the council. Out the window, they glimpse a public screen projection showing that there is going to be a new mission to space and everything will be \u201call right\u201d. The council decides Michael and Mary will be placed in solitary confinement. The couple threaten to kill themselves using their lockets in front of the council, a violent death that would make those who see it go insane. They demand a ground car with a year of supplies, which they are granted. They leave the city together and soon discover an oasis with spring water to build a house next to and raise their child.",
        "Summary_4": "Michael and Mary return to Earth from a 2,000-year-long mission to find a planet suitable for human habitation because Earth's resources have slowly dwindled away due to human greed and atomic war. Michael would rather end his life than tell those remaining on Earth that their mission had failed, but Mary believes they owe it to the one thousand who had perished on the expedition to reveal the truth to them. Besides, 2,000 years away from Earth is a long time, and she misses home. A crowd eagerly welcomes them, including President Davis, and Michael soon confesses no planets exist that can support human life. He and Mary have returned to Earth to stay and die. President Davis whisks them away from the troubled crowd and brings them to the council chambers, where Michael and Mary reveal the documentary footage of their trip. They show the council hundreds of years' worth of visual evidence of all the planets they visited, all the strange creatures they encountered, and, worst of all, the explicit, violent deaths of their fellow travelers. Upon seeing these deaths, the council members insist Michael and Mary turn off the footage. They are horrified by the violent images because it has been hundreds of years since any human has died a violent death; seeing such images would drive them insane. As the President and council members discuss the couple's fate, Michael and Mary await their decision and discuss what to do next. Michael wants to go back to space, while Mary wants to stay on Earth because she has grown weary of traveling and exhausted by the process of reincarnation that has kept them both alive for 2,000 years. Mary reminds Michael of the lockets they carry--lockets that were given to them prior to departing for their journey that have the power to kill them instantly in order to avoid a painful death. Mary suggests using this locket as leverage against the council, who would grant whatever they asked in exchange for not having to witness their gruesome suicides in person. She also reveals she is pregnant. Later, President Davis announces the council has altered their documentary footage in order to spare the hope of their people, and he tells Michael and Mary that they will spend the rest of their lives in solitary confinement with everything provided for them, including the tools of reincarnation. At that moment, Michael threatens to trigger his locket unless the council gives him and Mary a ground car and provisions and lets them leave the force walls surrounding the last-remaining Earth settlement. President Davis grants their wish. Together, Michael and Mary head out into the desolation of Earth. Soon they discover evidence of new life on Earth including grass, birds, and water. They set out to build their home and prepare to restore civilization."

The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same.

Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks.

And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city.

        "Summary_1": "Michael and Mary are two humans who were sent on an expedition to find a habitable planet elsewhere in the solar system after humans destroyed their own planet during the Atomic Wars, and continued to drive it into the ground through their own greed for resources. Three thousand years after the Wars, the expedition was sent out (so five thousand years have passed in total since the Wars). Michael and Mary are the only two people who survived, and their return was two thousand years after they left Earth. They are married, though contemporary relationships do not involve much physical touching as compared to the twenty-first century, in a few ways. When Michael hugs Mary to comfort her, he mentions that it is a custom of the past. In their society, it is illegal to have children through sexual intercourse, so it is a surprise at the end of the story when Mary admits that she might be pregnant. They have endured a lot together on their mission in outer space, and have had to watch a lot of people die. It was very isolating to be in space, living on a ship, and this is part of their other major discussion: what to do when their mission was over. Michael had some desire to stay in space and not return to the scorched planet. However, Mary wanted to return to Earth, and the two of them wanted to stay together no matter what. This turned out to work in their favor: staying on Earth but wanting to stay alive is what gave them the opportunity to find the patches of life they found at the end of the story. ",
        "Summary_2": "The first initial conflict of the story is the debate between Michael and Mary as to whether or not to return to the stars or stay on Earth. Mary wants to place her feet on solid ground again and die with the earth as humans were meant to do, but Michael wants to return to space and escape the burden of sharing their catastrophic news with their fellow man.  Mary wins the debate, claiming that she hasn\u2019t asked much of Michael over their 2,000-year relationship. \nAs the story continues, the reader sees how they deal with their trauma differently. Michael still wants to return to space and asks Mary if they can after presenting their findings to the President\u2019s council. She says he can go without her, but he doesn\u2019t think he could be away from her. Mary wants to die on the earth, while Michael wants to escape to space once again. When Michael hears that Mary is pregnant, he hops on board with her idea to stay on Earth. \nMichael and Mary are clearly a team. They have worked and existed together for 2,000 years without change and have watched all their friends and colleagues die. This trauma clearly bonded them, as Michael says he could never return to space without Mary. Although they may differ, they reach compromises and work together to find the best solution for the two of them. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Michael and Mary are two humans from Earth who have effectively become immortal through a scar tissue culturing technology that allows them to continually regenerate entirely new bodies for themselves as their bodies grow old and die. They have been regenerating their bodies like this, and living on a spaceship together exploring the Milky Way for 2000 years. They love each other deeply.\nWhen they finally return to Earth to deliver the horrible news that there is no other planet in the galaxy that humans can live on, Mary declares to him that she must stay on Earth. She insists that she has loved him for so long (thousands of years) and has asked for very little except for them to now remain on Earth. \nMichael feels as though they should not have ever landed on Earth, but instead wishes they just delivered their message by radio and returned back into space. He can\u2019t understand why she wants to live on Earth when it is so desolate. However, he says that he can not be without her and will kill himself if he were to go back into space alone. When Mary reveals in private to Michael that she is pregnant, they know they will not be accepted by society and hatch a plan to leave the city together. A human has not given birth to a child for 3000 years on Earth. Pregnancy was forbidden to reduce the population until it was low enough that there were sufficient resources available to sustain those that remained.\nThey successfully escape their city and the fate of solitary confinement from the council by threatening to kill themselves with their lockets, which would be a violent death that would cause the onlookers to go insane. This is so shocking and unacceptable to the council that the President grants them a ground car and a year of supplies to leave the city and never return. Michael and Mary find an oasis with vegetation and fresh spring water not far on their journey outside the city. It is a place for them to build a house and raise their child, which is joyful for both of them.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Michael and Mary are a couple deeply in love. They join a crew of one thousand other humans, also comprised of couples, who leave Earth in order to find another habitable planet. As their fellow travelers slowly die over the course of 2,000 years, Michael and Mary continue to reincarnate through a special process of culturing their scar tissue. They also carry lockets that can kill them instantly when triggered and help them avoid a painful death. When they realize their mission has failed, Michael and Mary return to Earth to announce the news. Michael wishes to go back to space since he cannot stand the desolation of Earth and would rather spend the rest of his existence with Mary exploring the universe. Mary wants to stay on Earth because she misses her home and because she is pregnant, although she does not reveal this to Michael until just before President Davis reveals his decision to place the couple in solitary confinement. Michael is shocked because pregnancy had been banned on Earth at the time that atomic war and human greed had laid bare the planet's essential resources. Together, they decide to use their lockets as leverage against the council to force them to permit them to leave the city. Soon after doing so, they discover Earth is regenerating, and they will be able to make a new home for their child."

It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n  \n \n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n  \n \n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Michael and Mary were on a mission to find a habitable planet after the Atomic Wars decimated Earth, making it barely habitable. It was a long journey, and the two have been gone from Earth for a long time--they had undergone reincarnation for two thousand years. However, nobody else on the expedition made it--all of the children who were created through the culturing of scar tissue died in various ways, including ships suffering violent explosions and being struck by rocks in space. This meant that a thousand other people died, and Mary wanted to keep living for the sake of these people that perished on the mission. They returned to Earth on their ship called the Milky Way with the bad news that none of the planets they encountered would have been able to sustain human life, and even if they had found one, the journey there would have been so dangerous that a vast majority of the people who attempted to travel there would never have made it alive.",
        "Summary_2": "Two thousand years before The Valley by Richard Stockham begins, Michael, Mary, and a thousand other couples were sent out into space to locate a new home for the humans. The Atomic Wars and several thousand years of greed, gluttony, and selfishness destroyed the Earth, leaving behind only a barren wasteland. Presumably, the President created new laws to protect humans as is, curbing population growth and finding new ways to grow food and exist on this barren planet. All humans are crowded in one city and exist through reincarnation, so no babies can be born. \nSince the Earth was truly no longer able to support any sort of life (be it flora or fauna), a grand expedition was sent out to see if a mass exodus could occur. However, after two thousand years of searching, Michael and Mary conclude that humans were given one planet and one planet only. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Michael and Mary were sent on an exploratory space mission from Earth with one thousand other humans to discover other planets in the Milky Way that were suitable for human colonization. The purpose of the mission was to move humanity to a new planet after the destruction of Earth from atomic wars and greed. During their two thousand year exploration, the thousand others sent with them had all died. They had seen many life forms on different planets and a variety of alien creatures. The thousand others with them had died violent deaths in the dangers of space, sometimes hurtling into alien planets or exploding by meteor collisions.\nWhat they discovered is that Earth is the only planet habitable for humans and there is no other place in the galaxy that they can go. This is shocking news to the rest of the people of Earth, who have been waiting for those two thousand years to have news of hope that there is somewhere else they can move. The resources on Earth have been exploited to an extreme, where the only humans remaining are living in a tightly clustered city around a salty body of water they must pump and distill to sustain themselves, surrounded by dusty desert.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Due to the ravages of atomic war and the insatiable greed of humankind, Earth has been left in a desolate state. The last remaining humans live in a city next to a shrinking sea, from which they gather water through loud, throbbing pumps. Mary describes the situation as a family living in a home that they do not take of; instead, they move from room to room as the house slowly falls to pieces around them. Michael and Mary join a cohort of one thousand other humans who make their way into space in order to discover a new planet suitable for human habitation. Over the course of their 2,000-year journey, they come upon a number of planets, none of which can support human life: Some of the planets have toxic atmospheres, others dangerous winds and animals. Along the way, the rest of their cohort is violently decimated while Michael and Mary remain alive thanks to the process of reincarnation. "

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n  \n \n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work.

        "Summary_1": "In the earth of the future that is at the center of this story, the society has managed to reduce accidents so much that violent deaths do not happen. This happened because some people reacted with hysterics to witnessing death of this type, so efforts were made to avoid the issue entirely, which had been successful for the past few hundred years. President Davis did not want the public to hear any more details about the expedition after Michael and Mary first addressed everyone. He says that the only reason the public has not lost all sense after seeing some of the footage from the expedition is that it was visual media and stories, but not something people witnessed first-hand for themselves. However, he does not want to expose the people to the violent deaths that the people on the expedition suffered, so he claims that Michael and Mary did not tell the truth, in an effort to save face. The President considers this type of lying to be for the good of the people, who cannot handle the reality of the expedition. He also does not think that the people could handle the loss of hope for another planet to live on, which is why he plays the ad campaigns for a new expediton in a different solar system that aims to eventually find (or rediscover, in his words) another planet for humans to inhabit, perhaps in Andromeda. In this way, the President thinks it is better for his people to have false hope instead of no hope at all. The reader sees the irony in this at the end of the story when Michael and Mary find the patch of life that has started to re-establish itself outside of the boundaries of the city they ventured from. ",
        "Summary_2": "Michael and Mary return to Earth after 2,000 years only to report the worst news possible: there is no other virgin planet in this galaxy that has the ability to shelter humans. They announce their news to the public, but the President quickly shuts down the conference and brings them inside so they can report their more detailed findings. After showing them the pictures of the various planets, aliens, and demises of their colleagues, they concur once again that Earth is their only home. However, the President lies to the public, releasing a broadcast stating that they found and lost a planet, and another expedition will be sent out shortly to relocate their new home. He claims that his people need hope to keep going, which may be true. After living for thousands of years through reincarnation on barren Earth, his people are desperate for hope and a new planet. Without hope, their entire society would fall apart, as their eventual deaths would become a very real future. ",
        "Summary_3": "When Michael and Mary land on Earth and report that there are no other habitable planets for humans to move to in the Milky Way galaxy after two thousand years of space exploration, President Davis quickly moves to silence their truth. The President begs Michael to take back what he has said to the people, and when he refuses, the President quickly pivots the message to the public. He declares that there has been a mistake, and tells them that everything will be \u201call right\u201d and that they should all go back to the pumps and distilleries to work and wait for more information.\nMichael and Mary present deeply disturbing video evidence to the President and council detailing the gruesome deaths of their thousand other peers sent on the mission because of the dangers of space travel. Some died by explosions in meteor fields or getting sucked into the gravity of dangerous planetary bodies. The President knows that the people of Earth have not witnessed the image of a violent death in hundreds of years, and that the last time it was seen all the witnesses went insane. The President quickly denies the video evidence in front of the council, saying that what they showed was only a picture, and if it were screened for the rest of the people on Earth there would be mass hysteria.\nThe President is desperately trying to avoid any hysteria by the public, and fears that if they knew the real truth from Michael and Mary that their society would cease to function entirely. The council ultimately decides that Michael and Mary will never be allowed to mingle with the public on Earth because their truth is too dangerous for people to know. They will be taken care of, and allowed to continue their lives as they have been in solitary confinement. The President informs the public that the statement Michael made was untrue, and quickly begins a new ad campaign of hope in the city by announcing a new mission to explore a different galaxy for habitable planets.\n",
        "Summary_4": "When Michael and Mary return from space, President Davis is overwhelmed but hopeful that they have discovered a planet suitable for human life. When Michael unceremoniously reveals that the mission was a failure, President Davis immediately ushers them off stage and takes them before a small council, where they show them the visual footage with evidence proving their mission to be a failure along with the violent deaths of the rest of their thousand-person cohort. President Davis explains that the remaining humans have not seen a violent human death in hundreds of years and seeing such footage would surely drive them insane. The council members themselves lash out and insist the footage be turned off when they see it. After convening privately with the council, President Davis informs Michael and Mary that they have scrubbed the violent footage and replaced it with images intended to give the people hope that there is a habitable planet. He also informs them that they will be placed in solitary confinement with all necessities and comforts provided to them as thanks for their service to humankind. He reasons that keeping them away from the rest of the people will help preserve the image of hope he wants to foster amongst the people."

        "Summary_1": "Michael and Mary, who have both just returned from a long expedition in a spacecraft, each keep a small golden locket around their neck. They were given these when they left on their mission, as a sort of escape hatch: if they were ever caught in a dangerous situation where they would have to die painful deaths, they could scratch themselves with the locket and they would die a quick and painless death instead of suffering. This is the first hint we see at the society's growing avoidance of painful deaths. For the people on the expedition, they were a tool to be used in case of emergency for the sake of the person wearing them. In the context of the society on Earth, however, they were a tool to negotiate the terms of how Michael and Mary would live. They considered threatening using these lockets to kill themselves, which they eventually did in a discussion with the President and his council. After they used the lockets, although they would die painless deaths, it would look very painful to the witnesses as the bodies experienced shock, so President Davis didn't want his people to see this. ",
        "Summary_2": "The lockets were given to all of the many members of the expedition into space to find a new, untainted home planet. These necklaces were outfitted with a device that would kill the wearer, presumably when held up to their throats as is demonstrated in the story, painlessly and quickly. In the 2,000 years since Michael, Mary, and the rest of the expedition left Earth, humans grew unaccustomed to violence. In fact, the sight of a man being killed by a ground car on accident sent all witnesses into a state of utter insanity. This incapacity for violence turns out to be of great use to Michael and Mary, who saw the rest of their team die horrible, bloody deaths over the course of their two-thousand-year-long journey. \nAfter the President condemns Michael and Mary to isolation due to their findings and unwillingness to return to space or lie to the public, the two threaten to kill themselves in front of his whole congregation, which would send the room into shock and panic. People begin to freak out, whispering about how crazy they are, but the President and his colleagues see the real danger in this. They don\u2019t believe Mary and Michael will actually do it, so they step closer to them, which only causes them to bring the lockets closer to their necks. The President and his people\u2019s unfamiliarity with violence saves Michael and Mary from isolation, as the President grants all their wishes in return for their lives. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The lockets were given to the original cohort of space explorers, including Michael and Mary, that went out on a two thousand year mission to find other planets suitable for human colonization in the Milky Way galaxy. The function of the locket is to provide a quick and painless death to the wearer should they be in a situation where they are going to have a painful death. The wearer simply presses the locket and scratches themselves with it to kill themselves. Although painless to them, their bodies appear to writhe and convulse until they go lifeless. \nMichael and Mary use the threat of killing themselves with their lockets in front of the President and the council to demand they be allowed to leave the city in a ground car with supplies instead of being put into solitary confinement for the foreseen future. They cause an uproar in the council chambers when they hold the lockets to their necks, with onlookers shocked and frightened by the thought of their own horrible fate if they witness their death. This is effective, because the death from the locket appears violent to those watching and they fear going insane if they see it.\nLockets are a method for the explorers to kill themselves, which is an interesting juxtaposition to the society remaining on Earth. Their main objective is perpetuating themselves through scar tissue regeneration technology that essentially provides them with immortality, and strict avoidance of death. \n",
        "Summary_4": "Prior to leaving for the mission to find a habitable planet for humans to relocate to, Michael and Mary are both given lockets that can be triggered to cause immediate death. The purpose is to avoid a potentially violent and painful death from whatever threat might be encountered out in unknown space. When they return to Earth 2,000 years later, Michael wants to press the locket rather than return to inform the people of their failure. Mary insists they return, however, presumably because she misses home (in reality, it is because she is pregnant). After President Davis and the council meet privately to determine the couple's fate, Mary reminds Michael that they have a bargaining chip available to them that will allow them to determine their own fate: the lockets. Because humans have not seen violent death in hundreds of years, Mary knows that the council will yield to whatever they demand in exchange for not having to witness their suicides in person. In this way, Michael and Mary negotiate their release from the city and are effectively banished outside the force walls."

        "Summary_1": "This story takes place in the year 2102 and centers around a family with powers, including telekenisis and teleportation. The narrator is Kevin, one of the sons: he is the only person in the family without powers, a \"psi-deficient\", so he stays at home to take care of the house. The story starts at the breakfast table, where the father teleports in, the mother probes the others' thoughts, and there is grumbling about the goings-on in the household. Timothy, the youngest brother, senses turmoil in the family but is also the most hopeful--he figures that Kevin has a gift they just haven't discovered yet, which is encouraging to Kevin. After everyone else in the family leaves for their jobs, Kevin is left to think about his situation, so he goes for a long walk. Reading is his only other real source of entertainment; he doesn't have many friends because nobody wanted to play sports with someone without telepathic abilities. He couldn't explore space because other planets weren't habitable, so he wondered what would make him stand out. The reader learns that the psi powers were latent in humans and developed with exposure to nuclear energy. When he gets home from his walk, Kevin's entire family is there, processing some news. There are two inhabited planets in Alpha Centauri, and the aliens there might be preparing for war.  Kevin partly hoped there would be war for a change of pace, and his mom figured people should start learning first-aid, including Kevin. He had a benefit over his sister because he couldn't sense others' pain in the same way. He met a girl named Lucy in his first-aid class who he liked, and she was a \"low-grade telesensitive\" so he didn't have to worry about his thoughts being read. Once the aliens attacked, things got hard as Kevin had to face the injured people bought to his care. This was especially shocking because injury was not common in his world. This was where Kevin finally found his power: touching the injured people healed them almost instantly. It turned out he was the only human with this power, which was invaluable -- a hospital was even built just for Kevin to work in, where Lucy became his assistant. All at once, he became the most important human on the planet, but the humans had to hide this from their alien adversaries. Lucy was jealous of Kevin but also worried about what would happen to Kevin when the war ended, which it eventually did four months later. The story ends with Kevin returning home after the Vice President informed him that his services were no longer needed. ",
        "Summary_2": "Kevin Faraday is psi-deficient in a family of five with special psi powers living in a world largely free of disease and conflict. His father is telepathic and uses this ability to help him get to long-distance appointments as a traveling salesman. His middle brother, Danny, has the power of telekinesis and works as a junior partner in a moving company. Kevin's sister, Sylvia, can sense emotions in people, so she is able to tell when he purposefully intensifies his anger to make her feel uncomfortable. The youngest of the family is Timothy, who works as a weather forecaster thanks to his powerful gift of prognostication. Kevin's mother is a psychiatrist with telepathic powers that she uses to read his mind. In fact, most people in the world have some kind of telepathic powers--they can read the minds of others unprotected by mind shields. While the rest of the family treats him awkwardly and goes off to their respective jobs every day, Kevin stays at home to maintain the house. However, even this task makes him feel largely useless because most of the chores can be completed by household machines. Therefore, Kevin spends much of his time daydreaming about what life would have been like for him had he been living in 1960 instead of 2102. He feels a stronger empathy for dying plants than he does for other humans, and this has given him the reputation of callousness. Although Kevin is largely resigned to his fate as a psi-deficient in a world of people with special powers, his brother Tim insists that he has some ability; it simply hasn't been discovered yet. The rest of the family shrugs off this notion, but Kevin secretly latches onto this hope. Because of his inability to tap into the telepathically-broadcast news transmissions, Kevin's family one day alerts him that a starship has returned to Earth from Alpha Centauri, where its crew had discovered two Earth-type planets. This excites Kevin, but unfortunately, the inhabitants of these planets are hostile, and they eventually make their way to Earth to begin a war. In preparation for the war, Kevin's mother encourages him and Sylvia to learn first-aid techniques at the Psycho Center in order to be ready to help the injured. During his training, Kevin meets a girl named Lucy, who flirts with him and admires his strength. When Kevin gets his first patient, he is shocked to discover that he is able to heal the injured man with a simple touch of his hands. Having discovered his new ability, Kevin sets out to heal as many of the wounded as possible; later, he learns that he is the only psi-negative in the world with this ability. Eventually, he is given his own hospital and hailed as a hero by various dignitaries including the President. When the war ends and the aliens surrender, however, Earth is no longer in need of his services, and he is out of a job again.\n",
        "Summary_3": "In the year 2102, the Faraday family are setting the table and gathering for a meal together in their home. Humans have supernatural powers (psi-powers) that began to show after nuclear energy was developed in the 1960s, and most of the family have special abilities. Father can teleport, Mother (Amy) is a telepathic psychiatrist, Dan (Danny) can move objects via telekinesis, Sylvia is telesensitive, and Tim can predict the future. Kevin (Kev) has no apparent powers, and feels disconnected and isolated from most of his family because without powers he is of little use to society. The exception is his brother Tim, who suggests that there just isn\u2019t a test yet for the powers that Kev has. His father asks if they should send him to a psychiatrist again, and his mother expresses disappointment at the amount of tests that have been run on Kev with no sign of psi-powers. \nKev is crestfallen that he doesn\u2019t really have any life other than going on long walks and watching the house. He is sad he never had the chance to try exploring space, but by the time he was ten years old humans had already concluded that all the other planets were unsuited to human life. \nThere are television-like telepathic projections in the society called \u201ctellies\u201d that those with psi-powers receive. One day, a tellie reports that space explorers from Earth have found two inhabited Earth-type planets in Alpha Centauri. The aliens chased off the humans in their own spaceships and now it is possible that aliens could attack Earth in less than six months. Kev\u2019s mother decides there will be a lot more people in need of medical training to treat casualties if there is an attack, and recruits Sylvia and Kev to train at the Psycho Center. During training, Kev meets a girl named Lucie who is a poet and they develop a fond relationship with each other. When alien weapons begin striking near their town, the casualties start rolling into the Psycho Center and Kev tries to run away at the first sight of the violent wounds. His mother forces him to stay and work. He is so shaky he can\u2019t hold a sponge to clean the blood off a person that is missing half of their face and drops it, accidentally pushing his fingers into the bloody wound. Touching the wound this way cures it completely. Kev quickly grows into a famous sensation who is able to heal any wounds. He is the only person on Earth with this psi-ability, and there is a special clinic built just for him. Lucie becomes his assistant. Presidents and generals visit him and present him with medals and honors. After four months, the war ends and peace returns to Earth. The Vice President thanks Kev on behalf of the country.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Kevin is the only member of the Faraday family without psi-powers. His two brothers, sister, mother, and father are all extremely powerful individuals, but he, at the ripe age of 26 years old, had nothing. Because of this, he was considered an outcast and was forced to work in their home instead of in the outside world. People pitied him and looked down on him, which drove him crazy. The story begins at the breakfast table with Danny using his powers to levitate food in and out of the kitchen. Chaos ensues as the orange juice crashes into his sister, Sylvia, who senses Kevin\u2019s displeasure at his brazen use of psi-power. Their father soon appears out of thin air with his briefcase, while his mother strolls down and instantly reads Kevin\u2019s mind, only making him madder. The situation escalates until Tim, the youngest, strolls in and claims that Kevin\u2019s powers have yet to present themselves, which gives Kevin hope. His family leaves for work, and Kevin is left at home alone again. \nKevin watches the servomechanisms as they clean and manage the house. Of course, sometimes they break down and he is needed, but largely he has nothing to do and is bored. In the year 2102, Kevin Faraday was considered useless. He takes a long walk that day, and when he returns home, his family is buzzing with the news. A spaceship returned from Alpha Centauri claiming they ran into inhabitable planets filled with humanoid aliens. One of the aliens followed them back to Earth, then turned around and headed home. They were hostile creatures and attacked them on sight. Earth had six months to prepare for the potential of war, so Kevin and his siblings learned first-aid techniques at the Psycho Center. There, Kevin meets Lucy, a cute blonde poetess who expresses interest in him. \nWhen the first bomb strikes, Kevin is faced with his first injured patient. His face had been blown up in the explosion, and Kevin can\u2019t handle the sight, so he tries to run away. He is stopped by his mother, however, who scolds him and sends him back to his patient. As he is mopping his face with a sponge, his hand slips and he accidentally touches his patient skin-to-skin. Miraculously, his injuries are cured, and Kevin\u2019s powers are finally discovered. He is a healer. \nHe heals the rest of the injured with just a touch and soon becomes the most important man in the world. He gets his own special hospital, where Lucy is his assistant, and visits from Presidents, cabinet members, and other people of power. He heals everyone who is injured in the war and loves the new attention. He is the only healer, and those who had his abilities in the past were kings. \nHowever, four months later, the war ends and the Centaurions blow themselves up in surrender. The story ends with a question: will Kevin still be as needed in a post-war society? \n"

His ability is that of prognostication, meaning he is able to predict certain things about the future. This includes positive and negative things.

This is particularly contrasted with Kevin's mother, who doesn't ever speak highly of Kevin.

At breakfast, Tim also feels a sense of ominousness surrounding Kevin, which foreshadows the alien war that happens after the discovery of the Earth-like planets around Alpha Centauri and Kevin's important role in it.

He is expected to be especially good at first aid because he does not feel the emotions of the injured in the way that telepaths do, and thus he should be able to stay more level-headed. However, he is even more effective in first aid that anyone imagined, because when he touches an injured person they heal almost instantaneously. What usually takes days with cure-all is achieved in mere seconds with a touch of Kevin's hand. It is not only the lack of violence that led to Kevin's power going unnoticed: he is the only person in the world with his powers, which makes it incredibly rare, instead of just being a power that nobody was looking for. ",
        "Summary_2": "Hundreds of years prior to the action of the story, human experimentation with nuclear energy released radiation into the air that caused people to develop psi powers, turning them \"into a race of supermen.\" By 2102, the year the story takes place, most people have some kind of unique ability, the most common of which is telepathy. This quality, coupled with the fact that viral disease and sickness have largely been eradicated, has led to the creation of a well-ordered society unused to violence and large-scale suffering. There are places called \"cure-alls\", which help people with physical ailments, but since such issues are rare, cure-alls are also limited. There are transplants and grafts for things like missing arms and legs in this new world, but there is no such treatment for psi-deficiencies. As a psi-negative, Kevin feels like an outcast in his family and in society in general. He struggles to understand what his purpose is until war comes to Earth in the form of a hostile group of aliens from two newly-discovered planets near Alpha Centauri. Kevin trains in first-aid in order to offer assistance to the war-wounded, and in the process, he discovers he has the ability to heal people physically by simply touching them with his hands.",
        "Summary_3": "In the story, Earth had not had war in well over a hundred years and all viruses had been eradicated. The planet was peaceful because there were so many telepaths that there was no longer any capacity for war or crime. Humans started showing these supernatural powers around the 1960s when nuclear energy was being developed. The powers were present, but latent, in humans until brought to life by nuclear radiation. \nBecause Earth was such a peaceful place, attending medical casualties was rare and it was never a career that Kevin had the opportunity to explore. However, after humans discover two earth-like planets in Alpha Centauri and the aliens retaliate and attack Earth, casualties start rolling into the town the Faraday family lives in. Kevin is prepared since he was rapidly trained in the field of medicine on the insistence of his mother who recognized that there would not be enough people with the relevant medical knowledge to treat war casualties should the aliens attack. However, Kevin tries to run away at the first sight of a gaping wound. His mother forces him to stay, and he reluctantly begins shakily sponging the wound of a victim missing half of their face with water. He accidentally drops the sponge and plunges his fingers into the wound, disgusting him greatly. His mother notices immediately that Kevin has healed the wounds completely without scarring. This is the first discovery of Kevin\u2019s psi-power of healing, and he is the only person on Earth to have this ability. If it weren\u2019t for the aliens attacking Earth and creating many casualties, Kevin would not have discovered his extremely rare psi-power.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Kevin\u2019s long-undiscovered power is healing, which was largely useless in their society. The cure-all was invented before his birth and advanced technology meant illness, disease, and injuries were few and far between. If someone were injured or ill, they were taken to the health center in another town that contained a cure-all machine. This machine could cure anything within a few days. Frankly, his powers were not needed until the war came around. Since he did not grow up around physically hurt people, he was unable to discover his power until he placed his hands on an injured soldier. "

I\ndon't know why I say\n   \n   we\n   \n  \u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\n  \n \n  Exploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\n  \n \n  I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me.

Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\n  \n \n  I was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\n  \n \n  However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\n  \n<doc-sep>The blow shook the gun from my fingers.

        "Summary_1": "Kevin thinks he is one of the 5% of the population that does not have psi-powers, and we can learn a lot about how society sees this group of people by his interactions with his peers and his family. Before realizing he had powers, Kevin had to stay at home to take care of the house. His family knew that he would not be able to make much money in any kind of job without powers, and it would shame their family for him to be working one of those jobs. Even when he is at home, he's often referred to as slow or useless. He has never had many friends because his peers hated playing sports with him, since they couldn't communicate with their minds, and so Kevin was always at a disadvantage. Similarly, even though he was likeable, girls never wanted to date him. He was also left out of other aspects of society, because a lot of news was delivered via \"tellies\" which is received through psi-powers, so he often has to learn about the goings-on in the society from his family. Kevin learns firsthand how big of a difference it meant for how he was treated once he realized he did have powers after all.",
        "Summary_2": "People without psi powers are called psi-deficients or classified as psi-negative. They are unique in a society dominated by individuals who developed superpowers over time because of the proliferation of nuclear radiation in Earth's air. Such superpowers include telekinesis, prognostication, teleportation, and most prominently, telepathy. Almost every psi-powered individual has some amount of telepathic ability, and they can also protect themselves from interference by others with the same ability by using a mind shield. Psi-deficient individuals do not have any kind of superpower, so they are susceptible to the whims of those who do have such powers. For example, Kevin cannot read the minds or emotions of his family members, and he cannot protect his own mind or emotions from being probed by his mother and sister. Because of his lack of psi power, most of his family treats him with condescension. They tip-toe around his feelings and fail to really engage with him. Kevin does not feel loved or even liked by most of them, except his brother Tim, who offers him hope by suggesting he will discover his power sometime in the future. This is true for psi-deficients in general. They are viewed as \"throwbacks to an earlier era\" when disease and sickness crippled people in a disorderly society. Because psi-deficients have a harder time adjusting to this new society, they are seen as a kind of burden.",
        "Summary_3": "People without psi-powers are considered imbeciles and generally little use to society. Before Kev discovers his psi-power, he describes staying at home and \u201cwatching the house\u201d as his only real contribution to the family. People with psi-powers can do things so much more quickly and efficiently than those without, that people like Kev have little chance of holding jobs in this society.\nKevin describes how most psi-powers come with the ability to put up mental shields to stop the mind from being probed. Without psi-powers, the mind is completely transparent to mental probing by telepathy, meaning their thoughts are never private. \nThere are television-like telepathic projections in the society called \u201ctellies\u201d that can\u2019t be received by people without psi-powers, isolating them from current events like the discovery of the inhabited alien planets in Alpha Centauri. Kevin only learns about the discovery reported on the tellies from his siblings who have psi-powers.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Individuals who are born with psi-powers, only five percent of the general population, are truly looked down upon in this society. After radioactive testing and explosions brought out the latent psi-powers in people, society quickly changes to accommodate these superhumans. Therefore, those that don\u2019t fit into this society are outcasts, pitied, and often seen as failures by the rest of their family. Kevin is a perfect example. Before he discovered his powers, he was unable to work a menial job due to the shame it would bring his family. So, instead, he read books the primitive way, took walks around the park since he was unable to play sports thanks to his lack of psi-powers, and managed the machines that did all the housework. He truly served no purpose in society and felt great bitterness because of it. "

Like Kevin's other family members, Kevin's mother walks on eggshells around Kevin, never really truly engaging with him other than to remind the other children to not insult him for his deficiency. As a psychiatrist, his mother won't officially diagnose Kevin herself, but she wants him to make an appointment at the Psycho Center to help him because better adjusted to society. Kevin becomes emotionally disconnected from other people thanks to his own parents' emotional distance from him, and this lack of communication leads them to not understand each other very well. When Earth begins to anticipate war with the aliens from planets near Alpha Centauri, Kevin's mother orders him to train in first-aid in order to contribute. Since the world lacks hospitals because of the exponential decrease in sickness and disease, they have to turn the Psycho Center into a makeshift hospital. This is where Kevin discovers his power to heal people by touching them with his hands.

Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't think these are native?\"\n  \n \n  Ball said he didn't.

He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\n   \n   too\n   \n  old.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\n  \n \n  Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never can tell.

        "Summary_1": "Captain Steffens and his crew, including Lieutenant Ball, are exploring the dead (uninhabited) fourth planet of the star called Tybanon in the Coal Sack Nebula. They are on a Mapping Command sent from Earth to explore new planets, assess them for life-forms and evaluate the ability of human colonization.\nThis planet is peculiar because it contains stone building structures that are over 15,000 years old. Steffens and Ball discuss the profound realization that to be that old, the alien race that erected them must be quite advanced, with interstellar travel while humans were still throwing spears around. They conclude there were castaways stranded on the planet that were then evacuated since they could find no other traces of civilization besides the structures.\nThey begin mystery-solving, wondering if the race evacuated to a different planet. The readings from the system indicate that there are moons, and the Third planet has a suitable temperature range for life, but has a CO2 atmosphere. They take their ship down to cruising altitude on the Third planet and find cities that have all been obliterated into black craters at least three miles in diameter and very deep. They are shaken, and then Steffens spots the most perfect robots he has ever seen. They are black plastic, expertly crafted, have hanging arms and legs and move with a gliding motion. \nHe is forbidden by League Law from contacting planet-bound races. He is not clear if robots are a race (sentient robots are banned on Earth) and thinks that he could be in trouble whether he contacts them or not. Contacting them if they are a race would be bad, and also he would be dismissed for not fulfilling his mapping duties if they aren\u2019t a race. As he wonders, the robots contact the humans telepathically, urging them to land since their only desire is to serve and sending a visual of a robot extending a handshake.\nSteffens decides not to reach out to the Alien Contact branch, and makes contact and lands on the planet. The robots are disappointed when the humans land, but show examples of caring for them like cleaning up the radiation so that the humans can feel more comfortable, and spreading their robot bodies out across the planet because they themselves are radioactive.\nThe humans spend three weeks gathering knowledge of the planet. Steffens begins to inquire about their origins and finds they were constructed by \u201cMakers\u201d who are no longer on the planet, but that the robots believe will return. They were disappointed when the humans landed because they did not communicate telepathically and so could not be the makers. The robots also have Factories on the planet where they are constructed. The story ends with Steffens feeling an irony that he wishes to discover who made the robots, but asking them who their Makers are would be like asking a human who created their god - an impossible question.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Steffens, leader of the Mapping Command, led his crew to the Coal Sack Nebula and landed on Tyban IV. There, they discover the buildings left behind by an ancient civilization. Made out of native stone, the buildings were worn away by winds and times and were built on a raised rock. Lieutenant Ball and his geologists estimate that the rock was cut at least 15,000 years ago, 14,700 years before humans took to space. Ball and Steffens discuss the other planets in the Nebula, but none are fit to host human life. Still, they check each one out until they reach the hot one. This planet was radioactive and absolutely incapable of hosting life, however, as they got closer, Steffens could see a giant hole in the center. The site of an explosion, and all that remained was rubble. The image is up on the main screen for the whole crew to see, and they watch in amazement. Steffens sees movement in the rubble, and orders his crew to move the ship closer. He sees a black robot, and then two, as does the rest of his crew. Ball, who fell in the sudden movement, comes to Steffens, and they throw around ideas as to what these robots could be. Suddenly, a calm voice speaks to them telepathically, welcoming them to their planet and claiming they only wish to serve. A picture appeared then of a robot extending one of its hands. \nSteffens asks for permission to land, and so they do. He leaves the ship first, wearing his radiation suit, and is greeted by a large amount of slightly disappointed robots. He waves it off and soon the other members of his crew join them. Elb, the first robot to speak, explains their telepathic abilities and apologizes for violating their minds. They talk for a little while until Steffens asks where the Makers are. The robots answer sadly, saying that the Makers left a long time ago but would return. Steffens believes the Makers are dead, caught in the crossfire of the explosion, but he doesn\u2019t say so. The robots then showed his crew the Factory, which they reached by skiff. It was a large, gray building that pumped out robots left and right. \nThe Mapping Command stayed on this planet for several weeks, discovering more about this alien culture. However, the radioactive nature of the planet made it impossible for any man to stay outside the ship for long. However, one day, Steffens emerges to realize the robots effectivelyd econtaminated the area overnight. \nElb and Steffens discuss their meaning of life and what they were built to do. He realizes the Makers are like God to these robots, and he smiles at the irony. The story ends on a cliffhanger, however, claiming that that was the last time Steffens would smile on this planet. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Steffens and Lieutenant Ball find themselves in a very old city on a planet far from Earth, which was the first piece of proof humans had found of another advanced race in the three hundred years humans had been in space. There is something curious about the ruins of the old city built from stone, because the humans wouldn't have expected a colony to establish a presence there. They find another city on a nearby planet with a three-mile-wide scorch mark that looked like it had decimated the city. The men detect high levels of radiation, and know nothing alive is left. They decide to explore here as well, when Steffens spots a small black robot on the surface, which makes him jump the ship back up, opening up sight to a whole field of robots, which baffled the crew. They don't know if they are entirely mechanical, how long they'd been there, or where they came from. All of a sudden, the members of the crew hear the robots talking to them in a greeting, and then plant a moving picture in everyone's mind, which startles the crew. Steffens requests permission to land, and everyone realizes how many robots there really are. Steffens is surprised that the robots seem less interested in the humans once Steffans has gotten off of their ship, which makes everyone uncomfortable. The robots explain that the humans do not understand their real nature and wanted to inform them, and they promise not to intrude on thoughts anymore without consent. Steffens notices some symbols on the robot he had met, which look identical to the markings on the other robots, though he is unsure of their importance. The more he interacts with the robots, the more Steffans finds their presence likeable and comforting. Nobody is able to determine if the robots are entirely mechanical, or if there are organic components. The robots explain that they only other living structures they are familiar with are \"the Makers\" who created the robots. The Makers have not been present for a long time, making Steffens suspect that the robots had been involved in the war he had just seen evidence of. Steffens learns that the lifespan of the robots is about 55 years, but the robots are of various ages; they are built by \"the Factory\", which was built by the Makers. The humans stay for a few weeks, learning what they can, trading knowledge. Once the robots understand the point of the radiation suits, they decontaminate the area to make it safe for the humans, though they themselves remain radioactive. Elb, the lead robot, explains that the robots' main goal is to expand knowledge which will serve the Makers. The conversation gets tense as Elb recognizes that Steffens doesn't think the Makers are coming back, so they talk about society and faith.  Steffens explains the concept of God, which the robots find varies far more for humans than the idea of the Makers does for them.",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Steffens and his crew work for Mapping Command; their mission is to closely examine unexplored areas, check for life-forms, and determine whether sites are suitable for human habitation. They are currently exploring and recording information about the four planets of the star named Tyban in the Coal Sack Nebula. They find stone buildings still standing on the fourth planet but no signs of previous life. The smoothness of the stones leads them to conclude the buildings are approximately 15,000 years old. The men are amazed that space-borne beings were in this part of the Galaxy at the time when men on Earth were throwing spears at each other. They have numerous questions about the race, why there is no sign of them, and what happened to them. Lacking any way to answer these questions, they decide to move on.\n\tFlying over the fourth planet, the crew sees the remains of several cities, each destroyed by a blast that ruined the buildings. They see movement and realize it is a robot looking up at the ship; then they see more robots. At first, Steffens is undecided about what to do. League Law prohibits contact with planet-bound species, but these are robots, not living beings. Steffens decides they can legally interact with the robots, and then one of them communicates a message to him, greeting him and assuring him they do not mean any harm. It also sent a picture of one of the robots with its right arm extended for a handshake. Steffens senses the robot could control his mind if it wanted to and decides to communicate back, asking for permission to land.\n\tSteffens takes a skiff to the planet and is greeted by a robot holding out its hand for a handshake and welcoming him. Steffens signals the Aliencon men on the skiff to deplane and join him, and the robots reveal that they can read the humans\u2019 minds but are limiting their access to what is needed to communicate with them. Steffens signals his ship to land, and more robots come into view. The robots are friendly and pleasant, even relaxing to be around. They explain they had never encountered humans before, just themselves and their Makers who had lived there and created the factory that builds the robots. The robots were built to serve the Makers, and the factory is still producing them so that now there are nine million of them. \n\tElb, the robot who stays with Steffen, asks and answers questions and explains that the robots spend their time building their knowledge to be better able to serve their Makers when they return. Elb detects that Steffens thinks the Makers will not return and says they believe they will; otherwise, why were they built? Steffens compares their Makers to God because the robots believe the Makers created them, their planet, and the universe.\n"

He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship.

And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell.

The next planet they visited was hot and radioactive, absolutely unable to support any humanoid life form. However, when they got closer to the surface, Steffens and his crew noticed a giant hole in the center, charred and burnt. All the buildings within had perished in the explosion and nothing remained but a pile of rubble. The planet itself was hot and dry without any plants or wildlife.

The star Tyban is the \"sun\", so to speak, of the relevant planets, and the humans start their journey on the fourth planet of this system, standing in the ruins of a destroyed city that did not leave them many details to learn from. The third planet of the system, one in from the first one they were on, had more information for them. There was a city abandoned much like the one they had found on the fourth planet, but the huge scorch mark that covered the city made it look like its destruction had been very violent. On this third planet, there was no oxygen, a lot of heat, and it didn't seem like it would be able to support any kind of life, especially since it had high levels of radiation.

The fourth planet, Tyban IV, is only one parsec from Varius II and has 12 stone buildings with no airlocks, despite the thin atmosphere, or inscriptions\u2014any that were made would have presumably been removed by the winds blowing across the planet. The stones themselves have worn smooth, so based on the timeframe for wind erosion on Earth, Captain Steffens estimates the buildings might be 10 to 15 thousand years old. This discovery is significant because humans have been exploring space for 300 years, and this is the first sighting of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. The planet has a sandy surface and a blue-black mid-day sky. Of the other three planets, the inner is too hot for habitation and the outer too heavy and cold. \nThe third planet has a decent temperature range but a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The planet is surrounded by a layer of clouds and a misty gas; it is a heavy planet with no free oxygen, but there are several dead cities, each destroyed by a blast in the center, leaving a deep hole three miles wide and shattered, splintered walls. There is no vegetation, and the planet has lethal radiation levels that would prevent any life. The surface features rocky hills. This planet, however, has millions of active robots produced in a factory that is still operational. The robots have telepathic abilities and communicate with the people on the ship, inviting them to land. The robot factory was built by what the robots refer to as Makers, who have since left the planet and not returned.

This is evidenced by the disappointment the robots display when the humans land and the robots realize they do not communicate telepathically, thus cannot be the Makers they were expecting.\nSteffens states the \u201cironic parallel\u201d of the Makers at the end of the story because the humans wish to understand who created the robots, but they can\u2019t possibly answer that question because it would be like asking a human who created their god.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The \u201cMakers\u201d are humanoid aliens from over 15,000 years ago. They built the robots currently living on the radioactive wasteland to serve their every need. However, when their civilization was destroyed in the war, nothing remained of them aside from their robots. The robots idolize their Makers since they quite literally created them as well as the universe they exist in. Steffens draws the parallel between the robots\u2019 Makers and humans\u2019 God. He considers asking them who made the Makers, but then realizes that would be like asking who made God. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Makers were the race of people who had built the robots that the humans discover in the story. When the humans visit the planet, the robots are the only moving things on the surface: it seems that the Makers were likely destroyed in whatever radioactive explosion destroyed their city. The robots, when probing the minds of the humans, found the idea of the Maker to be the God of Earth, and tried to make connections between the two ideas. Much in the same way, the Maker of any sort had been responsible for building the creatures that lived to serve it. Unfortunately, given the evidence of some kind of war, the humans don't think the Makers are going to return to the planet they are visiting, which means that the robots will be working forever to serve the Makers who they will not see again; that is, they will never meet their makers. Even though their goals are based on self-improvement, they have no way of knowing if the main source of their motivation is even real anymore. It could also easily be confusing, if the humans asked where the Makers came from, because Steffens did not want to confuse the robots by asking them who the God of their own God was, so to speak. ",
        "Summary_4": "\n\tThe irony of the Makers is that they are the robots\u2019 God and parallel to the human concept of God. Just as human theology holds that God created the universe and humans, in the robots\u2019 understanding, the Makers created them, the planet, and the universe. There are other parallels as well; Christianity teaches that God dwelled among humans in his human form as Jesus. The Makers lived among the robots. Jesus was crucified and dead for three days until he returned to life and the people who knew him. Likewise, the Makers are gone, yet the robots fully expect them to return. Human theology teaches that God created humans to worship him and serve him; the Makers created the robots to serve them. In the absence of their Makers, the robots expectantly await their return just as Christians await the second coming of Jesus.\n\tFurthermore, the robots want to please their Makers and serve them the best they can. For this reason, in the Makers\u2019 absence, the robots have worked to improve themselves, learning what they can about natural science and mathematics. When Elb probes Steffens\u2019s mind to learn more about matter, his purpose is to enhance their knowledge. Likewise, humans seek to gain more knowledge about God and his teachings to serve God better.\n\tIt is also ironic that Steffens concludes that the Makers died in a war due to the ruined cities they discovered, but he doesn\u2019t want to harm the robots\u2019 faith in the return of their Makers. \n\t\n"

        "Summary_1": "The robots are the first evidence of an advanced alien race that man has discovered in 300 years of interstellar travel. They are at least a foot shorter than the humans, with an eye-band circling their entire head, bunches of hanging arms, and a gliding type of locomotion. Steffens remarks that they are some of the most well-built machinery he has ever seen. The robots are made of black plastic, and have rows of dense symbols engraved all over their torsos. Their communication comes to the humans telepathically, and they are fully sentient - aware of their life spans of ~55 years, and their time until death. They also have the ability to probe the minds of the humans and even urge them to make certain decisions, but they reveal they only use this to get the humans to land and will not use it further except when given permission.\nThey claim to have been made by the Makers, and exhibit the Factory where they are built to Steffens and his crew while they are on the Third planet. There are more than nine million of them in total on the planet, which astonishes the humans, and they spend their time trying to expand their knowledge to better serve their Makers when they eventually return to the planet. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The robots are short, black hunks of metal with several arms and legs each. They have a plastic band that circles their head, allowing them to see in every direction. They have a series of symbols that decorate the fronts of their bodies. They are telepathic robots, able to both see into the minds of others as well as communicate with them both in their language and through visual elements. They are, as is often said, built to serve, and they live in a sort of purgatory waiting for their Makers to return home. There are approximately nine million robots currently living on that planet, each with a life span of around 55 years. They are made in the Factory, which was, of course, built by the Makers. There are two types of robots: the normal ones met by Steffens and Ball, as well as the Doctors who are able to heal flesh. ",
        "Summary_3": "The robots that Steffens spots on the third planet of the star Tyban are small and black with a vision band wrapping around the top, the rest created from black metal, with a number of sturdy legs that put them about a foot shorter than the humans. They have the ability to make the humans on the ship hear thoughts that they relay to them, and can even send images this way, which makes Steffens worry that they have mind-control abilities. They do have the ability to intrude on thoughts. It is clear to Steffens that they were built to serve those around them, and at the initial encounter they do insist that their \"only desire is to serve\". Those that they want to serve are \"the Makers\", presumably the race of people who were on the planet before the city was scorched and destroyed in some kind of radioactive explosion. It is not clear what the robots' role in this part of the history is, just that the chances of their makers coming back to them was probably very low. ",
        "Summary_4": "The robots were designed by their Makers and produced in their factories which are still operational as there are over nine million of them of various ages and remaining lifespans. They are small, black structures with several hanging arms and legs. They have a band of transparent plastic-like material that runs around their heads; this is presumably their eye, enabling them to see in all directions. A similar round dot of the plastic on top of their heads suggests they can see directly over them. The robots are all identical and have rows of symbols on their torsos. Surprisingly, the robots appear to demonstrate emotion as they seem disappointed when they first meet Steffens, pleased when the ship lands and the crew joins them on the planet, pained when they refer to their Makers who have been gone a long time, and curious about the similarities and differences between themselves and the humans.\nCommunicating telepathically, the robots let Steffens and his crew know that they are designed to serve. It is possible that the robots can control human minds, but they choose not to do so. They let Steffens know that they only reached out to the humans\u2019 minds because they detected that the humans were going to leave, so they decided to communicate some information about themselves so that the humans would stay for a visit. They also indicate that they explored the humans\u2019 minds only enough to be able to contact and communicate with them. The robots understand human thinking: they know how to present themselves as nonthreatening, sending an image of one with an outstretched arm for a handshake and reducing the number of robots that first engage with the humans, so they won\u2019t be overwhelmed or intimidated. They also understand that their silence will draw the humans in after their initial communication and the picture, due to their curiosity. \nLeft to their own devices after their Makers left and didn\u2019t return, the robots engaged in building their knowledge of the natural sciences and mathematics. Their goal is to make themselves even more useful to their Makers when they return. The robots fully expect their Makers to return; otherwise, what would be their purpose?\n"

Steffens felt a deep chill.\n  \n \n  Were they immortal?\n  \n<doc-sep>Steffens had not realized that there were so many.\n  \n \n  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What do you\n   \n   do\n   \n  ?\" Steffens asked.\n  \n \n  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n  \n \n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Steffens was stumped as to what to do when they visually discovered robots on the Third planet. He proactively sounded an alert and put defense screens on the ship, but wondered about what his governing League Law would have him do.\nContact with races on foreign planets was forbidden, but he was unsure if robots could be called a race. Earth didn\u2019t have robots because imaginative robots were expressly forbidden to build. Steffens thought it was possible the robots were the brains of natives encased in metal.\nSince Steffens is under \u201cThe Mapping Command\u201d, he is supposed to go no further than examining unexplored systems, checking for life-forms and the possibilities of human colonization. His conundrum was that,  \u201cif he returned to Sirius base without investigating this robot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the other, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty.\u201d\nThe robots reach out telepathically, saying in words that they are only here to serve, and communicating a photo to the minds of the crew of a robot extending a hand for a handshake. Although Steffens wonders about letting the Alien Contact crew handle the situation, he ultimately decides it is his responsibility - and he goes on to initiate contact by requesting to land. He is encouraged to stay and explore by the kind nature of the robots.\n",
        "Summary_2": "When Steffens and his crew flew from Tyban IV to check out this other planet, they had no idea that they would find life or even robotic humanoids on this planet. The Mapping Command is simply meant to check off boxes (was there life on this planet? Is it inhabitable for humans?), not to interact with the potential life forms below. However, Steffens is faced with a serious dilemma when he encounters the robots. He has already technically made contact by accident since he flew so close to the surface to investigate the burnt city. Whether or not he interacted with them more or flew away, he would be in trouble with the Commissioner. Contact with races is expressly forbidden, however, he wonders if robots could really be defined as a race since they were more of an invention. So, he decided to learn more about the robots by staying. ",
        "Summary_3": "At first, Steffens isn't sure if he should engage with the robots because the League Law forbids contact with planet-bound races, but the robots were not necessarily a race. Because Earthmen did not have robots, they were a new type of encounter for him, and he decided that it would be okay since they had effectively already made contact. He isn't even sure if they are native beings with some kind of casing to protect their organs or even just brains from the elements, or if they are entirely robots. In the end, though, it was a Catch-22: if he made contact, he could be breaking the Law of Contact, but if he went back to base without making contact, it could be said that he did not complete his duty. ",
        "Summary_4": "Steffens decides to engage with the robots because they seem to be openly and graciously inviting the spaceship and its men to visit them. The robots send a friendly greeting, explaining that they do not wish the humans harm and that their only desire is to serve. They also send an image of one of the robots lifting its arm and graciously offering its hand. In addition, since the robots communicate with the humans telepathically, their messages are persuasive, and Steffens feels a strong urge to take the robot\u2019s proffered hand. Another reason he decides to engage with the robots is that while the Law of Contact forbids making contact with life-forms, the robots are not life-forms, and Steffens could very well face a court-martial for dereliction of duty if he does not make contact with them. On top of that, Steffens is immensely curious about the robots and their makers."

        "Query": "What is the storyline of A CITY NEAR CENTAURUS?",
        "Article": "Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space\nship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They\nwere the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he\nrealized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown\nof concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.\n  \n \n  On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward\nthem.\n  \n \n  She said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her\nstomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared\nafter her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice.\n  \n \n  He let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like\nhe was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled\nafter the girl. \"What's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I\ndidn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which\nleads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach\nthe hills we'll be safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was\nwrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head\nforemost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom,\nwinced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the\nhills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.\n  \n \n  \"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted.\n  \n \n  \"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could\nget around in the hills.\"\n  \n \n  The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a\ngorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon\nof sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the\ncrevices and floor of the canyon.\n  \n \n  They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped\naway, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her\narm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied\nit to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded\nhim. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year\n3372; not the time of ancient Greece.\n  \n \n  The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more\nprecipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the\nuniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.\n\"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette\npackage, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope.\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we\nwere here.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the\nfreighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her\ngrip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship.\nI don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley\ntobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on\nGanymede.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly\ndetached her hand.\n  \n \n  The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.\n\"We are going to the camp,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from\nunder her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.\n  \n \n  A voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who\nreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they\nhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly\nlike the neighing of horses.\n  \n \n  Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem\nof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred\nto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's\nmoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to\nthe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty\ntimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.\n  \n \n  At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults\nback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls\nresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.\nThe brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome\nfellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.\n  \n \n  They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep\nvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees\nalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of\nthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.\n  \n \n  They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind\na promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming\nordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew\nthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp\nlike a bag of meal.\n  \n \n  The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner\nreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded\nand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded\nhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He\nlooked away hastily.\n  \n \n  Someone hailed them from the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors.\n  \n \n  A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She\nhad green eyes. \"We're rescued!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus.\n  \n \n  \"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could\nlook so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered\nlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt\nlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.\n  \n \n  A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,\n\"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of\nthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him\nappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him\ninto the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\"\n  \n \n  He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the\nwrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of\nthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His\nfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the\nThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang\nforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be\nseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like\na captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar\nsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan\nFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild\nwomen.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Stationed on the Earth base of Alpha Centaurus II, Mr. Michaelson, a tall, gaunt archeologist, explores the planet for historical artifacts. He is human, but has a special cylinder embedded in the flesh behind his ear that teleports him to a different location when touched.\nHe comes across an empty city in the desert, with the old buildings filling with blown sand, though he is not alone. He is approached by a short, gray-haired native with webbed bare feet (aka webfoot or Maota) that he spotted in a doorway, who introduces himself as the keeper of the city and implores him to leave because he angers the gods. Michaelson brushes aside that spirits exist, but notes that he must keep an eye on this intelligent native.\nAs Michaelson continues to explore the city and disobey what he was told, the native again demands he leave, calling him \u201cMr. Earthgod.\u201d Michaelson learns his name is Maota, and tries to negotiate to preserve the artifacts and build a museum. Maota does not succumb to Michaelson\u2019s tactics, and whacks him unconscious with a metal book.\nMichaelson awakes and teleports to a creek 500 miles away to clean his wound, then returns and opens the book to find voices talking to him. He is mystified that the civilization here said to have disappeared half a million years ago was communicating with him. In his wonder, he picks up another clock-like artifact he has been curious about, and is shocked to feel it is radiating heat.\nThe next day, Michaelson awakes in the dead city to find Maota pointing a gun-like weapon at him - apologizing for causing him pain instead of killing him. Maota reads from the talking poetry book, at Michaelson\u2019s request. It moves them both, Michaelson feeling the humanity of the civilization, and Maota feeling the gentle spirits. Maota becomes furious that Michaelson wants to move things into a museum and begins to fire the weapon. Michaelson teleports behind him and in their struggle to take possession they discharge it - destroying the book. \nMaota has disgraced himself and the gods and becomes inconsolable. He has been wanting to try the \u201cclock\u201d device for some time - now with renewed determination because he doesn\u2019t care if it kills him. He explains that he thinks the race of the dead city entered a fourth dimension. Pushing the button, Maota\u2019s body collapses in death. Michaelson tries to bury him, but has the sense that his soul is elsewhere. Michaelson desperately studies the artifacts to understand the clock, then radically decides to just press the button too. Afterwards, he sees his dead body below him and communicates with Maota\u2019s consciousness in a spiritual dimension. He discovers that he can will his cylinder with his mind to return to his physical body, traversing between the physical and spiritual realms.

He notices an older, webfooted man watching him as he explores the ancient city. The older man, named Maota, tells Michaelson that he is trespassing in the city, which is sacred ground where the spirits may one day return. Maota identifies himself as the city's keeper and warns Michaelson that he is angering the gods. Still, Michaelson pays him little attention because he is so wrapped up in his discovery. Maota warns Michaelson to leave or be killed, but Michaelson continues to ignore Maota and collect and inspect artifacts.\n\tMichaelson talks about building a museum there, showcasing the artifacts, and inviting people to come and see everything. Extremely angry and frustrated, Maota throws one of the ancient books at Michaelson, knocking him out. Later, Michaelson studies the book, opening it and running his finger over the writing, which creates the sound of a voice\u2014the book talks! Inside a tall building, Michaelson observes a clock-like object, touching it and discovering it is warm and vibrating. Amazingly, the device is still operating.\n\tMaota returns in the morning, apologizes for hitting Michaelson, saying he should have killed him. He has brought a weapon with him. Michaelson asks Maota to read to him from the book before he kills him, and Maota agrees, telling Michaelson that it is a book of poetry. Michaelson dismisses the book as unimportant, wondering why the ancient ones didn\u2019t leave books about history or mathematics instead, but he wants to hear it read and asks Maota to read some to him. Then, Maota prepares to shoot Michaelson, but Michaelson uses his cylinder to jump behind Maota before he fires. The two wrestle over the weapon, and it fires a shot into the sand near the book. Together they dig through the sand to find the book, but it is gone. Finally, Maota says he is giving up and going away but not leaving the city. Michaelson is perplexed by the paradoxical statement, but Maota says he doesn\u2019t know enough to explain it. However, he tells Michaelson that he has read the ancient race\u2019s books and knows they conquered all diseases, explored all the mysteries of science, and devised the clock-type machine to cheat death. \n\tMaota presses the button on the clock machine, and it makes noises. Then Maota\u2019s knees buckle, and he is dead. Michaelson buries the body and continues his study of the city, learning the language and reading the books. Then he decides to use the clock device to see what it does. His body collapses, but his mind joins Maota\u2019s. Sad to see his body, Michaelson touches it and feels a vibration of life.

        "Summary_3": "Mr. Michaelson is an archeologist from Earth who visits the ruins of an unnamed, 500,000-year-old city on Alpha Centaurus II. He uses an implant behind his ear to transport himself there instantaneously, and he excitedly explores the sand-covered streets and complex varieties of buildings he discovers. Soon after his arrival, he encounters an old man he quickly identifies as one of the webfooted natives. As he continues exploring, the native man approaches him and orders him to leave since Mr. Michaelson is trespassing on sacred ground and making the spirits angry. Mr. Michaelson refuses, and the native man threatens to kill him if he does not leave. As night falls, Michaelson continues to uncover artifacts left behind by the city\u2019s disappeared inhabitants. The native man returns to ask why Michaelson has not left as instructed, and he introduces himself as Maota; Maota believes Michaelson is a god because of his fascination with the city and its artifacts. Michaelson tries to recruit Maota into helping him preserve the city for posterity, but Maota refuses. Instead, he hits Michaelson in the head with an ancient book he is carrying. When Michaelson awakens, he uses his implant to beam to a small creek where he cleans his wound. When he returns, he discovers the book Maota had used to hit him. He believes he hears the book speaking to him in a strange language. Startled, he returns to a clock-like device he had seen earlier. When he touches the clock, he finds it warm, which frightens him. Michaelson leaves the building and falls asleep. When he awakens later, he finds Maota standing over him, who informs him the book is full of ancient poetry and then says he will kill Michaelson for not leaving the city. Michael asks Maota to read to him from the book before he dies, and Maota obliges. When the book's pages begin to blow in the wind, Maota takes this as proof of the existence of spirits. When Michaelson mocks Maota again, Maota rages and points his gun at him. Michaelson uses his implant to appear behind Maota; the two struggle for control of the gun. They accidentally shoot the book into oblivion. Because of Michaelson's implant, Maota once again believes he is a god, but Michaelson explains to him that it is artificial. Convinced that Michaelson is only human, Maota announces that he is going away, and he offers to show Michaelson how. Maota reveals that the ancient race had not died out; instead, they had used the clock-like device to transfer themselves to a kind of fourth dimension, where they could observe and communicate outside the constraints of a physical body. Maota triggers the device, and his body slumps over. Michaelson buries him and later triggers the device too, finding himself reunited with Maota in the fourth dimension. However, unlike Maota, Michaelson discovers he is able to zoom between dimensions thanks to his implant, which convinces Maota that Michaelson is a devil rather than a god.",

He is soon stopped by the webfoot, who explains that Michaelson must leave immediately lest he anger the spirits. He introduces himself as keeper of the city which Michaelson finds amusing. Maota believes that the city must remain untouched so the spirits would not be lost in the darkness. He tells Michaelson to leave quickly or else he will be killed. Michaelson does not leave but continues exploring. His cylinder, a contraption worn above the ear, could transport him back home in a heartbeat, but he decides not to use it yet.

A clock-like object is particularly fascinating, especially after Michaelson touches it to find it warm and vibrating\u2014meaning that it is still operational. Many of the structures and objects are made of metal which has helped preserve them for such a long time. The book that Maota throws are Michaelson has metal pages and, surprisingly, speaks when Michaelson runs his fingers along the lines of text. \n\tHumans at this time have advanced technology for travel. They have invented personalized devices in the shape of a cylinder implanted behind a person's ear. With this device, the person can think of a place he wants to travel to, and the device instantly whisks him there. \n",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place in an old city on Alpha Centaurus II. Not much is revealed about the planet itself except for the fact that it has a small population of webfooted humanoids who are not actually natives but come from a colony from the fifth planet of the system. They are curious and many are quite intelligent, including Maota, whom Michaelson meets when he arrives in the city. White clouds float in a pale blue sky, and at night silver moonlight from the two moons illuminates the ruins. Five hundred miles from the city is a small creek where Michaelson washes his head wound. The city itself is covered in sand and desert plants after hundreds of thousands of years of disuse. However, the buildings remain intact and include a complex variety of small homes, spire-topped, square, ellipsoid, and spheroid buildings. There are also conical towers with beautiful bridges connecting them. The ruins of the city are well-preserved and include a large number of fascinating archeological artifacts including bowls, metal, a small statue of a man, ancient books (including Maota's favorite book of poetry), and a clock-like device that can transport a person to another dimension. Just outside of the city is a sandy hill, where Michaelson eventually buries Maota's body. The final setting of the story is the fourth dimension where Maota and Michaelson transfer their spirits using the clock device. This dimension is characterized by utter silence and darkness. The only presence there is awareness and memory.",
        "Summary_4": "A City Near Centaurus by Bill Doede takes place on the planet Alpha Centaurus II sometime in the future. Mr. Michaelson comes across the ruins of an ancient city and walks through the sand-covered streets to discover more. Tall spires cast shadows across the roads, while wild plants grow out of the roofs of small buildings. Two moons shine light down on Alpha Centaurus II partially lighting up the night. Soaring towers are connected by swaying bridges, and smaller buildings clearly used to be houses. Each building has a slightly different shape whether that be spherical or square. The infrastructure is built of dark metal impervious to rust and general wear. The buildings themselves are full of various artifacts: talking books, transporting clocks, and silver bowls. "

Michaelson is also convinced that his views are right and that anyone else\u2019s are wrong. For example, he is impressed with the talking book until he learns that it is a book of poetry; then, he considers it a waste. He believes books about mathematics or history are much more valuable. On the other hand, he is eager to hear Maota read the book, and the sounds of the words, even though he cannot understand them, move him and remind him the lost people were human with human sentiments and passions. When Maota decides to leave but indicates he is going in a direction Michaelson doesn\u2019t know, Michaelson calls him stupid outright.

He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet.

Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back.

Wind moved the pages.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n  \n \n  \"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\n  \n \n  Michaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\n  \n \n  He dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\n  \n \n  They struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums.

We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\n  \n \n  Michaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\n  \n \n  At first he thought it didn't work.

        "Summary_1": "The webfoot, real name Maota (also referred to as \u201cthe native\u201d by Mr. Michaelson), is the self-proclaimed keeper of the dead city on Alpha Centaurus II. He is an older man of at least sixty or seventy years, short in stature with long gray hair to his shoulders. The toes of his webbed, bare feet drag in the sand as he walks making a trail behind him.  \nMaota is sturdy in his beliefs that the dead city needs to be protected, and that the gods are being disrupted by Mr. Michaelson. He feels strongly enough about it that he resorts to physical violence on two occasions - hitting Mr. Michaelson with a book over the head, and firing a gun-like weapon at him. Although he is angry and violent with Mr. Michaelson, he also shows remarkable tolerance for him. \nMaota\u2019s ultimate duty, he believes, is to the gods. This brings him turmoil when he thinks he missed the chance the gods gave him to kill Mr. Michaelson, and even apologized to him directly for instead letting him suffer with a head wound instead of killing him. There is a reference to them perhaps having met before when Michaelson says tauntingly to Maota, \u201cYou never told us about this old dead city\u2026 Shame on you. But never mind.

        "Summary_2": "The webfoot is named Maota, and he is the guardian of the ancient dead city on Alpha Centaurus II. His people are not natives of the planet but originated from a colony from the system's fifth planet. These people are curious and sometimes highly intelligent, although they are not educated. Maota himself is an older man, perhaps sixty or seventy years old, short with long gray hair. He wears no shoes, and his toes drag in the sand as he walks. Maota is upset when he finds Michaelson trespassing in the dead city and urgently informs him that he is on sacred ground and must leave. Maota tells Michaelson that the spirits are angry that he is there and indicates the spirits might return; that is why he guards the city. When Michaelson pays no heed to the order to leave, Maota grows angry, warning Michaelson that even his steps or breath may be detrimental to the spirits and he must leave now or be killed. When his warning falls on deaf ears, Maota resorts to flattery, saying that it takes a sensitive god to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in the old street, thus implying that Michaelson is not only a god but one with the sensitivity required to detect the history and spirits of the place. \nHowever, when Michaelson tells Maota his plan to build a museum and display everything for others to come and see, Maota loses his temper and throws one of the ancient books at Michaelson, hitting him in the back of the head and knocking him unconscious. After Michaelson stays in the city overnight, Maota approaches him with a weapon, intent on killing him. Maota believes he has reasoned logically with Michaelson and given him enough warnings that he should have left; he isn\u2019t interested in negotiating with Michaelson because the only satisfactory outcome is for Michaelson to leave and never come back. He is prepared to kill Michaelson with his tube gun. Maota is willing to entertain Michaelson\u2019s last request, which is for Maota to read to him from the book. He does, but he still insists Michaelson must die. The city must be preserved for the spirits, not a show for people who may not appreciate it or the spirits. Maota\u2019s great sensitivity and reverence for the spirits lead to his great despair when the book of poetry is destroyed. When he is unsuccessful at driving Michaelson away, he chooses the last resort\u2014using the device that kills his human body but allows his mind to live on.\n",

Although they make their home on Alpha Centaurus II, the webfooted people are originally from a colony on the fifth planet in the system. Michaelson wonders why Maota is so far from his people when they first meet. Maota stays in the city because he believes strongly in the presence of spirits, and he spends his days roaming the streets feeling their presence and reading an ancient book of poetry. Maota bemoans Michaelson's presence because he believes his interest in preserving the city for posterity disturbs the spirits and would potentially violate the beauty and magic of the city. Because of Michaelson's teleportation implant, Maota believes Michaelson is a god, and so he feels he must kill Michaelson if he will not leave because mortals cannot negotiate wit\nh gods. Once Michaelson convinces Maota he is just a human, Maota feels disappointed because he had hoped Michaelson would join him in his practice of thinking the ancient thoughts. As such, Maota leads Michaelson to a room where he keeps a clock-like device that he triggers. Then, Maota appears to die. In actuality, his spirit has been transferred to another dimension. When Michaelson joins him there and demonstrates how he can zoom in between dimensions using his implant, Maota starts to believe Michaelson is a devil.",

He takes his self-assigned role as keeper of the city very seriously and will act violently if need be. Maota is very spiritual, shown through his belief that tampering with the city will upset the spirits should they choose to return home. Although he is somewhat patient with Michaelson at first, he chooses his duty over Michaelson\u2019s curiosity. He attempts to kill him twice but to no avail, which shows his true dedication to the city.

He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\n  \n \n  He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\n  \n \n  Michaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n  \n \n  \"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\n  \n \n  Michaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\n  \n \n  Maota pointed to it.\n  \n \n  \"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The cylinder is an implement tailored to Mr. Michaelson that is tucked behind his ear and will allow him to go anywhere that he desires when it is pressed. He uses it several times in the story to travel to physical places, disappearing immediately and reappearing in a new location. Once, to travel to a cold stream to wash his bleeding wounds after being hit on the head with a book by Maota, and a second time to avoid being killed by Maota firing a weapon to kill him.\nAfter Maota presses the button of the \u201cclock\u201d in the dead city and appears to drop dead. Mr. Michaelson desperately attempts to gain the knowledge to understand what the clock device does. Rather radically, he decides that he must press the button to fully understand, not completely knowing that he won\u2019t die when he does. When Mr. Michaelson sees his dead body below him in the city and communicates wordlessly with Maota in this spiritual dimension he begins to panic and search for ways to get back into his body. This is how he discovers that he can will the cylinder with his mind, and return into his physical body by doing so. Through this act he can traverse between the physical and spiritual realms, which ultimately makes him considered a god by Maota (greatly angering him).\n",
        "Summary_2": "The cylinder is a small device inserted under the flesh behind Michaelson\u2019s ear and transports him to other locations instantly, operated by his thoughts. Each cylinder is tailored to the person for whom it is intended and will not work for anyone else. It instantly sends him 500 miles across the desert to a creek where he can wash and cool off after his head injury. The cylinder saves his life twice: first in the fight with Maota when Maota points the tube gun at him. Michaelson uses the cylinder to jump out of Maota\u2019s line of sight and land behind him. The second time it saves his life is when he uses the clock device. Michaelson\u2019s lifeless body is left behind as his mind journey\u2019s to where Maota\u2019s is, a place from which there is no return. However, Michaelson remembers the cylinder and tries to use it to return to his body, and it works. The cylinder, not the clock device, actually sent him to where Maota\u2019s mind went.  \n",
        "Summary_3": "The cylinder is a small, artificial implant that Mr. Michaelson receives behind his ear. The implant allows him to travel any distance, great or small, instantaneously and is triggered by a thought. The implant enables Michaelson to travel from Earth to Alpha Centaurus II, and he uses the implant again to locate the old city that he explores on foot. After Maota injures Michaelson with the poetry book, he uses the implant to transport himself to a small creek where he washes away the caked blood from his hair.  Later, Michaelson again triggers the implant to avoid being shot by Maota when he attempts to kill him. Maota indicates he believes Michaelson is a god because of his ability to travel any distance in the blink of an eye. When Maota demonstrates the power of the clock-like device to transfer a person's spirit to another dimension, Michaelson realizes he maintains a connection to his corporeal body via the cylindrical implant. He uses this realization to his advantage by triggering the implant, which allows him to go back and forth between the fourth dimension and his corporeal form.",
        "Summary_4": "The cylinder is an innovative invention shared among Earthmen. It allows the person wearing it to travel between places in the blink of an eye. Michaelson wears his cylinder above the ear, and it is specifically tailored to his being. This device becomes incredibly important in the story as Michaelson uses it several times throughout his time in the ancient ruins. The first instance of significance was when Maota attempted to kill Michaelson with his weapon, but Michaelson simply disappeared in front of his eyes, only to reappear behind him and knock him out with a well-timed blow. The cylinder saved his life then and elevated him to god-like status in Maota\u2019s eyes. \nAfter Maota travels through the mysterious clock and presumably dies, Michaelson spends several weeks deciding what to do. When he finally hits the button, his body also falls, just like Maota\u2019s, and he regains consciousness in a spirit world where he can see everything on any planet he wants. Maota tells him that no one is able to leave, no matter how hard they try, and that they are stuck in this plane of existence. Michaelson, however, is able to use his cylinder to travel out of that dimension and back onto the planet. He does it again to prove that it truly works, leaving Maota crying out in anger. \n"

And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been\ninherently poor.\n  \n \n  Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But men\nhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that\nhad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.\n  \n \n  Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been\nwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round\ntrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.\n  \n \n  But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government\nand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled\nto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by\nspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien\nconditions.\n  \n \n  On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to\nwhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.\nThat one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with\ncolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.\n  \n \n  Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the\nexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,\nhe had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus\nColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form\nwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to study\nnative Venusian materials.\n  \n \n  Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n  \n \n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n  \n \n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n  \n \n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n  \n \n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n  \n \n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n  \n \n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n  \n \n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n  \n \n  Then it was done.\n  \n \n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You see?\"\n  \n \n  Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\nothers in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\ntheir own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n  \n \n  The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n  \n \n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n   \n   They\n   \n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n  \n \n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n  \n \n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Engineer Barry Barr is one of the chosen few to ride on Number Three to Venus. His beloved Dorothy Voorhees would have been riding with him, but Barry had a piece of scaffolding drop on his ankle. Unable to make the first flight, Barry hops onto Number Four instead. \nOn the journey to Venus, a small meteor crashes into their hull at several hundreds of miles an hour. The effect is immediate: Ryan is killed in the jet room and traces of the meteor are stuck in the field. Barry wakes up when the alarm bells are sounded, and rushes to join the rest of the crew to figure out what\u2019s going on. Nick Podtaguine is steering the ship with emergency controls while Captain Reno looks on. Once the jet room stabilized, Captain Reno opens the doors to find Ryan\u2019s body and ruin. After fixing all that they could, Reno hit the accelerator, only to watch in dismay at it soared out of proportions. Captain Reno cut off the power, realizing that the meteor had left metal particles in the cylinder of force. He asks for volunteers to work outside of the ship and remove all traces of the meteor. No one volunteers at first because of how dangerous a task it is; Sigma radiation affects man in ways still unknown and incurable. After Robson Hind turns the task down, Barry volunteers. He steps outside in his spacesuit equipped to block radiation and removes them with the chisel. \nOnce he returns inside, he falls asleep and wakes a day later already feeling the effects of the radiation. His symptoms only increase: dryness, heat, and breathing difficulties. He faints upon standing and realizes that the Sigma radiation had seeped into his spacesuit. \nFour heads toward Venus while Barry suffers from an insatiable thirst. Finally, upon landing, they throw open the doors to let in the muggy Venusian air, and Barry feels like he can breathe again. Two and Three welcome them, and Barry throws his arms around Dorothy before fainting. Dr. Carl Jensen gives him water which Barry inhales. He\u2019s growing gills on the sides of his neck, and dry air is becoming more intolerable. \nBarry asks Nick to build him a machine to let in moisture, allowing him to breathe better. He grows webbed fingers and toes. Dorothy doesn\u2019t visit him while in hospital until she can\u2019t bear it anymore. She bursts open the door and reveals she still loves him even though he has a wife and family back in Philadelphia. Barry reveals the falsehood and believes that Hind sent her a letter detailing this lie. One night, he wakes up to realize his moisture machine was broken and the door locked. He escapes by breaking the window and runs to the water. He dives in and inhales the water. Worms attack him, but he swims away to the ocean. He battles humanoid Venusians and kills one of them. He rescues a girl from being robbed. \n",
        "Summary_2": "People are settling Venus, and those aboard ship Four have a close call when the ship is struck by a meteorite that damages the accelerators and leaves metal in a shaft. After the accelerator is repaired under the leadership of Robson Hind, they discover the metal. Barry Barr volunteers to do the spacewalk to remove the metal that is wedged in the shaft since he is unassigned on this voyage. Assigned members are considered unexpendable, so they are expected to stay and protect the ship. The spacewalk is dangerous due to the high concentration of deadly Sigma outside. Although their spacesuits have Kendall shields, no one knows how effective they are. Animals briefly exposed to Sigma die almost right away. Barr completes the work and returns to a hero\u2019s welcome. \n\tSoon, Barr begins feeling strange. He\u2019s ravenously hungry, extremely thirsty, and having difficulty breathing. He tries to eat, but the sense that the air is extraordinarily hot and dry makes it harder for him to breathe, and he passes out. However, when the ship reaches Venus, Barr breathes in the hot, humid air, and his breathing becomes much less labored. Feeling stronger, he seeks out the woman he loves, Dorothy Voorhees, who arrived at the colony on Three. They kiss, but then he passes out again, and when he wakes, Barr asks for water which he pours into his lungs. The doctor tells him that would normally kill a person. Barr scratches his neck and notices something growing there, which the doctor identifies as the beginnings of gills.\n\tBarr asks his friend to gather materials and build him a humidifier in the infirmary. With this device, Barr can breathe better. Barr longs to see Dorothy, especially since he knows Robson Hind is probably wooing her; the two men have been competing for her affections. At last, Dorothy comes to see him, claiming she loves him and can\u2019t stay away even though he is married and has a child. Barr isn\u2019t married and suspects that Hind planted the story to win Dorothy for himself. Later that night, Barr awakens, unable to breathe. An investigation shows that his humidifier\u2019s water and power lines have been cut, and the door to his room is locked from the outside. Barr knocks out the window with a chair, runs outside, and dives into the slough. There, at last, he can breathe. He realizes that he has become a water breather, meaning he is no longer completely human. He stays in the slough until some worms start biting his eyelids, then makes his way to the ocean. He wants to stay close to the colony even though he can\u2019t breathe on land anymore, but suddenly a group of human-like creatures with webbed fingers and toes like his descend on him and begin attacking with their spears and tube weapons. He kills one but sees two other males capture a female, and Barr attacks her attackers.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Barry Barr is a structural engineer serving on Number Four, a ship taking part in the Five Ship Plan headed for Venus. The Five Ship Plan had been designed to avoid filling one ship to critical mass with fuel; instead, five ships would fill their tanks as much as safely possible, land on Venus, and the ship that had sustained the least amount of damage would take on the fuel reserves of the other four for the return trip to Earth unless a successful colony could be established on Venus. Barry had originally been assigned to Number Three, but an ankle injury caused him to take the later ship. A meteorite strikes Number Four, and since Barry is unassigned and therefore expendable, he goes outside the ship to remove the debris in spite of the dangerous presence of Sigma radiation, which had been known to kill animals. As he is outside, he thinks about Dorothy Voorhees, a toxicologist on Number Three with whom Barry is in love. The wealthy jet chief Robson Hind is also in love with Dorothy, although Dorothy only has a shallow interest in what he has to offer. Barry's spacesuit offers minimal protection against the radiation, and when he returns, he discovers he has indeed developed a kind of sickness that causes him to struggle to breathe in the ship's air. When Number Four finally lands on Venus, Barry is surprised to discover he can breathe much easier in the thick, humid atmosphere there. As Number Four reconnects with the makeshift colony the previous ships have constructed, Barry is reunited with Dorothy briefly before passing out. Dr. Carl Jensen examines Barry and keeps him on bed rest for several days. When Barry awakens, he recruits his friend Nick to help him fashion a machine that will transfer the Venusian atmosphere into his room so that he may breathe easier. Dr. Jensen is shocked at the physical changes in Barry; over time, he grows gills and webbed feet. Finally, Dorothy visits him in his room and reveals her true love for him; she had been hesitant to do so because she had received a communication from his wife in Philadelphia revealing Barry was married with a child. This news surprises Barry since he is not married; Robson must have written the letter to drive a wedge between him and Dorothy. When Barry awakens the next day, he discovers his door is locked and the machine drawing Venusian air into his room has been shut off. Desperate to breathe, Barry breaks out of his room and jumps into the nearby slough, where he is attacked by hundreds of hostile worms. He swims further out into an ocean, amazed by his ability to breathe underwater. Underwater, Barry runs into two Venusians who attack him and a female Venusian. Barry helps her and saves himself by fighting off the attackers.",
        "Summary_4": "The spaceship Number Four is in free fall; its crew is doing everything they can to get it working again. As they tend to various systems, the outside threat is brought to the reader's attention: Sigma radiation, which is not well understood by humans but it is known to be dangerous. Barry Barr is selected to leave the ship to clear the meteorite debris for the sake of the crew. He works on cutting the meteorite debris, reflecting on the growing tension between himself and Robson Hind, the jet chief, over their mutual interest in Dorothy Voorhees, the dietician and toxicologist. Barry wakes up later feeling like he doesn't have enough air, and searches for a meal. As he tries to eat, he realizes he can't breathe, and it occurs to him that his suit's Kendall-shield, which was supposed to protect him from Sigma radiation, had leaked. Nobody knew quite what would happen to Barry after exposure to Sigma radiation. His breathing got worse over time and nobody could do anything for him without a doctor. The ship successfully lands on Venus, and Barry finds that the humid atmosphere makes it easier for him to breathe. He finds Dorothy, kissing her before Robson Hind shows up, then passes out and wakes up in a doctor's office. Barry inhales the water he was handed (literally ingesting it), surprising the doctor, who doesn't know what to do for Barry. They notice gills on Barry's neck, and Barry passes out again. Barry asks Nick Podtaguine, the mechanic, for help in building a machine. It seems Barry is now known for having saved the ship, so Nick figures he can get all the materials he needs, which only took him eight hours. The machine keeps Barry's room wet while keeping the excess water off of the floor. Barry recovers some energy now that he can breathe, and dreams of Dorothy Voorhees as he rests. He starts to develop webs on his hands and feet, and a full set of gills, but Dorothy still comes to visit him one day after having avoided Barry the entire time he'd been under the doctor's care. This helps his mood, but then he wakes up one day finding his machine turned off, and is unable to escape. Eventually he breaks a plastic window but the air doesn't have enough moisture for him, so he breaks out and jumps into the water. He faints again, inhales, and realizes his gills work just fine, which also makes him realize he is officially no longer human. He swims away from some worms who are interested in his eyelids, and eventually makes it to the ocean even though he wants to stay near the people. His lungs have not adjusted yet so he sinks again, awoken by yells of people. Barry finds a creature who looked a lot like Barry, with webbed limbs and pieces of clothing. The story ends in a skirmish with various Venusians and one other Earthman. "

        "Summary_1": "Barry Barr transforms from a regular human male to a creature that breathes underwater and requires moisture to survive. After being exposed to Sigma radiation while removing particles from the outer hull of Four, Barry began to feel changes in his body. Air felt dry and hot in his lungs and he quickly developed shortness of breath. Fainting spells ensued and breathing difficulties. Once they arrived on Venus, Dr. Carl Jensen gave a grave diagnosis of the unknown. Barry developed dark marks on both sides of his neck, which soon transformed into gills. Webbing grew between his fingers and toes, and his revulsion to dry air only grew. He built a moisture machine to keep in his room so he could breathe comfortably. But it still wasn\u2019t enough. On the night he was trapped inside of the dry room, he broke out and escaped to the water. Although his lungs weren\u2019t fully adjusted to breathing water, he took off like a rocket and battled several Venusian creatures with ease. Barry goes from completely human to a humanoid merman of sorts. ",
        "Summary_2": "After volunteering for the spacewalk to remove the meteorite debris, Barr wakens from a nap unusually hungry and has trouble breathing the air on the ship. As he tries to eat, he notices a sense of heat and dryness that bothers him so much that it becomes difficult to breathe. When his meal is over, he loses consciousness just after it dawns on him that the Kendall-shield on his spacesuit had leaked. Barr suffers delirium, fever, fainting spells, and unquenchable thirst; all the while, breathing becomes increasingly difficult for him. After drawing a plan, his friend Nick builds a humidifier for Barr, which keeps his room so humid that water is dripping off the walls; this enables him to breathe more freely. When he gets a glass of water, he pours it down his throat while breathing, meaning the water goes into his lungs. The doctor doesn\u2019t know what is happening to Barr, but he tells him that if a normal person poured water in their lungs like that, they would die of a coughing spasm or congestive pneumonia. Once they land on Venus, however, Barr can breathe easily due to the humid air. Barr also has rudimentary gills growing on the sides of his neck, and webbed skins begin growing between his fingers and toes as his gills develop further. When Hinds cuts off the humidifier to Barr\u2019s room and locks him in, Barr would have died if he hadn\u2019t been able to break the window and get out. Even then, his gills have developed so much that the Venusian air doesn\u2019t completely take care of his needs. Not until he submerges himself in the water of the slough can Barr breathe freely. When he makes his way to the ocean, he encounters creatures who are nearly human but who, like Barr, have webbed fingers and toes, so it appears that Barr has become a Venusian.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Barry had been chosen for the Five Ships Plan because of his structural engineering expertise as well as his experience in tropical climates. His job in the Venus Colony would be to repurpose the ships that would be left behind on Venus into useful items as well as to study native Venusian materials. After stepping out into space to remove the debris from the outside of Number Four, Barry succumbs to Sigma radiation poisoning and begins to physically transform. At first, he has difficulty breathing in the air pumped through the spaceship. When Number Four lands on Venus, he is pleased to discover the thick humidity eases the choking in his throat. But the water in the atmosphere is not enough, and he continues to experience severe pains in his body as the change continues. Dr. Carl Jensen helps him through this process; he initially identifies the darkening patch on the sides of his neck as rudimentary gills. In addition, Barry develops webbed feet. Although his love for Dorothy has motivated Barry to push through adversity to arrive safely on Venus, he begins to realize that his physical developments are going to become a permanent barrier between his old reality and his new one. He can no longer breathe on land, so he desperately plunges into the water. As he swims into the ocean, his lungs fill with water and he can breathe easier. He also runs into the elusive Venusian natives, who look much like humans with bodies adapted to life underwater. This will likely become Barry's new home.",
        "Summary_4": "Before the story begins, Barry volunteers for the Five Ship Plan with his experience in tropical conditions making him a good fit. At the Training Base, he meets Dorothy Voorhees who he falls for, but Robson Hind is also interested, so Barry doesn't trust Robson. At the start of the story, Barry wakes up with the ship in free fall and works with the rest of the crew to stabalize whatever systems they can. After he is exposed to Sigma radiation, it gets harder and harder for him to breathe over time. In the early stages, he faints a lot, and develops a fever, becomes delirious, and has an unquenchable thirst. When he is exposed to Venusian air, it becomes easier for him to breathe and his chest pains become more manageable. After he passes out again, he starts inhaling water to put it straight into his lungs, surprising his doctor, which leads to him noticing the gills developing on his neck. His hands and feet grow webs as his gills developed further, and his depression gets worse through the transformation. He wakes up one day to find his machine has been turned off, andd has to break out of the room and jump into the water to save himself, where he learns that his gills work perfectly well. He finds he is much more comfortable underwater even though he still needs more time to adapt to these changes, as his lungs are still strained very quickly which impacts his endurance."

        "Summary_1": "Venus is a hot and muggy planet, most comparable to certain areas of South America. The air is so moist and hot that many of the colonists when arrived felt as though they were melting or wading through a swamp. Much of the planet is covered in swamps and marshes, while only a small portion is made up of solid rock or land. The air teems with buzzing insects and creatures roam the surface of the planet. Large vegetarian Venusian creatures roam solid ground, and, though they aren\u2019t going to eat the humans, their humongous size can make them a danger to have around. Different creatures reside in the swamps and oceans as well. Flesh-eating worms lie deep in the swamps, while humanoid Venusians live out in the open ocean. ",
        "Summary_2": "Venus has a climate like a tropical swamp, sweltering and extremely humid, and the air is thick with the foul odor of decaying plants. Much of the planet is covered with swamps and mud so that the colony has to set up on a rock ledge that rises out of the marsh. Days on Venus last 82 hours. Trees grow in the marshes, and there are areas of quicksand covered with green algae that look like grassy plains. Some plants are edible by humans, but there is also a plant with a poisonous thorn that killed a man. Plants grow rapidly due to the climate. The stagnant slough drains into a waveless, saltwater ocean. Approximately half of the surface is covered with water. The land areas are either rocky ledges or jungle-covered swamps. Tests indicate that there are traces of oil and radioactive minerals. \n\tMany different types of creatures live on Venus. In the marsh, there are creatures that slither and crawl, swim, and fly. Gigantic insects fly around but are harmless and avoid the humans. There are varied creatures in the swamps; the ones that look harmless tend to be the most venomous. One particularly interesting creature somewhat resembles the brontosauri of Earth and are amphibious, armored monsters. They are vegetarians and don\u2019t bother the humans except that they can be clumsy and step on or fall against a human structure damaging it. In the early days, there is no sign of intelligent life, but some of the men report having a sense of being watched. One particularly bothersome creature is a fat worm that lives in the slough; when Barr is in the slough, these worms attach themselves to his eyelids and bite them, clinging to him like leeches.\n\tIn the ocean, however, Barr encounters human-like creatures like himself, with webbed fingers and toes. They wield weapons like spears and other tubelike weapons that fire underwater, creating a trail of bubbles as they move rapidly toward the prey. These human-like beings attack Barr, and he notices they wear clothes. They bleed a red substance when they are injured and have bones that Barr feels when he strikes one with a knife. There are both male and female creatures.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Venus is hot and extremely humid and covered with the aroma of decaying vegetation. The complete opposite of Mars' deserted, dry landscape, Venus is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. Half of the planet is covered in water, including marshes, swamps, sloughs, and vast oceans with murky water. There are few areas of rock ledges where the crews of the Five Ship Plan build their colony. Many kinds of harmless insects fly about the swamps, but there are several poisonous plants, one of which kills a crew member from Number One. A species of massive, swamp-dwelling, amphibious, dinosaur-like creatures move about close to the makeshift colony; because of their lack of intelligence and immense, armored bodies, the creatures can be quite dangerous and actually have damaged one of the colony's buildings. When Barry first dives into the slough, he is immediately attacked by a horde of worms attempting to burrow into his skin. Later, he discovers the native Venusians, who look like humans, carry spears and tube-weapons, and move rapidly through the water with powerful bodies and webbed hands. ",
        "Summary_4": "Venus' surface is covered in mists and creatures unfamiliar to people from Earth. Dorothy Voorhees is a toxicologist and dietitian specifically assigned to the mission to guide the humans through the flora and fauna of Venus in a way that their digestive systems wouldn't entirely object to. The fact that she was hired points to the humans knowing they would face unknowns. The plants that had been discovered before Barry arrived were edible but not interesting. What looked like a grassy plain was really quicksand covered in algae, which meant the colonists had lost many supplies while making this discovery. The wood from the trees was used to create crafts, and various types of buildings and support structures. There is one piece of solid ground (rock, specifically) that the men were able to find, though it was still surrounded by swamps. In the heavy mists of the humid swamplands are a variety of insects that were far more annoying than harmful. There are larger creatures, too, the most exciting being large swamp creatures that resembled dinosaurs, who were vegetarian but large and dumb enough to pose great danger to the humans. \n"

        "Query": "What is the role of Robson Hind in THE LOST TRIBES OF VENUS and how does he impact the relationship between Barry and Dorothy?",
        "Article": "Barry developed definite external signs of what the Sigma radiation had\ndone to him. The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into\nmembranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and\ndark parallel lines appeared.\n  \n \n  But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not\nstopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had\nto believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the\nweird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still\nhe was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's\nfailure to visit him did not help his mental condition.\n  \n \n  Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming.\nDorothy was leaning over him.\n  \n \n  \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you\ndo have a wife and child in Philadelphia. I know it's wrong but all\nthat seems so far away it doesn't matter any more.\" Tears glistened in\nher eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\" he grunted. \"Who? Me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, Barry, don't lie. She wrote to me before Three blasted\noff\u2014oh, the most piteous letter!\"\n  \n \n  Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child.\nI've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted.

Long months away from the patterned restraints of\ncivilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had\nawakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a\nwoman, as well as a toxicologist.\n  \n \n  When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous\nand confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger\nsimmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging\nRobson Hind's features.\n  \n \n  The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but\nthis time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had\nmade Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had\ncarried him too far.

He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist\nmachine that no longer hummed.

He was trapped.\n  \n \n  Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair\nand swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again.\nA small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under\ncontinued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning\nstrength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered.\n  \n \n  He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden\nVenusian air poured in\u2014but it was not enough!\n  \n \n  He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed\nsprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused\nrustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of\napproaching unconsciousness.\n  \n \n  There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched\nforward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground.\n  \n \n  Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of\ncolored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth\nhabits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath.\n  \n \n  Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung\nslack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his\nlife since the moment of birth forced him to inhale.\n  \n \n  Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze\nof the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the\nbrackish, silt-clouded water.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became\naware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew\ninstinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock\nthe meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from\nall other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony\nwere separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless\nvoid between Earth and Venus.\n  \n \n  Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened\nhis eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something\nburrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat\nworm between his fingers.\n  \n \n  Then dozens of them\u2014hundreds\u2014were upon him from all sides. He was\nwearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to\ncongregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his\neyelids.\n  \n \n  For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in\nincreasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and\nburrowed, and blindly he began to swim.\n  \n \n  Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and\nkept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one\nthe worms dropped off.\n  \n \n  He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on\na faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier\nhere, and clearer.\n  \n \n  He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn\nback, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he\ncould not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of\ndirection.\n  \n \n  He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to\nunderwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of\nhands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and\nceased. He sank.\n  \n \n  Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory\nsystem completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At\nlast he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless.\n  \n \n  Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a\ngasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving\ntoward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a\nfigure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat.\nOne figure drifted limply bottomward.\n  \n \n  Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from\nthe group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet\nmoved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the\nEarthman.\n  \n \n  Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the\nsticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder.\n  \n \n  Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung\nin a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to\nineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking\nand clawing.\n  \n \n  Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted\nthe attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to\nthe creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working.\n  \n \n  Human\u2014or nearly so\u2014the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and\nwebbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more\nfor ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face\nwas coarse and savage.\n  \n \n  It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched\na short tube from its belt.\n  \n \n  Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as\nhe flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the\nwater and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something\nzipped past his head, uncomfortably close.\n  \n \n  Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone.\nHe struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp.\n  \n \n  Barry stared through the reddening water.\n  \n \n  Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's\nspear from the mud and raised it defensively.\n  \n \n  But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled\ndesperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his\nspear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the\nother was upon her from behind.\n  \n \n  One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender\nbody backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the\nbottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help\nsecure her arms and legs with lengths of cord.\n  \n \n  One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at\nher brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the\ndead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were\nloot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic\nnecklace the girl wore but it did not break.\n  \n \n  He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear.\nThe girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out.\n  \n \n  Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear\nready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously.\n  \n \n  Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His\nown lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each\nother's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the\ninside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman\narched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature\ngasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in\nits belly.\n  \n \n  The other one turned too late as Barry leaped.\n  \n \n  Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone.\n  \n<doc-sep>The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinking\npinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tiny\nfigure crawling along the hull.

Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task\nrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on\nthe events that had brought him here.\n  \n \n  First Luna, and that had been murderous.

        "Summary_1": "Robson Hind is a very wealthy man and jet chief of Number Four. The son of the manager of Hoskins Corporation, Hind was basically guaranteed a spot in the Five Ship Plan. Just like Barry Barr, he was instantly attracted to Dorothy Voorhees and her jet-black hair, high cheekbones, and intelligence. Before their ships take off, Hind conspires to join her on Number Three or transfer her to Number Four. However, his scheme eventually fails. Before Three lifts off, he sends Dorothy a letter pretending to be Barry\u2019s imaginary wife from Philadelphia, asking her to stay away from him so his wife and children can still have him. This works for a time in keeping Dorothy away from Barry. Once again, however, Hind\u2019s scheme ultimately fails once they arrive on Venus and Dorothy is near Barry again. \nWhile on Number Four, Hind refuses to exit the spaceship to work on the meteor shards, citing his assigned status. When Barry volunteers, Hind is secretly happy, almost as if he wants him out of the picture for good. \nAfter their arrival on Venus, Dorothy stays away from Barry for a time, but eventually runs into his hospital room and embraces him. She discovers that Hind\u2019s letter was a lie and rushes into Barry\u2019s arms for good. Presumably, once Hind discovered this, he dismantled Barry\u2019s life-saving moisture machine and locked him in the room to die. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Robson Hind is the jet chief of Four, the fourth of the five ships sent to Venus under the Five Ship Plan. As a member of the Five Ship Plan, he has been vetted both for his jobs skills and his personality and sense of responsibility, but he is uncouth, unethical, and self-centered. He is the son of the business manager of the Hoskins Corporation which holds a large share in the Five Ship Plan. Additionally, he is competing with Barry Barr for the affections of the beautiful young woman, Dorothy Voorhees. Dorothy likes Barry, but she can\u2019t help but be impressed by the smooth-talking Hinds whose wealth enables him to entertain her in style. When Dorothy is assigned to ship Three, Hinds tries to have her reassigned to Four and then himself to Three, neither of which works. \n\tAlthough Hinds knows his job, he is questionable in his suitability for the Five Ship Plan. As Number Four descends toward Venus, a meteorite sideswipes the ship, and a few pieces break off and fuse themselves to the nonmetallic tube casing of a nozzle, causing the driver to overload, sending heat and radiation into the compartment and killing the person in there. Once they can enter the compartment, Hinds hangs back and enters last. He is responsible for changing the accelerators and afterward throws the switch confidently only to have the system almost overload again before he switches it off. Hinds determines the problem is metal in the field, which will require someone to go outside the ship and cut it out. This is a dangerous job because of the high levels of Sigma concentration that are known to kill lab animals with just a brief exposure. What isn\u2019t known is how well a spacesuit will protect a human. Everyone waits to see who will volunteer, and their eyes turn to Hinds, who quickly reminds them he is assigned and therefore not expendable. Barry Barr volunteers since he is unassigned.\n\tWhen Barr is under the doctor\u2019s care, he desperately wants to see Dorothy, and when she finally comes, she claims she can\u2019t stay away because she loves him too much, even if he has a wife and child. She received a letter just before Three blasted off. Barr isn\u2019t married, and he strongly suspects that Hinds is behind the fake letter. Hinds is also responsible for almost killing Barr by cutting the power and water to the humidifier that keeps him alive and locking the door so Barr can\u2019t escape.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Robson Hind is the jet chief of Number Four as well as the electronics expert for Venus Colony. He is young, handsome, and wealthy. The sole child of the business manager of Hoskins Corporation, Hind's position with the Five Ship Plan could be attributed to the fact that his father's business held a large share of it. When the meteorite strikes Number Four, Hind immediately says he cannot go outside to fix it because he has an assignment on the ship, and he is non-expendable. He barely conceals a smile when Barry offers to take care of it instead. Like Barry, Hind is attracted to Dorothy Voorhees. However, in spite of his charms and his lavish doting, Hind fails to capture Dorothy's heart because she senses something she does not like in his personality. This shrewdness of character perception turns out to be quite accurate when Hind writes a letter to Dorothy pretending to be Barry's non-existent wife revealing herself to Dorothy and telling her that Barry also has a child in Philadelphia. This only delays Dorothy's confession of love to Barry, so Hind steps up his efforts to keep the two separated. He locks Barry in his room and disables the machine that had been supplying Venusian air for Barry to breathe. Although Hind's efforts to kill Barry fail, he does succeed in driving him away into the ocean where Barry will presumably stay.",
        "Summary_4": "Robson Hind is a member of the crew of Number Four, where he serves as the jet chief, and will be the electronics expert for Venus Colony. He has bold, handsome features and gives the impression of being strong without being large. Hind is the one who cuts the power lines to prevent a second blowback while they're all trying to find a solution for their freefall. He is looked to for guidance throughout the problem-solving due to his leadership position, and was the best candidate to clear the Sigma radiation but defered the role to Barry Barr to protect himself. There is tension because Barry and Robson both like Dorothy Voorhees. Dorothy is under the impression that Barry is married to someone else, and it turns out Robson Hind likely is the one who planted this misinformation in her mind through writing a false letter."

        "Summary_1": "After discovering Mars and the moon, humanity decided to conquer yet another planet: Venus. However, Venus was too far away to safely carry the amount of fuel needed for a round trip mission. So, the Five Ship Plan evolved. Five rockets were to fly to Venus at separate intervals. Those who landed first would build a colony to live in and welcome the others to the surface of the planet. Once all five had arrived, they would figure out which ship was in the best shape and transfer all remaining fuel to that one. The colonists would head back home if Venus was completely uninhabitable, or remain on the planet for the time being, living out their lives on the colony. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Five Ship Plan was devised as a way to provide travel to and from Venus and is a joint venture between the government and private groups. It is a clever solution to the problem of ships only holding enough fuel for a one-way trip to Venus. Under the plan, five ships make the journey carrying as much fuel as they possibly can and loaded with various cargo needed for survival on the planet. When all five are on Venus, the ship in the best condition will receive the remaining fuel left in the other ships to return to Earth. Barry Barr\u2019s job will then be to repurpose the materials of the other ships into whatever the colony needs, such as a landing dock and launching ramp. Members of the Five Ship Plan are chosen for their expertise in their fields and their sense of responsibility. They are expected to be so committed to the mission that they are willing to sacrifice themselves so that the mission can succeed. Much of the code of the plan is based on the ancient Earth code for the sea and requires members to perform actions \u201cfor the safety of the ship.\u201d",
        "Summary_3": "The Five Ship Plan had been designed by a joint enterprise of government and private groups to establish the Venus Colony after humans successfully visited Mars. Because the fuel requirements to make the round trip from Earth to Venus would bring a ship to critical mass, five ships would fill their tanks as much as safely possible, land on Venus, and the ship that had sustained the least amount of damage would take on the fuel reserves of the other four for the return trip to Earth unless a successful colony could be established on Venus. The crews for the five ships needed to be responsible individuals and Barry was chosen for his familiarity with tropical conditions and his abilities as a structural engineer. His job in the Venus Colony would be to repurpose the ships that would be left behind on Venus into whatever would be needed as well as to study native Venusian materials. Dorothy Voorhees was the crew's toxicologist and dietician. Other crew members included Dr. Carl Jensen, Robson Hind, Nick Podtiaguine, and Captain Reno.",
        "Summary_4": "The Five Ship Plan was developed by various private and government groups in an attempt to blow past the existing limitations on space travel. These are dangerous expeditions manned by specialists with strong senses of responsibility who the leaders of the Plan expect to be able to maintain themselves and their crews for long enough to make it to Venus, where the leftover fuel from all five ships would be combined to one for a return journey. The specifics of the return trip would depend on who made it to Venus, what they found there, and what they could establish in the Colony."

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Sitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to\nlet him have it at the first sight of actual violence.\n  \n \n  Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have\nnotified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the\ndeath of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"\n  \n \n  \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He's going to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun\ntrigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it\nsavagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the\nsword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of\nbluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\n  \n \n  Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door\nflew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the\ngreen sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down\nat the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\n  \n \n  \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.\n  \n \n  \"Y-yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint\nbeing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the\nuntimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of\nthe Ghrynian policemen.\n  \n \n  \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver\nof the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several\nminutes ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest\nyou for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than\n$100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the\nUniverse can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  responsible?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to\nthis late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, no, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Roy Walton is the Assistant Administrator of the Bureau of Population Equalization, otherwise known as Popeek. In the six weeks that they have been working, thousands of people have been euthanized, sterilized, and relocated in order to curb population growth and overcrowding. Roy Walton arrives at his desk, filled with papers, and settles into his miserable job. He asks for a relocation of the people of central Belgium to Patagonia before his receptionist alerts him Mr. Prior is here to see him. He refuses, but Mr. Prior sneaks through security and the unlocked door\u2013Walton\u2019s fault\u2013and demands his attention. He is a famous poet, one Walton admires. He asks Walton to save his son who is to be euthanized for being tubercular. Walton turns him down, but after Prior leaves, his words swim in his head. He realizes he wants to save his baby, and so he sets off to do just that. He runs into his boss, Director FitzMaugham in the elevator and tries to lie his way through the encounter. He narrowly succeeds but is left with the feeling that Director FitzMaughan knew more than he was letting on. Walton gets off at the 20th floor and breezes past the receptionist to input Philp Porter into the computer. A series of cards come out, detailing all the baby\u2019s specifics as well as the tubercular diagnosis. He deletes the cause for euthanization and inputs the new data into the system. He comes back clear. \nHoping no one saw him, he walks down past the hall of babies and chats with the doctor, asking where his brother, another doctor, is. Evidently, his brother is running analytics, so Walton is safe for now. He speaks with the executioner, Falbrough, and tells him to double-check every baby before euthanization, due to an unfortunate incident in Europe. Falbrough agrees, and Walton quickly slips back upstairs to his office. Worrying about his actions that day, Walton gets a call from Falbrough informing him that there was a mistake, and they saved a baby\u2019s life that day. Walton tells him to keep it under wraps, and he quickly hangs up. Walton has now committed a felony, and he\u2019s wondering what the long-term effects will be. His brother, Fred, calls him and tells him that he knows what he did. By accessing confidential information (a crime in and of itself), Fred knows that Roy saved that baby\u2019s life illegally. He holds it over his head and asks for a favor in return, as well as silence on Roy\u2019s end. The story ends with Roy\u2019s fate up in the air as well as the fate of the new world order. \n",
        "Summary_2": "In the 23rd century, Earth is overpopulated with 7 billion people. Until Venus terraforming is up and running and travel to stars is feasible, the world\u2019s citizens have approved Weeding the Garden and the Euthanasia plan to remove substandard people from society. The Bureau of Population Equalization is working to distribute the population more evenly, removing people from overpopulated areas and resettling them in sparsely populated areas. Roy Walton is the assistant administrator of the Bureau and makes decisions about moving groups of people.  While these decisions bother him, he tries to follow the director\u2019s maxim: to stay sane, he must think of the people as pawns, not human beings. In his office, facing three-foot mounds of paperwork, Roy can disassociate himself from the humans whose lives he is impacting.\n\tSuddenly, however, he is asked to meet with a Mr. Prior, whose two-week-old son is scheduled for euthanasia (Happysleep). He refuses to see Prior because these decisions are irrevocable, but Prior makes his way into Roy\u2019s office anyway, and Roy recognizes him as a famous poet whose work he admires. Prior informs Roy that his son is committed to Happysleep because he is potentially tubercular; Prior informs Roy that he was tubercular as a child but was cured. And he reminds Roy that if euthanasia had been practiced a generation ago, his poetry wouldn\u2019t exist. Roy tells Prior he cannot help him, but after Prior leaves, Roy is haunted. \n\tRoy decides to save Prior\u2019s baby, convincing himself that saving one child won\u2019t break the system, and makes his way to the euthanasia department. He takes the lift tube where he meets the director, who invites Roy to have a coffee break with him and asks if Mr. Prior met with Roy. The director says Prior tried to see him but that he referred him to Roy. When Roy turns down the coffee break and exits the lift on the euthanasia floor, he is sure the director knows what he is doing. Roy pulls the information on the baby and rewrites it, omitting the 3f2 designation: tubercular-prone. Roy also notifies the euthanasia doctor of a new policy, effective immediately, of checking the computer records for all babies before euthanasia due to a tragic error in Europe yesterday.\n\tRoy returns to his office and receives two significant phone calls. First, the euthanasia doctor for babies contacts him to let him know one baby scheduled for Happysleep that morning was indeed not due for it. The second call is from his brother, who works in the euthanasia department. When he learned that Roy had used the computer earlier and of the \u201cmistake\u201d for one of the babies, he requested a transcript of Roy\u2019s work on the computer, so he knows of Roy\u2019s crime. Roy and his brother have a hostile relationship, so Roy now has to worry about his brother revealing his crime, even though he says he won\u2019t since Roy got him the job with the Bureau.\n",
        "Summary_3": "This story takes place in the 23rd century on a heavily overcrowded Earth. The main character, Roy Walton, is the assistant administrator of the Bureau of Population Equalization. In his own office in this ugly building, at a desk piled high with more reports than he could handle, he starts to look through them and responded to one. Because the Bureau is fairly new, procedures are also still being developed. Walton's staff lets him know someone is here to see him about a Happysleep commitment (meaning someone is going to be euthanized), and Lyle Prior bursts into the office. Walton lets him stay to have a meeting but kicks his guards out: it turns out Prior is a poet who Walton recognizes. They have a hard conversation about Lyle's son, a two-week-old who is genetically susceptible to tuberculosis and is thus sentenced to be euthanized. Lyle points out that he had tuberculosis as a child, and if he had been euthanized instead of cured, his poetry would not exist. Walton has to sit alone with this, as a huge fan of Prior's work, and thinks about the thousands who had been killed or sterilized in the six weeks his office had been open so far. Walton nervously decides he has to do something even though it would be illegal, and heads out of his office, promising himself that Prior's child is the only one he would break the law for. Walton runs into Director FitzMaugham who notices he looks preoccupied; they talk about Prior and FitzMaugham reminds Walton that if they made one exception to their rules, the entire system would fall. When Walton gets off the elevator, he worries that his destination has given away his mission, but heads into the room with the euthanasia files. After looking through Philip's files, he realizes he only has half an hour to act; he re-writes Philip's file to remove the euthanasia recommendation, but still has to retrieve the baby unnoticed. The doctors are surprised to see Walton in the clinic, especially because they'd seen the Director earlier as well. Walton asks if his younger brother, another doctor, is around, so that he can try to avoid him before continuing to the execution chamber to find Philip. Walton runs into Falbrough, the executioner, and tells him to double-check all of the files in case a mistake had been made, hoping that the updated file will take care of the issue for him. Walton returns to his office and gets a call from Falbrough who wasn't sure what to do about Philip, whose record did not have a euthanasia recommendation--Walton tells him to keep it quiet and to get the child back to his parents. As he let it sink in that he had broken the law, Walton's brother calls. Fred had noticed that Roy had messed with the computer system and knows everything that happened; Roy panics after hanging up the phone.",
        "Summary_4": "In the year 2232, the world has voted for the implementation of Equalization Laws and the establishment of the Bureau of Population Equalization, also called Popeek, in order to address the problem of overpopulation. Roy Walton is the second-in-command at Popeek, and his job is to oversee the population equalization process, which redistributes people from overcrowded cities into lower population density areas. In addition, he is responsible for the administration of the global Euthanasia Centers. These clinics carry out the controversial \"Happysleep\" procedure, which is effectively euthanasia, upon children and adults considered substandard. Having been appointed to his position by Director FitzMaugham (whom he had also worked for when FitzMaugham was a senator fighting for Equalization Laws), Roy is a reliable steward of his job, and he barricades himself in his office so he doesn't have to face those opposed to Happysleep. As Roy goes about his busy workday, including ordering a reporting on the feasibility of transferring Belgian citizens to Patagonia, the annunciator notifies him that Lyle Prior, the famous poet, is there to visit him. Lyle's son, Philip, has been scheduled for Happysleep because he had been born tubercular. As a fan of Lyle's poetry, Roy is pleased with his visit, but he does not grant Lyle's request. To do so would risk his career and subvert the work of Popeek and the Equalization Laws in general. After Lyle departs, Roy thinks about his argument that if Lyle had been euthanized for the same reason when he was a child, the world would have been denied his poetry. In spite of Roy's reservations, he decides to spare Philip, but only Philip. He takes an elevator down to the Euthanasia Clinic and is joined by Director FitzMaugham, who acts like he knows what Roy is up to. Roy proceeds to the files room at the clinic and accesses Philip's record on the computer; he removes the euthanasia recommendation from his record and proceeds to the area where Dr. Falbrough administers the fatal procedure. He informs Falbrough that a new policy requires baby's records to be checked again prior to being euthanized to avoid any errors. Upon returning to his office, Roy received a call from his brother Fred, who works as a doctor in the clinic. Fred says he knows Roy edited Philip's record, but he will keep it a secret and call it even since Roy had secured him the job in the clinic in the first place."

LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  The Code was rigid\u2014no fraternization with the\n   \n  peoples of other planets!

        "Summary_1": "In the year 2232, the Earth\u2019s population of humans had maxed out at seven billion. This huge influx of people and steady population growth caused major poverty, starvation, and trade/supply issues. For these reasons and more, the Equalization Law was implemented in order to contain humanity and limit population growth. One such rule under this new world order was the Equalization Law where all newborn babies must be presented before they are two weeks old to be examined. If they do not have any congenital defects or carry any unwanted genes, they will be allowed to live. If not, they will be committed to euthanization, otherwise known as Happysleep. As well, several thousand members of the elderly population were euthanized, as they were already on death\u2019s doorstep. Thousands of men were sterilized in order to prevent any insufficient offspring, and those that were ill or handicapped in some way were also euthanized. \nAs for overcrowding, the Bureau of Population Equalization (Popeek) also relocates certain groups of people to more empty settings. For example, Roy Walton set up a relocation for several thousand people in Belgium to the empty areas of Patagonia. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Equalization Laws were proposed for legislation by Mr. FitzMaugham fifty years earlier, and when it passed, he was made director of the organization in charge of administering the laws. In the new world order and under the Equalization Laws, the Bureau of Population Equalization is tasked with redistributing the population to make the population density more balanced. It also manages the population numbers by identifying children genetically predisposed to medical conditions deemed unsuited for life and euthanizes them (euphemistically called sending them to Happysleep). The Bureau also identifies other unsuitable (\u201csubstandard\u201d) people for euthanasia, such as the very old and terminally ill. And subnormal males are sterilized to prevent them from procreating and passing on their traits. This \u201ccleaning out\u201d of the population is known as \u201cWeeding the Garden\u201d and was voted on by the population. These steps are considered necessary until more space is available for humans, either through terraforming Venus or opening the stars to mankind. Both projects are underway but not fully operational yet. \n",
        "Summary_3": "In this version of Earth in the 23rd century, the population is so large that people are moved from high-density areas to lower-density areas when possible, but more drastic measures are being put in place to control the population. Six weeks before the story starts, in the year 2232, the Bureau of Population Equalization is founded to coordinate a lot of these efforts. Another major effort of theirs is a project called Happysleep, which euthanizes children who are genetically susceptible to certain diseases. In order to get rid of tuberculosis, for instance, they are trying to kill off people with the \"TB-susceptible genetic traits\". The Equalization Law criminalizes saving the life of a potentially-tubercular child, which Walton knows when he leaves his office after his conversation with Lyle Prior. This same group also sterilizes men to the same effect. The main way that the Equalization Laws that govern these decisions work is that children have to go to a local clinic within two weeks of birth, and this is when these decisions are made. The other major way these Laws contribute to the story is that these are the Laws that Roy Walton is breaking when he decides to save Philip Prior's life.",
        "Summary_4": "In order to deal with the world's overpopulation problem, Senator FitzMaugham had fought for the establishment of the Bureau of Population Equalization, or Popeek, in order to oversee the process of balancing out overcrowded areas with parts of the world with smaller populations. For example, when Belgium's population becomes too untenable, Roy requests a report on the viability of sending a number of them to live in Patagonia, where the population density remains low. In addition to the process of equalization, the more controversial measure of euthanasia in the form of \"Happysleep\" takes place at Euthanasia Centers around the world to wipe out adults and children considered \"substandard\" because of genetic diseases, physical disabilities, mental challenges, etc. The Equalization Laws also require every newborn child to be examined at a local clinic to determine if they are suitable for a birth certificate or if they will be scheduled for Happysleep. Roughly one in ten thousand is scheduled for the euthanasia procedure. Saving Philip Prior's life would be considered a criminal act under the Equalization Laws, but Roy Walton does it anyway, swayed by Lyle's argument that if he had been euthanized as a baby because of his tuberculosis, the world would never have his poetry."

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Master of Life and Death by Robert Silverberg takes place on Earth many years in the future, specifically June 10, 2232, or six weeks after the equalization laws were implemented. The story takes place within the confines of the Cullen building, specifically through the twentieth and twenty-ninth floors. It starts in Roy Walton\u2019s office on the twenty-eighth floor, designed \u00e0 la 22nd Century neo-Victorian style. Roy redesigned his office, changing the lights, windows, and removing the trim, but the room still felt ugly to him. His office has a desk with a firearm strapped to the bottom, and the door features a lock so as to prevent an assassination. He communicates with people through a holographic video call, and papers and assignments are sent to his desk immediately. Throughout the story, Roy travels down the elevator to the 20th floor, otherwise known as the Euthanization Clinic. There is a receptionist there as well as several computers. Different offices house different doctors, but he makes his to the center for babies where the executioner works. The rooms are very sterile and hospital-like. Each baby had its own pen, and several doctors examined them all while parents watched from screens. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in the 23rd century when the Earth\u2019s population has reached seven billion, and people live in extremely crowded conditions. All of the action in the story takes place in the hundred-story Cullen Building, where the Bureau of Population Equalization takes up the 20th through the 29th floors. The building was built in the 22nd century in a neo-Victorian style that is grossly overdecorated and outdated. The overdone nature of the building itself is symbolic of the foolish recklessness of the population of the last century, which led to massive global overpopulation. The structure and Bureau are outfitted with modern technology, including a pneumochute that rapidly delivers paperwork to its destination. Telephones are equipped with video capability so that callers can see each other as they talk, and a lift tube provides transport between floors. Records are stored in memory tubes, microfilm, and computers. Genetic testing is used to identify children with conditions that make them substandard and require their euthanasia. The Bureau has only been up and running for six weeks, but it has already accumulated an impressive quantity of records and data. Workers have become accustomed to their roles; one glibly reports they had identified seven children for Happysleep that morning, the \u201cbiggest haul we\u2019ve had yet.\u201d",
        "Summary_3": "The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization are in a tall office building that is overdecorated and ugly with a lot of chrome and bright lights. Roy Walton had made some changes to his own office to make it more visually tolerable. Besides these offices, the other part of the story takes place in a records room and in the local clinic where Walton runs into a number of doctors and the executioner, Falbrough. In the clinic, there is an execution hall where the children are sent to be euthanized. Beyond just the physical aspects of the setting, this story takes place in June of the year 2232. At this time, Earth is extremely overpopulated, and the story's events take place around the policies that are being put into place in an attempt to control some of this overpopulation.",
        "Summary_4": "The story takes place on June 10, 2232 at the offices of the newly-established Bureau of Population Equalization, commonly known as Popeek, which is located on the 20th - 29th floors of the Cullen Building. The Cullen Building has one hundred stories and is crafted in the 22nd century neo-Victorian style. Roy Walton's office is on the 28th floor directly below Director FitzMaugham's, and he has redecorated it to fit his personal taste: He has replaced the sash windows with opaquers and added electroluminescents in place of the old ceiling fixture. Roy's desk is stacked with papers, which continuously arrive through pneumochutes, and he keeps a needler gun in his drawer for protection. An annunciator alerts Roy when he has visitors. Outside Roy's office is an outer office where six secretaries work. He takes an elevator down to the 20th floor where his brother works at the Euthanasia Clinic and Files. The euthanasia file room is thirty feet by twenty feet and filled with Donnerson micro-memory tubes and microfilm records. Popeek has various local offices and euthanasia centers around the world, where people considered substandard are sent on to \"Happysleep.\""

LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Five doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main\nsection of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there,\neach in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one\nto the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above.\n  \n \n  The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its\nlocal clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a\ncertificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a\ncertificate ... and life.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\"\n  \n \n  Walton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to\nkeep in touch with every department we have, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're\nreally getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\"\n  \n \n  \"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could\ndo about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose.\n  \n \n  \"Seen my brother around?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him\nfor you, Mr. Walton?\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly,\nWalton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in\nthe employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and\nRoy did not care to have Fred know he was down there.\n  \n \n  Strolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump,\nsqualling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc,\ntwo blind, one congenital syph.\"\n  \n \n  \"That only makes six,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet.\nSeven in one morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have any trouble with the parents?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to\nunderstand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\"\n  \n \n  Walton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm.\n  \n \n  Silence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it\nup for you if you like.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly.\n  \n \n  He moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution\nchamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at\nhis desk when Walton appeared.\n  \n \n  Falbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He\nwas short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact\nlenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hundred, as usual.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said.\n\"To keep public opinion on our side.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that\ncomes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no\nmistake. Got that?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mistake?\n   \n  But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one\nof the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets\nout.\"\n   \n   How glibly I reel this stuff off\n   \n  , Walton thought in amazement.\n  \n \n  Falbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check\neverything from now on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\"\n  \n \n  Walton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left\nvia a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube.\n  \n \n  Minutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a\ntowering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He\nremembered what FitzMaugham had said:\n   \n   Once we make even one exception,\nthe whole framework crumbles.\n   \n \n \n  Well, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little\ndoubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he\nhad done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling\nyou, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put him on.\"\n  \n \n  The screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had\ngiven way to wild-eyed tenseness.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Doctor?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll\nnever guess what just happened\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this\nmorning. And guess\u2014I mean\u2014well, one of them shouldn't have been sent\nto me!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card\nright here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is\nfine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great\nanxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet.\nSomeone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that\nthere's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us\nin half an hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say a word about this to\n   \n   anyone\n   \n  , not even the men in the\nexamining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents,\napologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for\nany future cases of this sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep\nbreath and stared bleakly at the far wall.\n  \n \n  The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law\u2014the Equalization\nLaw\u2014Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal\nas the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators,\nor the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor.\n  \n \n  He felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and\nthe Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done\nit, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position\u2014his life,\neven\u2014for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby.\n  \n \n  Well, the thing was done.\n  \n \n  No. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to\nfinish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant\nplaces and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's\nactivities.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred\nnever called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And\nWalton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this\ncall. No good at all.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Roy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of\nthe swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built\ncloser to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven,\nnext to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\"\nwith his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to\nFred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height.\n  \n \n  Even on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of\ntremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to\ntake shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What\ngoes?\"\n  \n \n  His brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here\na little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't\nhave time.\"\n  \n \n  Walton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's\nlapel, and refused to look anywhere else.\n  \n \n  Fred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Official business!\"\n  \n \n  \"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to\nbe using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was\ncurious\u2014unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of\nyour conversation with the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb.\nHe managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and\nsay, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek\ncomputer outlet is confidential.\"\n  \n \n  \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then. Eh,\nRoy?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much do you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't want me to recite it over a public communications system,\nwould you? Your friend FitzMaugham might be listening to every word of\nthis, and I have too much fraternal feeling for that. Ole Doc Walton\ndoesn't want to get his bigwig big brother in trouble\u2014oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks for small blessings,\" Roy said acidly.\n  \n \n  \"You got me this job. You can take it away. Let's call it even for now,\nshall we?\"\n  \n \n  \"Anything you like,\" Walton said. He was drenched in sweat, though\nthe ingenious executive filter in the sending apparatus of the screen\ncloaked that fact and presented him as neat and fresh. \"I have some\nwork to do now.\" His voice was barely audible.\n  \n \n  \"I won't keep you any longer, then,\" Fred said.\n  \n \n  The screen went dead.\n  \n \n  Walton killed the contact at his end, got up, walked to the window. He\nnudged the opaquer control and the frosty white haze over the glass\ncleared away, revealing the fantastic beehive of the city outside.\n  \n \n \n   Idiot!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   Fool!\n   \n \n \n  He had risked everything to save one baby, one child probably doomed\nto an early death anyway. And FitzMaugham knew\u2014the old man could see\nthrough Walton with ease\u2014and Fred knew, too. His brother, and his\nfather-substitute.\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham might well choose to conceal Roy's defection this time,\nbut would surely place less trust in him in the future. And as for\nFred....\n  \n \n  There was no telling what Fred might do. They had never been\nparticularly close as brothers; they had lived with their parents (now\nalmost totally forgotten) until Roy was nine and Fred seven. Their\nparents had gone down off Maracaibo in a jet crash; Roy and Fred had\nbeen sent to the public cr\u00e8che.\n  \n \n  After that it had been separate paths for the brothers. For Roy, an\neducation in the law, a short spell as Senator FitzMaugham's private\nsecretary, followed last month by his sudden elevation to assistant\nadministrator of the newly-created Popeek Bureau. For Fred, medicine,\nunsuccessful private practice, finally a job in the Happysleep section\nof Popeek, thanks to Roy.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Summary_1": "Fred Walton is the brother of Roy Walton, Assistant Administrator of the Bureau of Population Equalization. Fred Walton is a physician with a vaguely unsuccessful career history: medical school, a failed private practice, and finally becoming a doctor in the euthanizing section of Bureau of Population Equalization (or Popeek) thanks to his brother. Their childhood was tense and difficult. They were orphaned at 7 and 9 respectively when their parents died in a jet crash. Fred Walton and Roy have a very contentious relationship now, shown through Roy\u2019s hindrance to visiting his brother when in his section of the building. \nFred Walton is significant because he discovered what Roy Walton had done after breaking into the office computers and looking up confidential information. He uses his knowledge of Roy\u2019s felony and leverages it over his head. Essentially, he offers an ultimatum: Fred will keep quiet, so long as Roy does too. Plus, Roy now owes Fred. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Fred Walton is the younger brother of Roy Walton, the assistant administrator of the Bureau of Population Equalization (Popeek). The brothers are not close\u2014they have never been. Fred always told Roy he would get even with him when they were the same size, but he never caught up to Roy\u2019s height when they were younger. When they were seven and nine, their parents died in a jet crash, and the boys were placed in public care facilities. Afterward, they went in different directions, Roy to study law and Fred to study medicine. Fred had opened his private medical practice but wasn\u2019t successful, and Roy got him the job in the Happysleep section of Popeek. When Roy visits the Euthanasia Clinic, he asks if Fred is there but learns he is working on analyses, so he doesn\u2019t disturb him. Later, when Fred learns that Roy had been there, he is curious about what his brother was doing and requests a transcript of his work with the computer. Roy reminds Fred that doing so is a criminal offense, and Fred reminds him that makes the two of them criminals. Fred tells Roy he won\u2019t say anything about what Roy did and says they are even now. However, Roy now worries about what Fred will do. It is entirely possible that Fred will hold this knowledge over Roy\u2019s head in the future and use it to blackmail Roy. Fred undermines Roy's hope of getting away with what he had done.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Fred Walton is a doctor who works for the Bureau of Population Equalization, and is the younger brother of Roy Walton, the assistant director of the bureau. He is built bigger than Roy and over half a foot shorter. The two of them lived together with their parents until Roy was nine and Fred was seven years of age, but once their parents died in a plane crash, they led separate lives--eventually, Roy had gotten Fred his job with Happysleep, which reconnected them in some way. Fred noticed that Roy had been poking around the computer system when he visited the clinic, and took a look at what Roy had been doing. Fred confronted Roy about what had happened, which made Roy realize how dangerous of a situation this was, and that it could be escalating quickly now that both of them had committed criminal offenses.

        "Summary_4": "Fred Walton is Roy's younger brother, and he works as a doctor in the Euthanasia Clinic at Popeek. They do not like each other very much. When Roy was nine and Fred was seven, their parents died in a plane crash off Maracaibo, and they had been sent to live in a nursery. Roy received a law education and served as FitzMaugham's private secretary back when he was a senator. Fred studied medicine and spent some time in a failed private practice until Roy got him the job at Popeek. Fred is smaller than Roy at 5'7\" and compact. Roy believes that Fred's inability to catch up with Roy's height explains at least some of the resentment he harbors against him. When Fred calls him in his office after Roy returns from editing Philip Prior's record, Roy knows he is in trouble because Fred never calls unless he has something unpleasant to say. Fred reveals he had read through the history of Roy's use of the clinic's computer and suggests he knows exactly what he did to save Philip. However, he decides not to tell FitzMaugham because Roy had secured his position at the clinic for him. He decides to call it even."

        "Summary_1": "Philip Prior is the son of Lyle Prior and Ava Leonard Prior. He was born small, a little over 5 pounds, and carries the gene for tuberculosis. Within this new society, this genetic mutation means that Philip Prior has to be euthanized and sent to Happysleep. At only two weeks old, he has been sentenced to death. His father, Lyle Prior the poet, comes to the office of Roy Walton to try and save his son\u2019s life. Although he is unsuccessful at first, his words about what his son could become stuck with Roy and caused him to save Philip\u2019s life. Philip Prior is incredibly significant because his life and sentencing caused Roy Walton to make the first crack in the framework, commit a felony by saving his life, and potentially sentence himself to a failed career and life. ",
        "Summary_2": "Philip Prior is the two-week-old son of the famous poet Lyle Prior and his wife, Ava. With the Equalization Laws, all children have to be examined and tested at a clinic within two weeks of birth to determine whether they are healthy enough and genetically suited to live. If they are, they are given a certificate; if not, the certificate is denied, and the child is euthanized (sent to Happysleep) that day. Philip\u2019s test shows that he is 3f2, tubercular-prone. The child\u2019s father goes to see Mr. Fitzmaugham and then Roy Walton to plead for an exception for his son; Prior explains that he was tubercular when he was a child but that he was subsequently cured. He also reminds Roy to think about what would have happened to his poems if such a law existed when he was born and he had been sent to Happysleep. This thought haunts Roy after Prior leaves his office, and he decides to save Philip Prior, rewriting the child\u2019s medical records card and deleting his condition. The baby is minutes away from death when Roy takes the next step and visits the euthanasia doctor, telling him a fictitious story of a tragic mistake at a European center yesterday and implementing a new policy in effect immediately for checking each baby\u2019s file before operating on it. The doctor calls Roy shortly afterward and exclaims that one of the babies scheduled for Happysleep that morning was, indeed, perfectly healthy and should not be euthanized. Thus, Philip Prior\u2019s life is saved.\n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Philip Prioir is a two-week-old boy, the son of Lyle Prior, the poet who bursts into Roy Walton's office at the beginning of the story. The morning Lyle entered the Bureau, Philip had been committed to Happysleep. Lyle seems to think his son is in perfectly good health, but he has been labeled as potentially tubercular. This is especially shocking to Lyle because he had been tubercular when he was young, but was cured and not euthanized (because the euthanasia laws had not yet been passed). Roy Walton decides he needs to help save Philip, and goes on a secretive mission to do so. Walton changes Philip's record and then has the executioner in the clinic double-check all of the files, which prompts the executioner to think Philip is there by mistake. This lets Roy order him to send Philip back to his parents near the end of the story. ",
        "Summary_4": "Philip was born May 31, 2232 at New York General Hospital in New York weighing 5lb. 3oz. He is the two-week-old son of Ava and her husband, Melling Prize-winning poet Lyle Prior. Lyle had voted for the creation of Popeek and understood the concept of Weeding the Garden as well as the Euthansia Plan, but he hadn't expected his son would be selected for Happysleep. Therefore, when his son is selected because of a case of tuberculosis, he visits Roy Walton's office to request an audience with him. Lyle implores Roy to spare his son's life and reminds him that had the euthanasia program been around when he was a child, then his poems never would have been written for Roy to enjoy. Although Roy is empathic to Lyle's situation, he refuses to grant his request, knowing that it would cost him his job and perhaps the entire future of Popeek. However, after Lyle leaves, Roy is tortured by Lyle's argument, and he decides to grant Lyle's request. He makes his way to the Euthanasia Clinic & Files floor and accesses Philip Prior's record. After reading the denotations on the record, Roy removes the fatal symbol as well as the euthanasia recommendation from his record. Next, he visits Dr. Falbrough, whose jobs is to administer the euthanasia procedure. He tells Falbrough there is a new procedure designed to keep public opinion positive--prior to starting each procedure, the baby's file must be checked to make sure there is no mistake. In this way, he ensures baby Philip will not be killed. Roy ultimately risks his own career to save Philip's life."

Johnny claims he knows one of Lorelei\u2019s men is on Danae right now getting more supplies, so they could follow him back to their base. As he says that, Johnny saves Chip by throwing him to the floor and sacrificing himself. He is killed by an assailant with a scar on his face. Chip tries to save his friend, but the bartender rushes back in with a horde of people, claiming Chip is the murder. Chip runs away, chasing after the true killer, but loses him. He runs back to the Chickadee, and they quickly take off, even though the plating was only halfway finished. Syd and Salvation question him, and he explains the situation, as they follow the scarred man to the Bog, an extremely dangerous asteroid-ridden area. As Chip attempts to look through the perilens, a beautiful woman pops up, crying for help: the Lorelei. Chaos ensues, and they try to get her off their transmission, while a blast rocks the hull. The Chickadee crashed, and Chip wakes up to see a large man standing above him. He and his men question Chip about the ekalastron, but Chip won\u2019t reveal its location. The story ends with the pirate threatening to torture Chip. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Chip Warren, of the spaceship Chickadee II, is preparing for a solo night out on the asteroid Danae. Syd Palmer is a friend of his, and Salvation Smith is a missionary who handles a gun famously well: they warn Chip to be careful of the dangers of the Belt on his night out. Chip heads to the casino on the surface of the asteroid, passing members of many races as he heads to the small private bar in the back of the casino, empty except for a Martian bartender. As soon as he gets his scotch, someone bursts in yelling for Chip's arrest. After the bartender runs away, Chip recognizes Johnny Haldane, an old friend. They talk about Chip's recent discovery of an entire mountain's worth of No. 97, or ekalastron, a light and strong metal worth a lot of money. Instead of selling to anyone, Chip, Syd, and Salvation had sent a message to Earth about the cargo, and would handle the details later. Johnny is immediately concerned that \"the Lorelai\" may have intercepted this message--a pirate group much like the sirens who distract ships in the ocean, but in space. As Chip laughs at the idea of a mythical creature being involved, Johnny stops him to explain all of the related destruction that's happened in the past two months--only one person had escaped alive. Johnny explains that the ekalastron would be quite the prize for the Lorelai, and Chip needed to find protection. Chip reminds Johnny that his ship was being plated and could be indestructable, so they decide to go after the Lorelei together. Just then, there is an attack: Johnny is hit in the face with flame while pushing Chip out of the way. Johnny dies and the attacker flees when he hears footsteps, leaving Chip calling for help. Unfortunately, the Martian bartender thought Johnny's murder accusation had been serious, had gone to get help, and now assumes Chip is responsible for Johnny's death. A miner shoots at Chip, who runs to catch the real murderer to save himself. When he gets back to the Chickadee, he yells at Syd to get the ship moving, and spots the ship the murderer is leaving on. They move the ship as quickly as they can, and Chip catches his friends up as they fly towards the Bog, a region densely packed with asteroids. As they approach, they spot a phantom that is undeniably the Lorelei, calling for help. They try to modify their viewing equipment to get rid of the image, but she stays and keeps calling, and the ship was hit in the part that hadn't yet been plated. They are hit again and the men eventually pass out. As Chip comes to, he finds himself on the surface of a planet surrounded by pirates who laugh at him and explain that they want his ekalastron--they had intercepted Chip's message to Earth, but they still want to know where he got it.

        "Summary_3": "Chip Warren is going to celebrate discovering a mountain of ekalastron by drinking scotch while the other crewmen, Syd Palmer and Salvation Smith, stay with the ship. Chip enters a bar where he orders his scotch when the door bursts open and a voice yells for the bartender to grab Chip, stating he is wanted for murder on four planets. Terrified, the bartender flees the bar, and Chip faces his accuser, who is actually his old friend Johnny Haldane, a Space Patrol officer playing a joke on him. They talk, and Chip explains he is plating his ship with the ek they found. When Chip says they visiphoned Earth authorities they were bringing in a cargo of ek, Haldane stops him and explains how dangerous that is, warning he might have set himself up to be a victim of the Lorelei.\n       Chip believes the Lorelei is a myth, but Haldane tells him it is real. In the last two months, a dozen spacecraft have been taken, their crews murdered, and the cargo stolen. Haldane urges Chip to go back to Jupiter or Io with a Space Patrol escort, but Chip reminds him that his ship will be invincible. Haldane then encourages Chip to join him in Chip\u2019s spacecraft to take down the Lorelei together. Haldane is looking for one of the Lorelei\u2019s men who is on the asteroid for supplies and will follow the man to the Lorelei base.\n       Suddenly, Haldane throws Chip aside as a flame shot hits the scotch. The gun fires again, burning Haldane\u2019s face and killing him. Chip fires off a shot at the assailant, making him flee, and checks on Haldane, but the man is already dead. Then the bartender bursts into the bar with a mob behind him, pointing out Chip as the murderer wanted on four planets. He accuses Chip of killing Haldane since he is standing over the man\u2019s body with his flame gun.\n       Chip runs from the bar back to his ship and tells the men to take off right away. They haven\u2019t finished plating the ship with ek, but Chip needs to catch the assailant to prove his innocence. As they travel, Chip looks through the perilens and sees a beautiful blonde woman who motions for them to come to her. Her voice comes through the ship\u2019s audio, and she implores the men to help her. No matter what frequency he uses with his perilens, all he can see is her image. They are hit with a tractor-blast. Chip is stunned his ship is damaged, but Syd reminds him they hadn\u2019t finished applying the ek. When the ship is hit again, Chip slams into the instrument panel and loses consciousness.\n       Regaining consciousness, Chip is lying on the ground, surrounded by several men. The leader tells him they have unloaded his cargo and demands that Chip tell them where they found the ek, threatening to beat the information out of him if Chip refuses.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Chip Warren and his shipmates Syd Palmer and \"Salvation\" Smith dock at the Donae asteroid spaceport to refuel and allow their jerry-crew to plate the ship, the Chickadee II, with a protective layer of ekalastron--a powerfully strong, resilient metal of which the team had recently discovered a massive store which they planned to turn over to Space Patrol. As the crew work to cover the ship with the thin metal, Chip goes into the nearby town to celebrate his discovery. He finds Xu'ul's Solarest, a place where citizens from every planet in the Solar System could drink, gamble, and dance together; Chip, however, wants to be alone so he finds a quiet bar manned by a Martian bartender who gives him a bottle of Scotch. Soon, Chip's reverie is disturbed by a loud man accusing him of being a wanted murderer, which frightens the bartender into fleeing the room. Chip's accuser turns out to be his old friend Johnny Haldane, and they laugh and drink together as they catch up. Chip tells Johnny about his ekalastron discovery and about his intentions to deliver his cargo to authorities on Earth. As a Space Patrol officer himself, Johnny warns Chip that his communications with Earth may have been intercepted by the space siren Lorelei and her crew of pirates. At first, Chip shrugs off this suggestion, as he considers Lorelei to be only a myth, but Johnny reveals he is actually on Donae tracking one of her men. Remembering the protective qualities of the ekalastron coating his ship, Chip invites Johnny to join him on the Chickadee II, and they will hunt Lorelei and her crew together. After making this agreement, the two men are suddenly attacked, presumably by the man Johnny is pursuing, and he shoots and kills Johnny. Enraged, Chip flees the bar in pursuit of Johnny's killer with a horde of men tailing him, since the bartender believed Chip was the actual murderer thanks to Johnny's earlier joke. Chip runs back to the ship, and they begin their pursuit of Lorelei's man, despite the ekalastron coating being incomplete. Chip and his team realize they must catch the man in order to find evidence proving Chip's innocence in Johnny's murder. Along the way, they enter The Bog, a region of tightly packed asteroids, where Chip spots Lorelei through the ship's perilens. In an attempt to escape her broadcast, Chip exposes the Chickadee's location to the enemy ship, which quickly takes down the Chickadee II with a couple of crushing blasts. After Chip wakes up, he discovers he has been captured by Lorelei's people, who press him for information as to the whereabouts of the rest of the ekalastron. There is no sign of his shipmates."

        "Summary_1": "The Lorelei was first an ancient myth that plagued all spacemen. It was a Teutonic myth, similar to the sirens of ancient Greece, about a gorgeous blonde woman who combed her hair and sang to those around her. Her position on the rock lured all the men to their doom, as they would crash around her. That is where the Lorelei originated. In this turn of events, the story has evolved into a present-day pirating crew using the original myth to draw spacemen in. For the past two months, according to Space Patrolman Johnny Haldane, a pirate crew has a beautiful blonde woman calling for help to lure at least a dozen spaceships in before they kill the crew and capture all of their cargo. The pirates then turn on all of the control locks and send the empty ships back out, as they have no space for them in their current base. The Lorelei and her crew intercepted Chip\u2019s message about the ekalastron and set their sights on his ship as their next target. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Lorelei is what Chip refers to as a myth, which his friend Johnny insists is true. According to the original stories, there was a woman who sat on a rock in the middle of a sea distracting people who went by, like the classic siren myths. Johnny had been tracking some of the related crewmen and was investigating a lead when he ran into Chip. Johnny explained the two months of destruction that had occured, including the testimony of the one survivor found in the wreckage of a ship. This myth was being tied to a lot of pirating in the area, with particularly powerful ships. This is why Johnny didn't dare try to attack the Lorelei until he learned the Chip's ship had special plating on it that could protect them. In some sense, the Lorelei is both a myth and also a symbol representing a specific cluster of pirating. ",
        "Summary_3": "In literature, the Lorelei is an old Teutonic myth about a beautiful woman on a rock in the middle of the sea. She sings and uses her beauty to lure sailors to her where their ships are then destroyed on the rock. In the story, the Lorelei is a trap created by a group of pirates. They manage to fill spaceships\u2019 perilenses with the image of a beautiful young woman with a \u201ccome hither\u201d look about her, motioning for the ship to approach her. Her voice is projected through the ships\u2019 audio systems, and she entreats the space sailors to come to her aid. In the past two months, a dozen ships have fallen prey to the trap; the crews were murdered, the cargo stolen, and the empty vessels set adrift back into space. On one ship, however, a cabin boy avoided detection and lived to describe the Lorelei\u2019s appearance and the attack. When the Lorelei image appears in the Chickadee\u2019s perilens, Chip changes to a different frequency, but her image is on all of them; thus, the ship is flying blindly through space. This makes the Chickadee an easy target for the pirates to hit with their tractor-blast and take over. For Chip, though, the pirates know about his discovery of ek, so in addition to taking his cargo, they want to know the location of the remaining ek and plan to beat him until he gives them the information they want.",
        "Summary_4": "According to Chip, Lorelei is an old Teutonic myth about a beautiful, golden-haired damsel who sits on a rock in the middle of the sea, drawing in admirers to their ultimate doom. However, his space-cop friend Johnny informs Chip that the myth of Lorelei is very real, but instead of the middle of the sea, she makes her perch on an unknown asteroid in the middle of the Belt where she lures space-mariners to their death. Since she and her crew of pirates began attacking from the Belt, they have destroyed a dozen freighters, liners, and Patrolships, murdered their crew and stolen their cargo. Because she has no room on her hideout for ravaged ships, she locks the controls and sends them back into space as a kind of calling card. Johnny warns Chip that Lorelei and her crew will likely be waiting to ambush the Chickadee II as it passes through the Belt, and that is why they plan to join forces against her. However, one of Lorelei's men kills Johnny before they can, leading Chip to chase him down. During the chase, Lorelei appears on the Chickadee's perilens and entrances the men."

However, while there, he runs into Chip and makes a grand entrance, accusing him of murder. This causes the bartender to scurry away, so they sit and talk in private while nursing a bottle of scotch. After chatting for a bit, Chip reveals to Johnny that his crew found a mountain of ekalastron and they gave it back to the Space Patrol, as private users might have abused the material. All is well and good until Johnny hears that Chip used his visiphone to get in touch with Earth authorities, which Johnny immediately protests. Evidently, the Lorelei tracks people through visiphone messages and could have intercepted his. They decide to take on the Lorelei together, tracking the crew member back to their base and using Chip\u2019s newly-plated ship for protection. However, before they can move, a man comes in with a scar on his face and shoots at the two of them. Johnny saves Chip\u2019s life by pushing him out of the way but is killed by the blast. ",

He is friends with Chip, though they have not seen each other in some time. However, they have a friendly rapport, as he was the one who burst into the bar at the beginning of the story, accusing Chip of murder and calling for his arrest as a way to get his attention. He explains everything he knows about the recent attacks that the Loreli has been accused of recently, and they two of them decide to pursue the case together in Chip's fancy newly-protected ship before Johnny dies in a skirmish at the bar by the hand of a man with a scar on his face. Besides the information about the Lorelei, the other lasting impact he has on his story is his false accusation of Chip when he greets him: because everyone else took this seriously, it means Chip is being chased and accused of murder for the duration of the story. \n",
        "Summary_3": "Johnny Haldane is a member of the Space Patrol and an old friend of Chip Warren. He is a strong, brave man with a sense of humor. He startles Chip by bursting into the bar and jokingly yelling for someone to grab Chip because he\u2019s wanted for murder. Haldane is impressed to learn that Chip is plating his cruiser with ekalastron and learning of his cargo, asks if Chip will sell it on the open market. When Chip explains they turned the mines over to the Space Patrol at Uranus and visiphoned Earth about their cargo, Haldane informs Chip that he might be in serious danger from the Lorelei. At first, Chip thinks Haldane is talking about the myth, but Haldane explains about the Lorelei image luring ships that are then taken by pirates. The pirates take the cargo and murder everyone on board. Since it started two months ago, the sting has captured a dozen ships. Haldane urges Chip to change his plans and go to Jupiter or Io instead of Earth. But when Chip reminds him his ship is being plated with ekalastron, Haldane offers to deputize Chip to go after the Lorelei together. Haldane explains that one of the Lorelei\u2019s men is on the asteroid now picking up supplies; Haldane is trying to find him so he can follow him back to his base. Suddenly, Haldane thrusts Chip aside, and a flame shot smashes Chip\u2019s drink bottle on the bar. Another shot is fired into Haldane\u2019s face, killing him.\n\tLater, though, Chip\u2019s memories of Haldane help him. He remembers Haldane\u2019s strategy of plotting his prey\u2019s course, and when he is sure of the destination, taking care of him. Chip applies this strategy to the assailant he is chasing, rather than racing up and overtaking him. He wants to find the Lorelei and destroy it to protect everyone in space, in addition to capturing the assailant who can clear his name. It is also Haldane\u2019s warning of the Lorelei that enables Chip to respond without being drawn in by her beckoning. He knows the fate that awaits them if they approach her and immediately takes action that he hopes will prevent them from falling into the pirates\u2019 clutches.\n",

Johnny is in the casino when he sees Chip walking to the private bar, so he follows him there so the two can catch up. When Johnny enters the bar, he jokes that Chip is a murderer wanted on four planets, a joke the Martian bartender takes to heart after Johnny's death. When Chip and Johnny reunite, Johnny is impressed by Chip's discovery of ekalastron, and even more excited later when Chip offers to use his ek-coated ship to pursue Lorelei and her crew. Johnny comes to Donae in pursuit of one of Lorelei's men after receiving a tip about him traveling there on a supply run. After Johnny provides Chip with information about the truth of Lorelei's existence as well as her violent recent history in space, the two strike up the aforementioned plan to join forces and bring Lorelei to justice. No sooner is this plan hatched, than an unknown assailant--presumably Lorelei's crew member Johnny had been pursuing--begins shooting at the two men in the bar. Johnny sustains a blast to the face and immediately dies. Because of the joke Johnny had told earlier about Chip being a murderer, the Martian bartender believes Chip has killed Johnny. Angered and shaken, Chip pursues Johnny's killer with a horde of men close on heels who believe Chip is the actual killer."

I stand here\nwith an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I\nthought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a\nmyth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in\nthe middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks,\nwarbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.\"\n  \n \n  He grunted. \"A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this\nalleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad\nstory.\" He started to sing. \"'\n   \n   Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten\n   \n  \u2014'\"\n  \n \n  The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him.\n  \n \n  \"It's not funny, Chip.

She began exercising\nher vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since\nthen, no less than a dozen spacecraft\u2014freighters, liners, even one\nPatrolship\u2014have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been\nbrutally murdered, their cargos stolen.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Chip shrewdly. \"How do you know about her\nif the crews have been murdered?\"\n  \n \n  \"She has a habit of locking the controls,\" explained Haldane, \"and\nsetting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her\nhideout\u2014wherever it is\u2014for empty hulks. One of these ships was\nsalvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her\npirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He\ndescribed her.

The only\nthing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you\ncan get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes.

There was a clean,\nstarched odor.\n  \n \n  \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\npressed him back into the sheets.\n  \n \n  \"You're in a hospital.

You've been a\nvery sick man.\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked\naround him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\n  \n \n  \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\n  \n \n  The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He\nturned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n  \n \n  Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\nstand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\nmilky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n  \n \n  In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\nbefore he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't\u2014fool me. It's been\n   \n   more\n   \n  \u2014than three\u2014months.\"\n  \n \n  He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\nkept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\nout of them.

Dr. Arnold's voice went on\nafter a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.\nIt didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't\neven take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\nwhen a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\none time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\ndidn't hurt them, but it annoyed them.

        "Summary_1": "Ekalastron is the element No. 97 on the period table. It is an incredibly valuable material due to its properties. It\u2019s an incredibly light metal, and yet it is also impenetrable. Johnny claims that it\u2019s strong enough that a simple film of ekalastron would deflect an entire meteor. Of course, because of this, any amount of ekalastron could make a person very wealthy. Chip and his crew find an entire mountain of ekalastron on the chilly Titania, a satellite off of Uranus. They decided to turn over their find to the Uranus Space Patrol, and then let the Earth authorities know that they were bringing in some cargo. ",
        "Summary_2": "Ekalastron is a recently discovered element that takes up No. 97 on the periodic table. It is an extremely light metal that is also very strong and resiliant, so it could be worth a lot of money to the right people. Chip and his crew had found a mountain of it, which they had collected and begun to use to plate their ship to protect it from attack. The pirates who capture Chip at the end had intercepted Chip's message to Earth about the delivery of the shipment, but it seemed what they were really after was information on the location where Chip had mined this resource. This was worth far more, which made Chip realize he still had an advantage in the discussions.\n",
        "Summary_3": "Ekalastron (ek) is a recently discovered new element; on the periodic table, it is No. 97. Ek is extremely valuable due to its characteristics. It is such a lightweight metal that a man can carry enough in one hand to coat the entire hull of a battleship. Yet even the slightest layer of ek is strong enough to deflect a meteor. It is strong enough to crush the hardest materials but at the same time so resilient that it can rebound like rubber. A ship coated in ek will be invincible, so the element is highly desired by both government agencies and criminals alike. Chip\u2019s men have a cargo of it, and all three will be rich for the rest of their lives.\n\tThe element has far-reaching implications for whoever has it; in the wrong hands, it will enable criminals like space pirates to attack and plunder with impunity. In the hands of the government and the Space Patrol, ek will ensure the safety of public officers and officials, guaranteeing that criminal elements will never be able to damage their ships. It also ensures tremendous wealth for whoever owns it. The ek shows the true character of Chip, Syd, and Salvation; while they take enough for their own wants and needs, they turn over the balance to the Space Patrol of Uranus, providing that organization with the opportunity to benefit from it and preventing it from falling into the wrong hands. They also notify Earth that they are bringing a cargo of ek, presumably to arrange a private sale to the government or law enforcement, again keeping the valuable mineral out of the hands of those who would use it for unlawful gain.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Ekalastron, colloquially referred to as \"ek\", is a light, but extremely durable metal discovered in vast quantities in the fiery mines of Uranus' moon Titania by Chip Warren and the crew of the Chickadee II. The metal is so strong that even a small sliver of it is sufficient to deflect a meteor striking a ship. It can easily crush diamonds into ash. For all of these reasons, ekalastron is a highly sought-after and valuable element (Number 97 on the periodic table). After discovering a mountain of ekalastron within the mines of Titania, Chip and his crew turns the reserves over to Space Patrol authorities on Uranus and begin the journey back to Earth, where they plan to deliver their ship's cargo of the element. To protect themselves on the journey, they stop at a spaceport on Donae where a jerry-crew begins covering the ship with a thin coat of ekalastron. Johnny Haldane offers to deputize Chip as a member of Space Patrol when he realizes his ship has this level of protection, so that Chip may help him in his pursuit of Lorelei and her band of pirates. Johnny warns Chip that her crew may have already intercepted his transmission to Earth revealing the cargo he is carrying, and they might be lying in wait to ambush Chip on his way back home; therefore, the two have a shared interest in working together. After Chip is captured by Lorelei's men, they demand to know where the rest of the ekalastron stores are."

The God he worships is \"the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament,\" and Salvation sometimes resorts to strong-arm methods in bringing converts to his faith; he is quite gifted with a gun. Because of their affection for him, Chip and Syd call him \"Padre.\" When Chip returns to the ship to chase down Lorelei's goon who had killed Johnny, Salvation mans the gunnery turret and prepares for battle. When Syd wants to abandon the effort to catch the goon, Salvation stands with Chip, reminding Syd that authorities believe Chip was responsible for Johnny's death. When the goon takes advantage of the distraction employed by Lorelei, Salvation lets loose with the gunfire, shooting at an invisible target."

        "Summary_1": "The story begins with the Explorer ship landing on an unknown planet. The ships inhabitants are careful of any potential diseases and so do not readily disembark to explore their new surroundings. Instead, they send a crew of four medical doctors to go on a hunt party to understand the types of pathogens on the planet. The four doctors in the hunt party are June Walton, George Barton, Hal Barton, and Max. George and Hal are brothers. Max and June are in a relationship together. \n\nThey walk through the forest, shooting different animals that they encounter to test for diseases. As they walk through the forest, they encounter a man who speaks English. His name is Patrick Mead and he introduces the party to the planet, known as Minos. The man explains how his group was 300 miles away from their ship.  \n\nPatrick and the group asks questions of each other. Patrick notes that he is shocked to see a variety of different looking people as those on Minos all look very similar to each other. The group and Pat all head back to the ship where they explain to Pat that he has to go through a process of decontamination. They begin by taking specimen from Pat and spinal fluid samples from him. Pat then continues on to the rest of the decontamination process that the others do not have to go through. \n\nWhile Pat is going through decontamination, so is the rest of the doctors \u2013 but in a different process. During June\u2019s process, she is seen admiring her body. Once they are done, they go to the dining hall to eat. A woman asks the doctors when they will be able to let out of the ship to explore the new land, and Max answers that it might happen soon. Many people are excited about the possibility because they have all been isolated in space for the past year and a half. When they enter the cafeteria, they can hear passengers excitedly gossiping about Pat\u2019s arrival. As soon as pat enters the room, people approach him eagerly awaiting to talk to him. During the meal, Pat explains how a geneticist on the planet adapted the citizens\u2019 cells to their planet so that they would not destroy the planet foraging for food. \n\nDuring the conversation over food, Hall enters the room to inform them that the hamsters showed signs of infection. This means that Pat\u2019s people still do carry the disease, the morning sickness. Pat assures them that his people would be willing to be de-infected. The crew then send Reno Ulrich to go to Pat\u2019s town to make relations with the people.\n\nAfter eating, June goes back to the laboratory. She sees Pat and the beautiful Shelia Davenport walking in her direction. She mockingly acknowledges his presence when he walks past her.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "The hunt party of the 'Explorer' proceeds through a forest on planet Minos in spacesuits and communicates through earphones. The forest reminds Earth but can be dangerous, so the rest of the people stay on the ship, longing to be outside. At that time, the party of doctors is hunting animals to test for contagion, which has been the reason for massive deaths on other planets. Suddenly, an animal-like man, Patrick Mead, appears, who was sent by the Mayor from far away. The party is surprised to see an English-speaking human as there is no colony on Minos according to the map. Patrick informs them that the population of Minos is one hundred and fifty, and the planet has room for more. The variety of the group's appearances puzzles Patrick as in his opinion all people should look like June, a member of the party. She looks similar to Patrick himself - tanned, tall, with freckles and wavy red hair. He tells about a plague which happened in the past and killed everyone except the Mead families who were immune. As all the people alive are related, they look similar. The disease was called the melting sickness and it killed all the doctors before they studied it. The colony's ship went off forever to avoid the contagion and took everything with them. The party returns to the ship with Pat, considering the planet the desirable home. Pat admires the ship as he was raised on Minos without any luxuries or technologies. Max, June's boyfriend and also a doctor, tests Pat for the melting sickness before letting him into the ship. Reno's scout plane comes in surprise and is updated about the local colony. The newcomers have cureall, a multi-purpose cure from any alien intrusion to the body, but for safety the ship equipment for testings is fully mechanical. Pat's positive attitude is opposite to the usual ship talk and, therefore, pleasing for June. The passengers abroad are staring outside and stake places for their future houses. People are eager to meet Pat after a year and a half in isolation. Soon, he comes into the cafeteria and is surrounded by curious passengers. June becomes jealous of the female attention to Pat and compares him to Max, with the least significantly losing in appearance. Pat mentions that local food won't digest for the newcomers unless they are adapted by a test-tube evolution, a method used by his ancestor to avoid destroying the local flora but rather adapt the Mead's genes to local food. That leads to the inability to digest the ship's food, only the products of Minos. For some reason June feels fear. Hal comes and reports the hamsters tested before Pat was de-infected to be dead. Reno sets off to the colony to persuade the locals to be de-infected and to give their agreement through voting. The dead hamsters have nothing wrong in their bodies and the reasons are unknown. June sees Pat and admires him from afar. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story begins on Minos, an Earthlike planet where The Explorer has landed in hopes of colonization. The medical crew on the ship, consisting of June Walton, Max Stark, and Hal and George Barton, step outside with their spacesuits to hunt animals and test them for disease, cautious of potential plagues that could wipe out their ship. They surprisingly come across a human who speaks English, finding out that Minos had been colonized prior to their arrival. The man introduces himself as Patrick Mead. He explains that the population on Minos is small, only consisting of the Mead family, all which look alike. Pat goes on to tell the crew that a plague had struck the original colony when they arrived, called the melting sickness. The mysterious disease killed everyone except for the Mead family, and the people on Minos had tried to fly back into space for escape, but the crew never came back. The crew takes Pat back to their ship, and explains to him that in order to protect themselves against disease, tests and precautions are necessary. They run several procedures on Pat, including drawing his blood, bathing him in disinfectant, and injecting his blood into hamsters to see if he carried disease. June, having developed an interest in Pat, finds herself to be drawn to him as time passes. Dinner time eventually comes, and all the people aboard The Explorer eventually hear news of the new stranger. In the meantime, Reno flies a plane to and from the ship, carrying messages to the town on Minos. Pat arrives to the dining hall, and is immediately swarmed with interest and excitement. He tells stories of Minos and answers the many questions he is asked, and is given particular attention by the women on the ship, which June feels upset about. Len Marlow, a plant geneticist, listens as Pat tells him about food on Minos; when they had first arrived, they were unable to digest the plants and animals due to genetic differences. Their head of the clan, Alexander Mead, had managed to take human cells and adapt them to the life on Minos, ultimately allowing for them to eat and digest the food there. Pat implies that this process is necessary if the people on The Explorer want to settle on Minos. Hal Burton appears and informs the crew that three of the hamsters have died, and calls for the people on Minos to be disinfected. As June observes the hamsters, she walks past Pat, who kindly acknowledges her.",
        "Summary_4": "The medical party of the Explorer is going hunting along a narrow trail in the forest. June Walton asks if George Barton has gotten anything from his shot, and he says it looks like a duck. Hal Barton, his brother, says that the creatures won\u2019t look like ducks. Max tells June that he loves her and not to get eaten by a dragon. Many people wait on the Explorer spaceship to go outside, but it is up to the four medicos to hunt the animals and test them for disease. Someone fires at a specimen they see, but it turns out to be a man who has the three-day growth of red stubble. The man introduces the planet as Minos and says that the mayor sends his greetings from Alexandria. June is shocked to hear that after thirty-six light years of space travel, there is already a colony of one hundred and fifty living here. The man introduces himself as Patrick Mead, and he is shocked to see the wide variety of humans who have come from the Explorer. He mentions that there was a plague too, but it has disappeared, and there are no other illnesses. Pat goes with them back to the Explorer and admires all of the technology since he has been raised on Minos his entire life. When Pat asks to go abroad, Hal tells him that he must go through a few tests for melting sickness. Max performs various tests on him as Hal signals for Reno Unrich to drop a note in Pat\u2019s town to explain that contact has been made. Pat goes through more tests, which the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall called the Nucleocat Cureall could help ensure. June checks on Pat again and tells him that there will be a banquet after he has finished the tests. A Canadian woman named Bess St. Clair asks when the people will be let out. Max tells her that they will be going out soon because of the castaway colony. Bess is excited, and Max tells her that she can show Pat the way to the dining hall. Shortly after June and Max go into the dining hall, Pat appears and gets swarmed by a large crowd. They rescue him so that he can eat, but people come by anyway. All of the women linger longer, and June even begins to question her love for Max. Pat reveals that the people on Minos have been chemically adapted by Alexander P. Mead, who had turned human cells and made them into phagocytes. Eventually, these leucocytes are put back into humans once they have become successful. Hal then says that the colony people have the germs of melting sickness, to which Pat says that health is a top priority; the colony will need to vote on first, however. Reno is excited to study the people further, while June and George study the hamsters. As June wanders down the hall, Pat walks by, and they make contact. "

She ignored the brightly\nhumorous blue eyes.\n  \n \n  \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and\nme?\"\n  \n \n  Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin.\n\"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think\nthat people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit\nso many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I\nsuppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside\ndown!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits? The air\nis breathable.\"\n  \n \n  \"For safety,\" June told him. \"We can't take any chances on plague.\"\n  \n \n  Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the\nwind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take\noff the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins.\nMinos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.\n  \n \n  \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two\nyears after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead\nfamilies. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all\nrelated, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way\npeople can look.\"\n  \n \n \n   Plague.\n   \n  \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting\nsickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to\ndo about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for\nsome.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice.\n  \n \n  Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all\nthe books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion,\nand never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship\nwere indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone\nand machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace\nthem. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife\nand bow.\n  \n \n  \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton.\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other diseases?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a one.\"\n  \n \n  Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching\nawe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on\nthe intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"May I go aboard?\" Pat asked hopefully.\n  \n \n  Max unslung the specimen kit from his shoulder, laid it on the carpet\nof plants that covered the ground and began to open it.\n  \n \n  \"Tests first,\" Hal Barton said. \"We have to find out if you people\nstill carry this so-called melting sickness. We'll have to de-microbe\nyou and take specimens before we let you on board. Once on, you'll be\nno good as a check for what the other Meads might have.\"\n  \n \n  Max was taking out a rack and a stand of preservative bottles and\nhypodermics.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to jab me with those?\" Pat asked with interest.\n  \n \n  \"You're just a specimen animal to me, bud!\" Max grinned at Pat Mead,\nand Pat grinned back. June saw that they were friends already, the\ntall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a\nstab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being\nsmaller and frailer than Pat Mead.\n  \n \n  \"Lie down,\" Max told him, \"and hold still. We need two spinal fluid\nsamples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the\narm.\"\n  \n \n  Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed\nand inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine\nnerve surgeon on Earth.\n  \n \n  High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship\nand angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing. Then, suddenly,\nit veered and headed back, and Reno Unrich's voice came tinnily from\ntheir earphones:\n  \n \n  \"What's that you've got? Hey, what are you docs doing down there?\" He\nbanked again and came to a stop, hovering fifty feet away. June could\nsee his startled face looking through the glass at Pat.\n  \n \n  Hal Barton switched to a narrow radio beam, explained rapidly and\npointed in the direction of Alexandria. Reno's plane lifted and flew\naway over the odd-colored forest.\n  \n \n  \"The plane will drop a note on your town, telling them you got\nthrough to us,\" Hal Barton told Pat, who was sitting up watching Max\ndexterously put the blood and spinal fluids into the right bottles\nwithout exposing them to air.\n  \n \n  \"We won't be free to contact your people until we know if they still\ncarry melting sickness,\" Max added. \"You might be immune so it doesn't\nshow on you, but still carry enough germs\u2014if that's what caused it\u2014to\nwipe out a planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you do carry melting sickness,\" said Hal Barton, \"we won't be able\nto mingle with your people until we've cleared them of the disease.\"\n  \n \n  \"Starting with me?\" Pat asked.\n  \n \n  \"Starting with you,\" Max told him ruefully, \"as soon as you step on\nboard.\"\n  \n \n  \"More needles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, and a few little extras thrown in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rough?\"\n  \n \n  \"It isn't easy.\"\n  \n \n  A few minutes later, standing in the stalls for spacesuit\ndecontamination, being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant, bathed in\nglares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation, June remembered that and\ncompared Pat Mead's treatment to theirs.\n  \n \n  In the\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  , stored carefully in sealed tanks and containers,\nwas the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall. It was a solution of enzymes\nso like the key catalysts of the human cell nucleus that it caused\nchemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. Nothing\ncould live in contact with it but human cells; any alien intruder to\nthe body would die. Nucleocat Cureall was its trade name.\n  \n \n  But the cureall alone was not enough for complete safety. Plagues had\nbeen known to slay too rapidly and universally to be checked by human\ntreatment. Doctors are not reliable; they die. Therefore spaceways and\ninterplanetary health law demanded that ship equipment for guarding\nagainst disease be totally mechanical in operation, rapid and efficient.\n  \n \n  Somewhere near them, in a series of stalls which led around and\naround like a rabbit maze, Pat was being herded from stall to stall\nby peremptory mechanical voices, directed to soap and shower, ordered\nto insert his arm into a slot which took a sample of his blood, given\nsolutions to drink, bathed in germicidal ultraviolet, shaken by sonic\nblasts, breathing air thick with sprays of germicidal mists, being\ndirected to put his arms into other slots where they were anesthesized\nand injected with various immunizing solutions.\n  \n \n  Finally, he would be put in a room of high temperature and extreme\ndryness, and instructed to sit for half an hour while more fluids were\ndripped into his veins through long thin tubes.\n  \n \n  All legal spaceships were built for safety. No chance was taken of\nallowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him.\n  \n",

It is hinted that Pat\u2019s appearance prompted her examination. \n\nFurther, into the story, June begins to express more uneasiness with Max\u2019s figure. She also does not appear to like that so many women are giving Pat a lot of attention. She continues to feel guilty as she sees her feelings toward Pat as being disloyal to Max, who she thinks she loves. \n\nShe again shows her jealously when Pat is seen walking down a hallway with Shelia Davenport, who June herself describes as gorgeous. \n",

He is tall and handsome, especially on the contrast with her boyfriend Max, who is of the same height as she is and not handsome. She didn't care about Max's appearance before as she loves him, but presence of Max evokes some feeling of admiration in her. She is disappointed in how Max looks on the contrast. Pat also possesses a cheerful and gay attitude, especially on the contrast with the crew, which is tired of constant searching.

When Max asks if they are going to eat, she chooses to dial Pat first instead. June realizes that Pat\u2019s voice is full of vitality and enjoyment. After Pat is swarmed in the dining hall, June is very happy to have been the one who rescues him. She gets jealous when the other female specialists swarm the man. Even when she looks at Max again, he feels shrunken and shorter than before. She is angry at herself and feels guilty for doubting the love that she shares with Max, despite being immensely attracted to Pat.

Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ...

Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no.

Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The melting sickness is described as a type of plague by Pat. He informs the doctors that it arrived soon after the colony settled on the planet and killed all but one particular familiar which happened to be immune to the disease. The disease is described as being brutal and not even doctors were able to avoid it. According to Pat, there has not been any recurrence of the melting sickness and no other diseases to note. ",
        "Summary_2": "The melting sickness is the name the local colonists gave to some kind of a plague which killed all the colonists except the Meads families. It happened in a couple years after arrival and only the Meads turned out to be immune, that's why all the people on Minos look similar - they are related. The disease was so rapid and furious that it killed all the doctors and, therefore, wasn't studied. The rest of the colonists took off on the ship to escape, and left the Meads without any books or technologies, so they don't have doctors and hunt with bows. This disease is still carried by the Meads without harming them, it's also unable to record through testings - all the tests are good but the hamsters die.",
        "Summary_3": "The melting sickness is a plague that spread across the first colony on Minos. The melting sickness killed everyone except for the Mead family, who seemed to be immune to the disease. It is unsure what exactly the melting sickness is or its cure, because the doctors working to learn about it ended up dying during the plague. Since the, plague, there have been no more cases of the melting sickness on Minos, but the people on The Explorer still need to take precautions in case the germs prevailed. When the experiment is run on the hamsters, three of them die, one of them losing its hair. ",
        "Summary_4": "Melting sickness is the equivalent of a plague-type disease on Minos. Patrick does not know much about the melting sickness, but his father had explained it to him as being pretty gruesome. The doctors died too soon to find out what the disease was and what to do to cure it. It was also impossible to train more doctors or send them to civilization because their spaceship that served as a power plant with all of the necessary books went into the sky and never came back. Although Patrick says that there are no more recurrences of melting sickness, it is revealed that the colony peoples still carry the germs of the disease, which means that they must disinfect before establishing contact. The hamsters can fight off melting sickness alone, but the ones who died had strong shots of adaptive and counter histamine. George also says that they can not find any external micro-organisms. Everything present is leucosis and anemia; fever is only for the ones who fought it off. "

The doctors wear protective gear during this trip. \n\nWhen they bring Pat back to their ship, they require him to go through tests before he is allowed onto the ship.

        "Summary_2": "There is a protocol developed to prevent any danger. The ship has been to various planets and faced plague, so they are very cautious. The doctors exit the ship in spacesuits to explore the planet, while common people have to stay inside. The animals are tested on diseases. There are many laboratories and tools on the ship, even hamsters for experiments. There is a cureall stored aboard - a cure from any alien illness.

        "Summary_3": "In order to avoid any risk of contracting disease, people on The Explorer do not interact with foreign people or environments unless they are sure that there is no present disease that can be spread. Because of this, people on The Explorer have been in isolation. When the medical crew first encounters Pat, they are wearing spacesuits outside to protect themselves from the atmosphere, and before he boards the ship, they run several tests on him and make him go through several cleansing procedures. In order to find out if Pat has any diseases, they draw his blood and inject it into hamsters, running an experiment to see if there is cause for concern.",
        "Summary_4": "The criteria for safety that all members of the Explorer follow involves many tests and disinfecting. Before Pat can enter, they must first check if he carries the germs of melting sickness. Even when the doctors go on, they must stand in stalls for spacesuit decontamination. This decontamination involves being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant and being bathed in glares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation. The Explorer also houses the Nucleocat Cureall, a solution of enzymes that disintegrates any non-human cell. However, as an extra precaution, there are stalls that loop similar to a rabbit maze. There is an area for soap and shower, a blood test, solutions to drink, a germicidal ultraviolet bath, sonic blast shaking, germicidal mists, and immunizing solutions. After all of this, there is also a room with high temperature and extreme dryness; more fluids are also dripped into the disinfecting person\u2019s veins during this time. These are all necessary measures to ensure absolute cleanliness and destroy any chance of anyone being a suspected carrier of infection."

There are many passengers abroad, staring at the planet through the windows. There are cabins, a cafeteria, a control room, a library and laboratories inside. Before coming in, Pat is tested on the ground near the ship. The ship has a cureall - a cure from any disease. Not to get sick before it's used, then testings are done by machines. There is Reno's plane which travels with the news and notions. There are hamsters in one of the laboratories. From the view plate mountains, forests, hills and fields are visible. The ship used to have ballrooms and dining rooms but all was transformed. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story is set on Minos, a planet that Earthmen had found and landed on in hopes of finding a habitable place to colonize. Minos is visually and physically very similar to Earth, with forests, meadows, clouds, and breathable air. The animals are also similar to Earth animals. However, there is uncertainty about Minos, and risk of the planet carrying diseases that would kill the humans. Part of the story takes place aboard The Explorer, a large yacht-converted-spaceship. The Explorer is silver and black and towers over the forests of Minos, and inside the ship has several compartments, including precautionary medical rooms, staterooms, and a dining hall.",
        "Summary_4": "The story is set on the planet of Minos. The forest that the doctors trek through is said to be similar to Earth in the fall, but it is not fall. The colors of the leaves themselves are green, copper, purple, and fiery red. There are also patches of bright greenish sunlight and wind. On the planet, the small town of Alexandria is also there. The Explorer itself is converted from a yacht with a synthetic diamond-studded control board and murals. However, it does not have the newest speed drives. Inside of the ship, there are multiple stalls and rooms for disinfecting. There is also a locker room with shower stalls and a wall mirror. The room has a wall phone too. The Explorer has a viewplate, showcasing the outside landscape of mountains on the horizon. The low rolling hills are bronze and red, with patches of clear green in the fields. The cafeteria is converted from an old dining room, so it still has the original finely grained wood of the ceilings and walls. It also features sound absorbance, soft music spools, and intimate small light tables to eat at. There are trays to use to take food back to a table too. The ship has many working and living quarters as well, including a laboratory to do experiments in and study the hamsters. "

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story begins with Sim being born in a cold cave. He\u2019s wailing with tears while his mom feverishly feeds him. Even though he is a newborn, he interestingly has some self-awareness. Sim looked around the cave and spotted some old people dying in a graphic, grotesque manner. He raged in angst and his mom moved to soothe him. \n\nSuddenly, his father goes to attack him and his mother with a knife. His father wants to kill him as he reasons that there is no reason to live. Sim\u2019s mother begs him not to and tells him to have faith that their son might live longer. After this altercation, Sim notices his sister, Dark, for the first time. Afterwards, he notices that his mother goes through a painful process of aging. Sim cannot seem to find anywhere to look in the cave that is not horrifying to look at and cries himself at these revelations. \n\nBecause the people on this planet age incredibly fast, Sim goes through a lot of understanding and self-thought during the first day of his life. Eventually, the next day arrives. As an avalanche falls into the valley, Sim\u2019s father takes him and they both jump into the avalanche and are carried by it into the valley. Sim and his family enjoy the valley during the time that it is livable to play within its borders. During this time, Sim\u2019s mother and father become upset as there is a pressing realization that they both will die soon. They all hurriedly return back to their cave as the sun is coming out and would kill them if they are caught in its rays. A young child is caught in the sun\u2019s rays and burned to death. \n\nUpon their return, Sim\u2019s mother and father toast icicles to signify their last day. Throughout the day, Sim continues to grow and gain more intelligence. His mother feeds him and lovingly embraces him. Upon their mother\u2019s instruction, Dark takes Sim out into the valley and watches over him. While they are in the valley, the two parents die from old age. In the valley, Sim wonders why no one else asks about the metal seed in the distance that he sees. He thinks it is a potential escape plan. \n\nWhile outside, Sim observes meaning screaming a war rallying cry. When he finds a red berry, a boy named Chion goes and steals it from Sim. Dark slaps the boy and scolds him for stealing the berry. Sim thinks to himself about how he does not understand the fighting nature people have when life is already so short. He then threatens Chion and acknowledges the boy as his new enemy. Dark gives him advice about enemies and friends, how quick they can be made. However, Sim gets distracted with lustful thoughts about a girl that passes him. Dark mentions that she is concerned for his future as he will have to fight Chion. They then both run back to the caves. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Sim is just born in a cave, which is a nightmare. His mother feeds him and he grows larger and larger. There is a scary man in the farther corner of the cave, Sim's father with eyes being the only alive things on his face. Behind, the old people are sitting in the tunnel and dying. The father heads towards Sim with a knife to kill the child as there is nothing for him to live for. The mother disagrees and takes the weapon away. Sim's sister, Dark, is eating in the same room. The mother is also aging and dying. Sim understands everything though he is just one hour old and he is terrified. On the planet the days are flame, and the nights are ice, with dawn and sunset being the only bearable time to go outside. For that reason people live on the cliffs and they are about to die. Sim is about to live only eight days and all without sleep. Every age passes by really fast and people get old in days on the horrible planet. Ten thousand days ago metal seeds crashed on this planet bringing the people here, who rushed to hide in the cliffs and grew old in days. The only usable ship after the crash is still beyond the valley of cliffs, with some scientists working in it. Sim is determined to go there when he grows old and wise enough. At dawn, Sim's father takes him outside, leaps out during an avalanche and makes it alive. Fruits appear and as Sim eats, he rapidly gets knowledge. The mother cries for the transiency of time and wants to take the last look at everything, as they will die soon. The sun is rising but she is not afraid to be caught by it. Everyone rushes to the hideouts, including the family, but someone's child doesn't make it and is burnt. Sim glimpses the metal ship, his dream. Sim's parents are too feeble and send Dark to play with Sim at sunset, while they die. At dawn a funeral procession takes place for all dead during the night. Sim already can walk along. Dark and Sim discuss what they know when some people run to fight others. The kids are surprised as life is too short to fight. A boy, Chion, fights Sim for a berry. Sim understands what enemies and friends are, and the boy promises to kill him the next day. Dark explains how those are made and says that people around believe they can earn another day of life by killing the other. Suddenly, Sim notices and touches a girl, who he knows will become his wife tomorrow and they will be buried together. The girl introduces herself as Lyte, and along with Sim, Chion promises to remember the name. Dark tells Sim he needs weapons to fight for Lyte.",
        "Summary_3": "The story opens with Sim being born in a cave. He immediately  is aware of feelings and sensations and is introduced to the dreadful world his family lives in. Sim is fed fruits and grass by his mother as he grows larger, and he sees the others in the cave begin to die. As Sim's mother holds him, his father suddenly takes him and holds a knife to him, planning to kill him. Sim's mother pleads as his father wonders what he has to live for. Sim sees his sister, Dark, beside him, and his mother manages to grab the knife from his father. Sim soon begins to understand, through racial memory, the conditions he lives in. He understands that the planet he is on, on which the people before him had crashed, casts deadly radiation on the planet which causes the people on it to live for only eight days. The land outside the cave is too dangerous and deadly during the days and nights; only when it is dawn or sunset do the valleys bloom with nature and the people can enjoy its short life. Sim begins to age rapidly, aware of the eight days he has to live, and desperate to find a solution. He has a vision of a spaceship on a far out mountain, intact but impossible to get to, where a group of scientists struggle to find a way home. Sim longs to get to the ship and prolong his life. As dawn approaches, the people in the cave get ready to head down to the valley, where the daily Avalanche occurs; Sim's father recklessly takes him through the avalanche, barely surviving. Sim watches the valley become flooded with life as he gains more knowledge and understanding. As dawn fades, Sim's parents acknowledge that it is their last day of living, and everyone bolts back into the cave, a child being left behind and scorched by the sun. Sim's parents make a toast on their last day of life, and he watches them age until they are unable to walk and struggle to speak, while Sim himself notices his growth and ability. At sunset, Sim's parents are no longer able to go outside, and Sim says his first word, \"Why\". The next day, Sim's parents pass, and Dark becomes his caretaker. They frolic in the valley after the funeral procession, where Sim sees a group of men engage in war and is perplexed. He is then knocked to the ground by a child named Chion, making his first enemy. Dark explains that enemies are inevitable, especially due to the superstition some believe about gaining more days of life by killing others. Sim then notices a girl named Lyte, who he takes a liking to and acknowledges as his future wife.",
        "Summary_4": "Sim is born during the night. His mother feeds him with feverish hands as he realizes that he has begun the nightmare of living. As the thick fog clears, he sees a man with a dying face begin to approach them. His mother is fearful, but she continues to feed him things such as ice-nipples, pebble-fruits, and valley-grass. As his father approaches, people sitting in the tunnel all die. His father raises the knife over him and plans to kill him, but his mother flings herself upon the back of his father. He wants to kill Sim\u2019s sister too, but seeing his wife\u2019s state makes him change his mind. Sim begins to understand that he is on a planet next to the sun, with cold nights and hot days. Most of the people bring their children out during dawn and sunset to play because these are the only times the climate is bearable. Sim knows that he has exactly eight days to live. Sim feels that it is unfair that he only has eight days to live before he dies and wonders how the people have gotten into this situation. He gets flashbacks of a crash that brought men and women to the planet; their bodies are altered so that they live and die in a week. He tries to think about what he can do to save them and suddenly gets another image of a deserted spaceship on a low mountain. His father wakes him up to announce that it is dawn, and the Avalanche comes. As people push towards the dawn, the rocks fall too. His father lifts him up, and they narrowly avoid being killed by one. Dark runs ahead, and Sim wonders why there is laughing. Suddenly, he sees plants come to life and fruit begin to sprout, giving him new knowledge. His parents discuss how this is the last time they will see these sights again; the sun begins to rise again, and they all leave. Sim watches a young child running in the flatness, but the child dies before he makes it. His parents toast one last time, and Sim watches them age rapidly from one stage to another. Before dying, his mother tells Dark to take care of him. Sim speaks for the first time as his parents die. On the second day, there is a funeral procession for the people who have died the previous night. Dark and Sim go outside to see fifty young men go to war, which makes him bewildered as to why people fight when their lives are already so short. A small boy attacks him, and he introduces himself as Chion. Sim realizes that this is his enemy as Chion says that he will be big enough to kill him tomorrow. He sees his future wife named Lyte, and it seems that Chion is interested as well. Dark tells him to eat so he will be strong enough to fight. "

        "Summary_1": "The story begins at night when Sim is born. He and his family are inside of the cold cave. The cave had a thick fog in it that originally obscured his dad from view. The cave is where people on the planet spend most of their time. During the two hours of the day that they are able to venture out into the valley, they enjoy the beautiful scenery of greenery until they have to return to their cave tunnels. When the time is up, the sun returns and its rays scorch and kill everything in the valley. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story begins in a dark cave with a family within. The parents look old, the father threatens his newborn son with a knife, and the only thing the little boy and his sister do is eating. In the tunnel behind old people are dying. The planet is dangerous, it's extremely hot and the sun burns everything during the day, and the nights are cold with ice. Only at dawn and sunset the temperatures are normal and people can go outside. At these times the planet is beautiful and fruitful. When the sun appears or disappears the people hurry to the caves in the cliffs, otherwise, they die in a second outside. The temperature inside the caves is normal. There are metal pieces of seeds far away, most of the ships are broken, but one is known to be still functioning, though it's far away. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on an unknown planet near the sun. The planet has dangerous radiation and weather for the majority of the day, so much of the story is set inside a cave where humans seek refuge. The cave is barren and cold, made only of stone. At dawn and sunset, the people are able to go out into the valley, where plants grow, fruits bloom, rivers thaw, and animals roam. The few minutes of lush, natural life on the planet are cherished by the characters in the story, but they always return to the cave to avoid radiation.",

The ice thaws, and the fires die off too. All of the animals come out as well to enjoy what little life they can. There are avalanches, too, mostly consisting of stones that have been biding their time. In Sim\u2019s vision, there is a large metal spaceship just beyond the valley. He believes that it is the key to saving all of the people. When dawn comes, all of the plants flower, and pale green tendrils appear on rocks.

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame.

        "Summary_1": "Dark is the older sister to Sim. When both of their parents die from old age, on the eighth day of their existence, Dark takes over as a carrying role for Sim. She tries her best to impart knowledge to him about friends and enemies. Noticing the interactions Sim is having with other kids his age, she warns him about the violence that his future surely holds due to a new enemy. While she is not his mother and was not born much before him, she does take a protective role. She makes sure he is fed and defends him when he is being bullied. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dark and Sim are brother and sister. They have a one-day difference, which is a lot on the planet. As other children, they are constantly eating to get knowledge. While the parents are alive, the two are too little to be close. When the parents die, the leave Dark to take care for Sim. She teaches him what she already knows and they share their thoughts about the knowledge they gain. They become really close during the day without parents. Dark is a friend, while Sim already has enemies. She warns her brother and says him what he should do. ",
        "Summary_3": "Dark and Sim are siblings, Dark being one day older than Sim. Even when Sim is just born, he is able to see Dark and feel a connection with her, describing the feeling of their minds brushing. As Sim grows, he watches Dark model life for him. As they play in the valley, he notices the way she interacts with other children, and watches her eat in the cave. Though Dark is only one day older than Sim, time moves quickly, and she eventually must care for him when their parents die. She acts as a motherly figure to him, explaining life and making sure he eats and is protected.",
        "Summary_4": "Dark and Sim have a good sibling relationship. Dark is one day older than Sim, therefore making her age even faster than him. Before she dies, their mother tells Dark to look after Sim because he is younger. When their parents die, she holds Sim and cries. However, she does not disobey her parents and goes when they tell her to go play. Dark also does not let go of Sim, even when he tries to twist out of her grasp. She holds his hand during the funeral procession, and they stick together afterward. They chatter like birds, feed among the rocks, and exchange what they know about life. Later, Dark tries to break Chion apart from Sim and tells her brother that these enemies are made over small things such as food. She says that he must eat in order to defend himself and also catch up to Lyte. Dark is sad that her brother may very well have to fight for Lyte, so she tells him that he needs weapons. She worries a lot for her brother and always looks out for him."

        "Article": "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?\nImpressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and\nwe'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world\nwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\nit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\nstructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\nforty feet high.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n  \n \n  \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n  \n \n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\nplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\nTaphetta.\n  \n \n  \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n  \n \n  And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\nor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\natomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\nfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\naggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\naloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\nwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The planet is strange because of its extremes. The people that live on the planet have to spend most of their time in the caves because during most of the day the sun is too powerful and kills everything that it touches. At night, there is a cold, burning sensation. There are about two hours during the day, dawn and sunset, where the people are able to venture into the valley. During this time, the rivers flow, the flowers bloom, and the people enjoy the livable temperatures outside. Even more strange on the planet is the extreme aging that people go through. People only live 8 days. As a result, they mature, understand, grow, and age at an incredible pace. ",
        "Summary_2": "The planet is unadapted for humans. Originally, there were no humans on it, but their ships crushed there, so they can't escape. The sun on the planet is so hot during the day that it causes flames, so every plant is burnt in a second. During the night everything is icy and the temperature are so low, that they make everything freeze in a second. Dawn and sunset are the only times when people can go outside, at these times the planet is beautiful, full of fruits and plants. The caves are the only places for escape as the temperatures there are normal. People grow really fast and the life-time is eight days. In hours children learn to speak, to walk and to understand various concepts. The knowledge is gained through food. ",
        "Summary_3": "The planet is located very close to the sun. Because of this, the land is scorching hot during the day, making it impossible to be outside without being burned alive. The nights, however, are extremely cold, only permitting dawn and sunset for humans to be outdoors. Humans, having to adapt to the strange conditions of the planet, reside in the caves to hide from the climate, and their bodies were adjusted due to the radiation on the planet. The planet causes every human to grow rapidly and live for only eight days.",
        "Summary_4": "The planet causes people to age much faster than normal. From his vision, Sim sees the people drenched in solar radiation, which causes their pulses to quicken to a thousand beats per minute. Their blood changes too, and old age comes very quickly. Instead of a normal human lifespan, these people all live and die within a week while being forced to hide in caves. Another strange thing about the planet is its weather. There are only two hours of the day where life can function as normal, and everything must go into hiding for the rest of the time. Even the plant life cannot sustain itself, being burned away or frozen whenever dawn and dusk are over. "

His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "During his first day, Sim knows no words and has not yet spoken. Yet, he gains a lot of knowledge from images, old memories, and a telepathic type of awareness that seems to penetrate everything. He observes much of his surroundings and is upset by his analysis of the horror that occurs every day on the planet. On the second day of his existence, Sim readily and eagerly acquires more knowledge about social customs and how his society worked. ",
        "Summary_2": "Children on the planet are constantly eating as food is the source of knowledge. People grow every minute and the length of life is eight days. Sim gains initial knowledge while he is in the womb. When he can't even move, he already understands basic concepts like family, danger, etc. Every minute he gains some new knowledge. He says his first word in a day. He walks the next morning. He starts talking to his sister and she shares her knowledge as she is older. He makes friends and enemies the next day and fall in love. People are constantly dying before him. He sees the ship and dreams to reach it and escape. ",
        "Summary_3": "Despite Sim's young age, he is quickly conscious of the images around him, as soon as an hour after he is born. He is able to recognize his mother and father, and he soon watches as people in the cave die around him. Sim quickly grows accustomed to the concept of death and picks up on the idea that people only live for eight days. He learns by observing the people around him, watching as they go outside at certain parts of the day. Sim is also able to understand things through inherited memory, which allows him to comprehend ideas such as life. He learns to understand emotions such as love through his relationship with his family, and after his parents die, his sister Dark acts as his mentor.",
        "Summary_4": "Sim gains knowledge as the days go by. The moment he is born, he begins to start learning about the world around him. Since humans only live for eight days, he is able to learn how to walk only one to two days after his birth. Despite being a baby for the first part of the story, he already has very intricate thoughts about wanting to live longer and how it is not fair that all the people will die so fast. When his parents take Dark and him out, his senses are honed, and he begins storing knowledge intensely. Sim begins to understand love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage, selfishness, shadings, subtleties, realities, and reflections. Because of the lack of time, his mind seeks and interprets material on its own instead of having to wait for somebody to teach it new concepts. Just as his parents die, he learns how to speak. All of these changes seem to be the process of his short life. \n"

His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n  \n \n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n  \n \n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water.

Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen.

        "Summary_1": "Steve Cantwell grew up in a desert village on Sirius' second planet, he lived with his aunt. It is one of the human colonies, and it has never been accepted by the Kumaji tribesmen - the natives who have been raiding the settlements for years. Steve went to Earth to get an education, but now he came back to the planet. He flew from Oasis City to his native village on a unicopter only to find the deserted buildings and poisoned water. A Kumaji, who lived with the earthmen, tells him that the natives poisoned the well - three people died, and everybody else had to leave their home and walk to Oasis City through the desert wasteland. Now the Kumaji are looking for them to kill. The man stayed here to die since he\u2019s too old to flee or fight. Steve gives him his water canteen and flies away to find the other citizens. Hours later, he spots a caravan with camels. He first meets Tobias Whiting, who was the most successful man in the village when Steve was a child. The man greets him coldly and soon informs Steve that his aunt was one of the people who died from the poisoned water. Then he introduces him to his daughter Mary, the young woman who charms Steve. Tobias says he had a profitable business, but all his money is gone now. Three days later, he disappears, taking Steve\u2019s unicopter with him. The other members suppose that Tobias decided to trade the caravan\u2019s location for his profits, thus betraying them. Mary and Steve take some food and head towards the Kumaji base to the north of the caravan since Tobias probably decided to fly there. Four days later, they spot the empty unicopter and realize that Tobias must\u2019ve reached the base by now. They keep walking and soon surrender to the Kumajis, who put them in a circular tent where they meet Tobias. He explains to Mary that he wants to give her the life she deserves. Now he\u2019s determined to tell the Kumaji everything since his daughter got captured, and the Kumaji might torture her for information. Steve devises an escape plan: at night, he makes Tobias scream for a second to make one of the guards come in. Steve kills this one Kumaji, but the guard manages to lethally wound Tobias while fighting with the attacker. Whiting blesses Mary and Steve and orders them to leave, promising that he\u2019ll deceive the Kumaji and not share the true location of the caravan. The couple runs from the tent, and Steve kills several more guards before gliding off on the thlot\u2019s - desert animal - back with Mary. They reach the caravan two days later and decide to tell everyone that Whiting initially went to the Kumaji to save everyone. Mary admits to Steve that she loves him.",
        "Summary_2": "Steve Cantwell reaches a village after coming in his unicopter from Oasis City. He thinks about his childhood memories as he walks around, sadly thinking about living in the mud-house with his aunt after his parents were killed in a Kumaji raid, and the community center. As he tries the water, he realizes it is poisoned and stuffs sand in his mouth. As he goes into his aunt\u2019s house, an old Kumaji appears and tells him that everyone left. Steve thinks about the Kumaji raids from when he was a boy, and the old one talks about how the poisoned well was the last straw for the colonists to leave for Oasis City. Steve offers to take the old man with him in the unicopter, but he refuses and insists that the town is his home. Steve then goes to look for his people in the desert, and he finds them hiking through the desert. Steve goes to introduce himself again, but a man named Tobias Whiting only responds to him bitterly. He tells Steve that his aunt was one of the people who died, and his daughter Mary Whiting meets up with them later. Tobias Whiting complains about never having money because of the Kumaji, but Mary Whiting gives him a smile. Tobias disappears three days later, and he takes Steve\u2019s unicopter on the fourth night to go and retrieve his fortune. Mary slaps Gort, but he asks Steve how far Tobias will get with the unicopter. They get captured by the Kumaji and see that Tobias is waiting for them at the camp. Mary asks her father why he did what he did, and Steve asks if he has told them the information yet. At night, Mary asks if Steve has gone to sleep yet. Tobias is clearly asleep, and Mary is furious about her father betraying their people. Steve threatens to kill Tobias, but he ends up killing a guard instead. Tobias, however, is injured by the pike and lays there in pain. He asks Mary if Steve is the person she wants, and he tells the two of them to go south with the rest of the Earthmen. Tobias reassures them that he will live long enough to deceive the Kumaji. Steve escapes with Mary, killing a few more of the Kumaji before taking off on the thlot. They ride off into the distance, letting the sand obstruct their trail. Steve promises that they will tell the rest of the colony that Mary\u2019s father died as a hero, and she proclaims her love for him. The two of them know that they will reach Oasis City safely, and there is a new world out in space. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows Steve Cantwell, a young Earthmen who has returned from being educated on Earth back to his home in the Sirian desert. Upon arrival, he finds his village hastily abandoned - including his aunt - and the well poisoned. He finds an old Kumaji man in the community center, who informs him of what happened. The Kumaji tribesmen had raided the village as they felt the colony took up an oasis belonging to their own nomadic needs. By poisoning the well, the colonists were forced to travel by foot and camel across the arid desert to try and reach Oasis City, located 500 miles away. \n\nCantwell decides to hop into his unicopter to meet the travelling caravan and warn them of the Kumaji. He insists theres room for the old man, but the old man chooses to stay and die in his home. Reluctantly, Cantwell leaves the old man with the remaining water his in canteen. Later, Cantwell finds the caravan and reunites with familiar faces from his boyhood. This includes Tobias Whiting, previously the Colony's most successful man through his trading and business with the Kumajis, his daughter Mary, and some other childhood friends. Whiting describes how despite his relationship with the Kumajis and supposed riches, he and his daughter are forced to escape as refugees as well. \n\nDays after travelling with the caravan, Whiting disappears with Cantwell's unicopter. After discussing with some of the colony members, it is suggested that Whiting had gone off with the intention of trading with the Kumajis again: the colony's location in return for his money. Steve and Mary decide to follow and stop him. After a couple days travel, they find the unicopter crashed. Though initially reassured by the fact that Whiting was alive, they soon get spotted and captured by a band of Kumajis. Led to the Kumajis' encampment, they are met by Whiting. It seems that even if Whiting has changed his mind, the presence of his daughter and Cantwell could mean that the Kumajis were willing to torture the information of out Whiting regardless. \n\nAt night, Steve enacts a plan. He pretends to choke Whiting and draws the attention of the guard. They enter a scuffle, with the guard dying, but not without Whiting having taken a fatal stabbing from the guard's pike. Whiting vows instead to misinform the Kumajis on the caravan's location, and insists on the Steve getting Mary out safely. The pair manage to escape on a stolen thlotback and as they ride up to the caravan, plan to tell Whiting's demise as a hero.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The story revolves around Steve Cantwell, a human raised on a desert planet who decides to return home after years away.. When he arrives at his village, he sees the whole village is deserted, and attacked. The water well is poisoned, and the only person that he can find is an old man that tells him what happened. After overpopulation on earth increased dramatically, many humans turned to other planets to colonize. This desert planet was an example of that. The humans who lived in this village had always had trouble with the native tribe, as they weren\u2019t happy that the humans arrived at their home. This led to constant raids by the tribe, and is eventually what led to the humans abandoning the village to live in a city 500 miles away. After the old man told him what happened, Steve leaves in his ship to find the caravan of the surviving humans, as the old man wanted to stay in the village. After Steve finds them, he meets with people from the village, most of which remember him. Together, they continue their journey towards the large city and towards safety from the natives. One day, one of the men of the party takes Steve\u2019s ship. It is assumed that he wanted to negotiate with the natives, as he had a lot of money with them. In return, the man would give them the location of the rest of the humans. Steve and the man\u2019s daughter leave in order to find him and stop when. After getting captured by the natives, they meet with the man again, who wants to go ahead with his plan of betraying the rest of the humans. Steve understands that this can\u2019t happen, so he lures a guard in and kills him. In the process, the man dies, but manages to go back on his plan and sends the natives to a wrong location. Steve and the daughter leave, excited to meet up with the others and start a new life in the city. "

Two of the older folks had died of\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n  \n \n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter.

He, together with his daughter and other citizens, is forced to abandon his home and walk through the desert to Oasis City, leaving all his treasures and assets behind. The Kumajis are trying to chase them and kill the Colony. At some point in their journey, he meets Steve, who found the caravan on his unicopter. Several days later, Tobias decides to steal the unicopter and fly to the Kumaji\u2019s base fifty miles due north of their stop and trade the caravan\u2019s location for his money. He\u2019s kept in one of the tents, and soon Mary and Steve join him. Now that his daughter is a prisoner, he\u2019s eager to share the location of the caravan and save her from torture.

He also has a craggy and handsome face. Tobias used to be very rich, by the colony standards, because he primarily traded with the Kumajis. Now, he has lost all of his money to them. He deeply cares for his daughter Mary, taking good care of her when they have to flee with the rest of the colony. Tobias, however, decides to steal Steven\u2019s unicopter to go back to the Kumaji under the guise of getting his fortune back. When they meet him at the camp, he tells them that he is discussing a settlement with the Kumaji. Later, Tobias is gravely injured by the pike of the guard after he is attacked by Steve.

Despite this relationship with the Kumajis, he and his daughter were forced to escape with the rest of their colony. He remains bitter over the fact that wherever the colony escapes to, he and his daughter will be poor even with their supposed riches, which are tied up with a Kumaji moneylender. \n\nIn the middle of the journey, Whiting disappears with Cantwell's unicopter. It is deduced that he took off with the unicopter with the intention of informing the Kumajis, at a base not too far away, of the caravan's location in return for his money. Whiting successfully makes it to the Kumajis' base, and after running into his daughter and Cantwell, he remains steadfast on his decision because they might choose to torture his daughter for information.

Is the most callous\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n  \n \n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n  \n \n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n  \n \n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen.

I found it\nand brought it out.\"\n  \n \n  The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\nme,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n  \n \n  \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\ngot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n  \n \n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n  \n \n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n  \n \n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cansin\n   \n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n  \n \n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n  \n \n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n  \n \n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Selak\n   \n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n  \n \n  I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  He\n  took a walk.\n  \n \n  The town was just coming\nto life. People were strolling\nout of their houses, commenting\non the weather, chuckling\namiably about local affairs.\nKids on bicycles were beginning\nto appear, jangling the\nlittle bells and hooting to\neach other. A woman, hanging\nwash in the back yard,\ncalled out to him, thinking\nhe was somebody else.\n  \n \n  He found a little park, no\nmore than twenty yards in\ncircumference, centered\naround a weatherbeaten monument\nof some unrecognizable\nmilitary figure. Three\nold men took their places on\nthe bench that circled the\nGeneral, and leaned on their\ncanes.\n  \n \n  Sol was a civil engineer.\nBut he made like a reporter.\n  \n \n  \"Pardon me, sir.\" The old\nman, leathery-faced, with a\nfine yellow moustache, looked\nat him dumbly. \"Have you\never heard of Armagon?\"\n  \n \n  \"You a stranger?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thought so.\"\n  \n \n  Sol repeated the question.\n  \n \n  \"Course I did.

        "Article": "Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while.

The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n  \n \n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter.

        "Summary_1": "The Kumaji are the native tribesmen, and they have been raiding the Colony for many years. They also killed Steve\u2019s parents in the past. Now they poison the village\u2019s well, and his aunt dies from this water. They practically force the citizens to leave their homes and walk through the desert. The Kumaji are looking for the caravan to kill everyone else who remains alive. They have Tobias\u2019 money which upsets him and makes him initially betray his people and try to trade their location for his fortune. They take him, Steve, and Mary captive and then end up being unable to stop the last two from running away. ",
        "Summary_2": "The Kumaji\u2019s in the story are the main enemies of the colonists. They are the ones behind the raids, one of which killed Steve\u2019s parents. The Kumajis are also described to be significant because they are the reason why the caravan has to leave as quickly as they can. Even though the poisoned water is the last straw, the Kumaji are also out to hunt the colonists and kill them. They are also the reason why Tobias Whiting decides to go to their camp, in hopes of deceiving them so that the rest of the colony can reach Oasis City safely. Everybody mistakenly believes, however, that Tobias is planning to betray them for money. Even so, the Kumaji are the reason why Tobias can be regarded as a hero and have his moment to make the ultimate sacrifice.",
        "Summary_3": "In this story, the Kumajis are portrayed as the enemy. They prey on the defenceless villagers by poisoning the only water supply and doggedly chase after them in the arid desert. However, the presence of the Kumajis are significant because it could be interpreted that the Earthmen are the enemy instead, as we are told in the story that this planet was first inhabited by the Kumajis and the desert is actually a part of their land. This is attributed by the Kumajis' natural ability to survive in the desert, as well as their command over the thlotback desert animals. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Kumaji\u2019s are the native species in the story. They are very violent creatures, and constantly raid the colonies of humans in their country. They are described to be of a purple color, and seem to be very similar to the humans, except for the skin color. The Kumaji\u2019s are a very important part of the plot, as they are who drive the humans out of Steve\u2019s village and into a desert trek. Even after the humans left the village, they still wanted to hunt them down in their path to Oasis City."

        "Query": "\"What role does the old man play in HOME IS WHERE YOU LEFT IT?\"",
        "Article": "The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\n  \n \n  The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n  \n \n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave!\"\n  \n \n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n  \n \n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\n  \n \n  The old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\n  \n \n  He chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maota.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n  \n \n  \"You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\n  \n \n  Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\n  \n \n  The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "When Steve arrives at the Colony, he sees deserted buildings and realizes that the well water is poisoned. The old man - the Kumaji who lived with the humans - tells him that the day before, three people died from the poisoned drinking water. The Kumaji are behind this and are trying to locate the others who left the Colony. They want to find the caravan, and even though the desert wind will wipe out the humans' trail, they still need to be informed about this danger. Knowing all of this allows Steve to find the caravan and eventually save them from the Kumaji, who could learn their location from Tobias Whiting. ",
        "Summary_2": "\nThe old man serves as a guide for Steve in the story. Initially, he is the one who tells him about the colonists leaving because of the poisoned water. He also explains that the Kumaji are out to get them and that the colonists are desperate to get to Oasis City. His words also give Steve the motivation to go and help his people, despite being away for so long on Earth. Furthermore, the old man is also proof that Kumaji and humans can live together. Although he is a Kumaji, he has lived with humans and can speak perfect English. He does not hold any malice and even says that this is the only home he has ever had. Therefore, he will not leave this place and wishes Steve good luck to helping his people. ",
        "Summary_3": "The old man plays the role of the messenger. He has a strong role in the beginning of the story and sets up young Steve Cantwell with the background of what happened to the colony, as well as driving him with the mission of catching up to the travelling colony in order to warn them of the pursuing Kumajis. \n\nHe is significant because the old man, by face, is a Kumaji. Despite this, he has lived with the Earth colony and is insistent on dying in the village, which he proclaims as his town. This hints at the fact that Kumajis and the Earthmen could have actually cohabited peacefully, and even form strong bonds when their communities interacted and lived with each other.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The old man is a very important figure in the plot. After Steve finds his village abandoned and dead, the old man is the only one who stayed behind. He is also revealed to be of the Kumaji species, but he has lived with the humans in the village for such a long time that he has no ties to them. He helps Steve figure out what happened, and tells him where the people went in order for Steve to find them. He ends up staying in the village, even though Steve offered to take him to the others. He did this because he was already dying, and wanted to die in his village. "

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to\na waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat.\nHe looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under\nthe night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the\nmoon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.\n  \n \n  He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised\ndamp fingers to his mouth. Salt.\n  \n \n  He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly,\nuntil he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him,\nand shut his eyes and mind to everything.\n  \n \n  Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came\ndown on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to\nher, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they\nwere which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing\nhim again.\n  \n \n  It was getting light. His head was splitting.\n  \n \n  Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in\ntown....\n  \n \n \n   Town!\n   \n  He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east,\nto the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him\nright down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find\nout what was happening.\n  \n \n  He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until\nshe broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.\n  \n \n  Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately\u2014a long time\nlately?\n  \n \n \n   The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by\nflooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where\nthere could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where\nthat ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons.\nAnd after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of\nCrossville. And after that....\n   \n \n \n  He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here\nhe was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could\nit be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to\nforget things he'd known all his life?\n  \n \n  He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was\nbeyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on\nthe road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard.\nThere'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his\nfamily and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks\nheard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared.

        "Summary_1": "The plot follows Sol, a veteran of the U.S. army who, after picking up a hitchhiker on the way to a wedding, gets his car robbed near a small town. He ends up staying in the house of a young family who are kind enough to host him. They are very nice with him, and even offer him breakfast the next morning. As Sol learns more of the town and the family, he learns that the people in the town share the same dream every night, in a place called the Armagon. He also learns that there was an execution last night in the same place. He follows Willie Dawes, the head of the family, to pick up the body of the person that was executed. They are also accompanied by the sheriff of the town and by a man named Charlie. When Sol sees the body of the executed person, he starts to get worried and starts asking people in the town questions about the Armagon. That night, Sol stays with the Dawes family again, and when he goes to sleep he meets with the townspeople in the Armagon, where it seems that he will be executed. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Sol Becker meets a woman at the doorway who looks like a mom from a homey cartoon. She is confused by why Sol is at her door, and he explains that he is a hitchhiker going to Salinas. She lets him come into her house, where he asks if he can stay the night. She explains that he does not have to pay and rushes back upstairs so she will not miss the execution. Sol goes to sleep and is woken up again by a little girl named Sally. He asks what time it is, but Sally responds that she likes poached eggs. Sol desperately tries to get her to leave, but Mom sends her away. Sol tries to call Fred but is met with indifference; a man named Willie Dawes offers to take him to the sheriff as Mom finishes breakfast. They talk about Armagon during breakfast, which is a place that everybody dreams about at night. Sol asks about the execution again, but Dawes tells him to eat his breakfast. They enter a wooden building to meet Charlie, and Dawes mentions that they are picking up Sheriff Coogan too. As they discuss with the other people, Sol realizes that everybody dreams about Armagon. Charlie is the Prince Regent, and they meet the sheriff too. The men go to the shop to find Mrs. Brundage, who is in grief because of her husband. Sol tries to ask what had happened in Armagon, but Mrs. Brundage refuses to tell him. Everybody is more worried about Mr. Brundage, so Sol goes on a walk and tries to ask about Armagon. Everybody says that it is none of his business, so he has no choice but to stay in the town until his car is found. Sally comes home at five thirty and asks if he is going to stay, and Mom refuses to hear anything about pay. Sol tries to ask Mr. Dawes for some more information again, but he refuses to say anything. When Sol goes to sleep that night, he finds himself awake in Armagon. Sally, Mom, and Mr. Dawes have returned wearing much finer clothing, indicating a higher status. Charlie asks if this is the snooper, and Dawes tells him that he should round up the knights. Sally screams for execution, and the knights begin to appear. They point the tips of their sharp spears at him as Sol wonders if he will ever awake.",
        "Summary_3": "Sol Becker was driving to the wedding in Salinas - his old army friend Fred was getting married. Late at night, he picked up a hitchhiker who minutes later pushed Sol out of the car and drove away, leaving the man soaking near an unknown village. He knocked at the door of a village house, and a woman - he called her Mom - let him in. Sol briefly told her what had happened, and she allowed him to sleep on the couch. Anxiously whispering that she would miss some execution, Mom went upstairs, leaving Sol confused but grateful. He got woken up by a little girl named Sally, pestering him with awkward questions - Mom told her to stop and get ready for breakfast. Minutes later, he found a telephone and called Fred, who didn\u2019t seem very upset by the news of Sol probably missing the wedding. After hanging up the phone, Sol talked to a man called Dawes, who promised to take him to Sheriff Coogan to report the car theft after breakfast. Mom called out that the breakfast was ready. Sally told Sol about Armagon - a place both parents and the daughter dreamt about every night. She also started talking about some execution, but Dawes coldly refused to answer Sol\u2019s questions about this. Before meeting the sheriff, Sol and Dawes crossed the street and picked up a man named Charlie or, as Dawes said, Prince Regent. As they were marching down the street, they met a woman who, Sol eventually realized, was also dreaming about Armagon. They finally came to the sheriff\u2019s house. He listened to Sol\u2019s story while they all were walking to a barbershop to pick up the body of a man called Brundage. They saw a crying woman - the wife of the dead, and Sol again made an attempt to understand who got killed and why. Soon, they came back with the body and told Sol to wait while they were carrying it somewhere else. Sol took a walk and again tried to ask citizens about the mystery place from their dreams but didn\u2019t get much information. He then went back to the Dawes residence. A State Trooper asked him some questions about the car and told him to remain in town until further notice. Sol ate lunch, walked for a bit, and returned in the evening. Sally - the daughter - clutched his leg and then started telling him about her day. Mr.Dawes came later and asked Sol about his questions to the citizens and then wondered if the man was a reporter. After a quiet evening, they all went to bed. Sol fell asleep and suddenly realized he was somewhere else, surrounded by marble pillars. He saw Sally running around in a white toga, then the sheriff chasing her. He finally saw Dawes dressed as a king who welcomed Becker to Armagon. The king unexpectedly asked Charlie to round up the knights, and Sally started triumphantly screaming: \u201cExecution!\u201d. Sol asked them to stop, but the knights kept approaching. ",
        "Summary_4": "Sol Becker, an engineer whose car is stolen by a hitchhiker on his way to Salinas for his friend\u2019s wedding, asks for a stay in a house. The owner of the house is a family with parents and a kid. On the first night when Sol makes himself in the house, he sleeps in the living room and notices Mom of the family hurry upstairs to join a court. The following morning, Sol is woken by their daughter, Sally, who asks him weird questions. After Mom orders Sally to leave Sol alone to let him dress, Sol borrows the phone to talk to his friend, whose wedding he will miss. After that, he meets Mr. Dawes, the father of Sally, and they eat breakfast together.\n\nAt the table, Sol learns that the family dreams of going to the same place called Armagon every night, where there is a palace, and execution happens there. After breakfast, Mr. Dawes takes Sol to seek Sheriff Coogan. On their way, they meet Charlie, who is called Prince Regent. Charlie joins them, and they find the Sheriff. They go to a barbershop, where the owner\u2019s wife, Mrs. Brundage, is sobbing because her husband died. The three men from the town go into the house and carry the corpse out. Sol tries to know the truth by asking Mrs. Brundage, but he is scolded for not being respectful. After seeing the men deal with the corpse, he takes a walk in the town. During his walk, Sol realizes everyone in the town dreams of going to the same place every night. He learns little about the place. When he gets back to the house, he is allowed to stay for one more night. At night, after he falls asleep, he finds himself in a palace where Sally and Charlie are playing. When Mr. Dawes finds him, he orders Charlie to gather the Knights. The Knights surround Sol, and he realizes that he may not be able to wake again, just like Mr. Brundage.\n"

        "Summary_1": "Willie is the head of the family that hosts and helps Sol after his car was stolen. He seems to have a lot of influence in the town, as he helps the sheriff in his day to day tasks and everyone in the town knows him. He is described as a tall and skinny man. He is also married to Mom, which is the woman that first received Sol after his car was stolen. Together she and Willie have a child called Sally. At the end, it is revealed that Willie is actually the king of the Armagon, which is why he has so much influence in the town. ",
        "Summary_2": "Willie Dawes is the husband of Mom and the father of Sally. He is a tall and rangy man, with a bobbing Adam\u2019s apple and a lined face. When he first meets Sol, he is sympathetic to the man\u2019s situation and tells him that they can go see the sheriff after breakfast. He is also very caring towards his family as well, always eating with Mom and Sally at home. He is very quick to correct Sally\u2019s mistakes as well, when she mispronounces Armagon and execution. However, although Dawes seems friendly, he can turn cold when provoked. Whenever Sol asks about Armagon, Dawes responds coldly and changes the subject. He is also cautious around Sol too, believing that the other man is a reporter who is here to expose the secret of the town. However, Dawes later shows an authoritative side too, donning magnificent attire and living up to his title as a King. ",
        "Summary_3": "Willie Dawes is the head of the Dawes household, Mom\u2019s husband, Sally\u2019s father, and, apparently, a king of Armagon. He seems relatively friendly and approachable when he first meets Sol and promises to take him over to the sheriff. Dawes is rather outgoing - a lot of citizens know him. Still, he is very protective of their town\u2019s dream of Armagon. So whenever Sol asks about this place or the execution, Dawes becomes cold, stern, and uneasy. He plainly refuses to answer the first questions about it and then later makes sure Sol is not a prying journalist who wants to write about Armagon. Dawes also seems rational and emotionless when it comes to Armagon\u2019s laws and those who breach them. For example, he pragmatically approaches the death of Vincent Brundage, who got executed for breaking a rule, and considers his punishment necessary.  ",
        "Summary_4": "Willie Dawes is the owner of the house where Sol Becker, an engineer who loses his car on his way to a friend\u2019s wedding, borrows for a stay. He is called \u201cPa\u201d by his wife, and he often calls her \u201cMa.\u201d Mr. Dawes is tall and rangy. He is short-tempered, and whenever Sol asks about the dream place, he tells Sol to mind his own business coldly. He gets annoyed by Sol\u2019s questions often. Mr. Dawes walks so fast that Sol has to try hard to catch up with him when walking in the town. Mr. Dawes seems to make a speech in the dream place the first night that Sol stays in their house. He goes to the barbershop with the other two men, carrying Mr. Brundage\u2019s corpse, who seems to die of a heart attack. He seems to be the king in the dream place, where he wears magnificent attire."

She is very helpful to Sol, but she also makes it clear that she isn\u2019t going to go out of her way to help him more, like he has to sleep on the sofa and that breakfast is at 7. ",

Mom is very kind, instantly welcoming Sol inside of the house and letting him sleep on the couch. Although she apologizes about the temporary accommodations, she is kind enough to refuse any form of payment from Sol. Mom is also a very good cook, as she is in charge of making all of the meals in the house. Despite Mom\u2019s kind side, she is also a strict parent towards Sally. She often tells her to stop annoying their guest and tells her to brush her teeth before anything. Mom also looks out for the other townspeople too, giving Mrs. Brundage a phone call after her husband is executed. When Sol reaches Armagon, Mom is wearing regal scarlet robes and scolding Sally to give the sheriff his helmet back. ",

She allows Sol, a total stranger who knocks at her door at three at night, to sleep on their sofa and gives him a towel to clean himself. She makes him breakfast in the morning and refuses his money. Mom asks Dawes to help Sol get to the sheriff. She also decides to call Mrs. Brundage after her husband Vincent gets executed to express her condolences. She is a relatively good mother who can handle Sally\u2019s rebellious nature and also a rather generous host who feeds her entire family and Sol every day. ",

She wears a fussy, old-fashioned nightgown when Sol Becker, an engineer who lost his car on his way to a friend\u2019s wedding, asks for a stay. She welcomes Sol to stay in their house and lets him sleep on the sofa. She is a cheerful woman when preparing the family\u2019s meals. She is always busy in the kitchen, and she often educates Sally, her daughter, about not doing something inappropriate. She is strict with Sally. Sometimes, she gets confused between day and night because she goes to the dream place every night. In addition, she is a sympathetic woman because she remembers to call Mrs. Brundage to comfort her after the loss of her husband.

        "Summary_1": "The dream of the townspeople is what makes the town unique, and what puts Sol in danger. At the beginning Sol thought that the Dawes family shared a dream, but then he learned that everyone in the town had the same dream every night together. Also, the dream is a courtroom style, where Dawes is the king and can execute people. Charlie, the fat man that helps Dawes, is one of the knights in the Armagon. At the end, Sol attends this shared dream and it is implied that he is going to be killed by Dawes and the others. ",
        "Summary_2": "The dream of the townspeople is significant because it transports all of them to Armagon. Whenever they dream, they can go to an alternate reality that is completely different from the town. It is also worth noting that people, such as Dawes or Sally, suddenly become royalty whenever they dream. The townspeople also dream of the town every night, and it is considered to be a town secret that should not be easily told to anybody else. Since Armagon is their world, the townspeople all fulfill their roles in it. Some of the faces become knights, while others are in positions of power and have control over these forces. Anything that does not happen in the daytime, such as trials or executions, are also held in Armagon which is part of the dream. It is also important to note that anything that happens in the dream, even death, can possibly happen in real life as well. ",
        "Summary_3": "The dream of Armagon connects all the townspeople. They all go there every night, every time they fall asleep. It\u2019s another reality with marble pillars, purple draperies, and a new hierarchical system in which Dawes is the king. This place has another set of rules and is as significant for people as their daily life. They value this dream and protect it from strangers, like Sol. It seems to be interconnected with reality because Vincent, who committed a crime in Armagon and got executed, also dies in real life, though from a heart attack. It interests Sol who tries to learn more but always faces passive aggression from those who are not eager to share the secrets of Armagon. At the end, he is being surrounded by the knights of Armagon and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to Sol later.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The dream of the townspeople is Armagon, a palace with marble pillars supporting a high-domed ceiling. The wall is decorated with purple draperies, and the room is wide and long. Townspeople seem to be the Knights of the Realm in the palace, and the Dawes family appears to be the royal family. Every night, townspeople dream of going to this same palace, which confuses Sol Becker, an outsider who lost his car. Sol tries to find out what this dream place is throughout the story, but the townspeople do not tell him a lot. Sol learns on the first morning of his stay at the Dawes' house that there was an execution the night before, in which the executed person seems to be the owner of the barbershop, Mr. Brundage, who died of a heart attack. Sol questions around the town, where he learns little about the place. In the end, Sol also gets into the dream place, where he is about to be executed, too. The dream of the townspeople is a secret that the protagonist tries to find out throughout the story, but when he finally gets there, it seems that he may also lose the ability to live in the future."

He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences.

He desires but cannot divorce her as the law and society are critical of the divorce. His colleague, Harry Folsom, suggests he get an illegal Ego Prime, a technology that can produce a human duplicate possessing all the human features and functions, after he becomes fed up with his wife after a fight over his new secretary. He goes to the black market, goes through all the examinations needed for the technology, and buys a Super Deluxe Prime, George Prime, to hide in his workshop in the garage. The workshop is his sanctuary that he keeps for years after a long fight with Marge, a place where Marge cannot go in. He sets up George Prime and orders it to pretend him whenever he goes out to have some extramarital affairs with women in his office. George Prime does an excellent job on that as it behaves completely identical to George Faircloth, except that it gives Marge Faircloth more pleasure than George Faircloth does. At first, George Faircloth enjoys the freedom of playing around with women and not having to worry about Marge\u2019s hysteria. But after a while, as he realizes that Marge has been more mellow and sweet whenever he is at home, catching George Prime on the street once when it is not supposed to be outside according to his order, he starts to suspect whether his choice is correct or not. One day, he leaves his date and comes home early, seeing George Prime have sexual affairs with Marge. Gripped by the anger, he tries to recall George Prime coming back to the garage, but it doesn\u2019t respond due to the lack of the first logical opportunity for it to return. After that, through the conversation with George Prime, he realizes that things are out of his control as he cannot decide specifically what George Prime will do. Even worse, he finds out that his money is spent through the signature of George Prime as their signatures both have legal effects, and that he cannot call the police to fix it as he couldn\u2019t explain the situation of illegal George Prime. George Prime and Marge Faircloth leave for Bermuda with his money. Marge comes home when he feels desperate in his house and comforts him. He soon realizes that it is not Marge Faircloth but Marge Prime, his wife\u2019s duplicate and that his wife had already found out his trick long before. In the end, George Faircloth lives happily with Marge Prime, and Marge Faircloth lives happily with George Prime. Both of them are satisfied with the duplicates as they would satisfy their needs in the marriage.",

He describes her as emotional and grumpy. He also calls her jealous and brings up the story of when she fought with him because of his new female secretary. His friend Harry Folsom suggests  buying an Ego Prime - an android that fully resembles the person it was built after, including the feature of speech and mannerisms. The sale of this mechanism is heavily regulated by the law - having a personal Ego Prime with open circuits is illegal, but George feels desperate. He comes to a four-storied warehouse near Broadway meets a little man, a consultant who, after a quick chat, sends him to a laboratory where they can copy George\u2019s appearance and behavioral patterns. Two hours later, Faircloth meets his android duplicate George Prime, who later gets delivered and stored in the big closet in George's workshop - Marge never comes here. After supper, he switches on George Prime, lets him go to the house, and leaves for a date. During the following weeks George leaves at night after switching with his duplicate. He usually uses the android several days a week and puts him back in the workshop closet when he returns. Soon George realizes that his wife has become happier and calmer. George Prime claims that he was simply paying attention to her, listening - that\u2019s why she changed. George thanks him. The next evening, Faircloth unexpectedly meets the duplicate at the liquor store and becomes angry, but George Prime says that he had to get bourbon for Marge and was in no position to refuse. Faircloth decides to stay home the next night and has a strange conversation with his wife, after which he decides to go to bed. The next night, he activates George Prime and goes to the movies alone. Once back, Faircloth sees his wife and the duplicate kiss. He walks to the workshop and pushes the recall button waiting for the android to come, but George Prime appears only at dawn. The next morning, George gets a call from the bank and learns that someone who appeared to be him has been cashing checks for the last weeks, and now his account is empty. He calls one of the city travel agencies and learns that George Prime just bought two tickets to Bermuda. Apparently, Marge has spotted the substitution and convinced the android to purchase the tickets. George comes back home, but no one is there. Suddenly his wife opens the front door, her arms full of groceries. She tells him that she figured out everything but was not planning on running away with George Prime. She sent him back to the factory. George becomes suspicious and soon understands that it is a duplicate of Marge standing in front of him - his real wife did run away. \n",

One day, one of his coworkers tells him about a new technology that allows him to buy a perfect robot replica of himself.

George uses the robot to stay at home with his wife while he goes out with different women. George is very happy with how his life is going, and he also starts to notice that his wife is much happier than before.

He finds Marge complaining, whining too much and picking up on every little detail he does that does not go her way. Because of the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968, divorce was never an option for them as taxes charged on it are too high.At work, George envies his co-worker, Harry Folsom, who is equally not in the happiest relationship but is allowed to gets away with traveling away from his wife. Marge is easily jealous. George has an affair with his new secretary, Jeree, which Marge finds out about and calls George out over dinner. The next morning, Harry advises George to get an \u201cEgo Prime,\u201d a clone android of one\u2019s self that looks and behaves just like the real person.

As time went on, George noticed something different: Marge became softer, nicer, cooking him dinner with music he likes. George Prime tells him he has just been telling her the right things. George Prime starts getting out of control as he makes his own decisions like going to the liquor store or spending intimate time with Marge overnight. George unexpectedly starts to crave Marge and cancels on his date. As he gets a call from the bank informing him about checks that were made to his account, he realizes Marge has known his tactic all along, and has been using the android to get what she wants, a trip to Bermuda.

She tells him she knew all along and realized she never fully appreciated the real him. From hugging her and feeling the depression button under her hair, he realizes Marge has also been using a Prime.

        "Summary_1": "The Ego Prime is a technology that produces a robotic duplicate of a person. This duplicate is based on a neuro-pantograph with a humanlike body and soul. The duplicate is identical to a real person, including the habits, thought processes, physiological functions, or even the handwritten legal signature that one person may have. The only difference between the real person and one\u2019s duplicate is that the duplicate has a finger-depression button hidden underneath the hair above the ear.

However, he finds out that George Prime leaves with her wife, and his wife, Marge Faircloth, sends her duplicate Marge Prime to accompany her, just as he did to her. The exchange of their duplicates to escape from the unsatisfying marriage contributes to most of the story. Prime technology plays a significant role as duplicates can satisfy human needs better than a natural person. Due to this characteristic of being able to meet one\u2019s demand by their logical inferences and inability to feel annoyed, the duplicates of both sides become the ideal mates for each person, both George and Marge, ending the story with both of them living with the Primes.

However, when he finds out that George Prime, his duplicate, gets along better with his wife than him and finally leaves him behind together, he realizes what he has done wrong. When he feels desperate, his wife\u2019s duplicate comes to stay with him, and he finally finds his wife\u2019s duplicate better than his wife.

After trying to fix it in every way possible, George is hopeless and gives in to the idea of getting an \u201cEgo Prime,\u201d a android clone of him that would look and act like him, allowing him to lead a joyful parallel life as the android directly deals with his wife.\n\nFirst, the story gives a social commentary on the concept of marriage. With the couple being trapped in such a long unhappy marriage, even after trying to fix it yet not finding any way out of it, the story showcases the unnatural aspect of marriage as a social construct. Two individuals are bound to live life together but yet are not able to get out of it because of an imaginary societal contract they agreed upon and societal norms that would view such action as dishonorable. Instead of finding other ways other than a divorce, which they could not afford, to fix it, they thus put up with living together unhappily. This leaves the reader questioning whether marriage should truly limit two individuals\u2019 freedom to this extent.\n\nThe story also gives a commentary on the nature of a good marriage. As the story goes on, George\u2019s Ego Prime starts to turn Marge into a softer, nicer woman, who George starts to appreciate more. George Prime gives credit to this change in behavior to his choice of saying the right things, in other words, the things Marge wants to hear. Equally, when George finds out the Marge he has been falling for again is merely a Prime too, he still accepts and wants her as she makes him feel appreciated. These intentions make the readers question the selfishness behind the concept of marriage. Do we agree to a marital contract purely for our own selfishness of wanting to be serviced and on some level, praised? Are the nice actions we do for our partners merely to selfishly receive those same actions back?\n"

Marriage is great. It's a good old red-blooded American\nInstitution. Except that it's got one defect in it big enough to throw\na cat through, especially when you happen to be married to a woman\nlike Marge\u2014\n  \n \n  It's so\n   \n   permanent\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Oh, I'd have divorced Marge in a minute if we'd been living in the\nBlissful 'Fifties\u2014but with the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968,\nand all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women got\ntheir teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved Spouse\nCompensation Act, I'd have been a pauper for the rest of my life if\nI'd tried it. That's aside from the social repercussions involved.\n  \n \n  You can't really blame me for looking for another way out. But a man\nhas to be desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime.\n  \n \n  So, all right, I was desperate. I'd spent eight years trying to keep\nMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.\n  \n \n  Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes\nand a shape that could set your teeth chattering\u2014but that was where\nthe dream stopped.\n  \n \n  She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long\nenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she was\ncrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chilling\ndetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,\nwhich happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a \"beastly\nheadache\" (for which I was personally responsible) and the other half\nshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time we\ngot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "George Faircloth and Marge Faircloth are husband and wife. They have married for 8 years. Their relationship is toxic and unsatisfying. George is fed up with Marge\u2019s constant complaints, grievance, and crying. Marge is unsatisfied with George\u2019s inattention to her and his possible affairs with women in his office, so she often spies on George\u2019s office life, which irritates George more. They are constantly in fight. Their way of communicating with each other is to attack and fight, and they haven\u2019t seen each other carefully and sweetly for a long time. Their relationship is to conquer and be conquered repeatedly, fighting all the time.",
        "Summary_2": "George and Marge Faircloth have been married for eight years. George claims that their life is full of scandals and distrust. They fight ninety percent of the time. Marge is often complaining, crying, or criticizing George. She is jealous, and once when a new secretary started working with George, she threw a tantrum and spoiled the evening. Marge doesn\u2019t get enough attention from him and knows that he can be indecent. They both do not enjoy living together, and George finds it easy to buy the Prime android and spend his evenings with his female colleagues. At the end, Marge and George end up with the android duplicates of their spouse and feel much happier. ",
        "Summary_3": "The relationship between George and Marge is very tense. It seems as if in the past they had a great relationship, but now they just fight. George states that they fight almost every night, and that it is very hard for them to spend time together without there being something that Marge complains about. It is also clear that George doesn\u2019t try to make Marge happy anymore. Both of them quit the relationship and instead bought prime androids so that they could have more freedom outside of the marriage. ",
        "Summary_4": "George Faircloth and Marge Faircloth are a couple that have been engaged for eight years. They are trapped in an unhappy marriage where George feels trapped by a wife, who although he finds stunning, does not stop complaining, crying and whining about the most unnecessary issues of their coupled life. The two have tried to make the marriage better but never yet succeeded. They were never able to consider divorce as an option because the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968 charges incredibly high taxes on the process. Marge is also a jealous wife which makes George feel even more suffocated. Marge finds out that George has an affair with his secretary, Jeree. In the story, George finds a solution to this unhappy marriage by purchasing an Ego Prime, an android clone of himself that looks and behaves like him, so that he can go on about his life as the android deals with the coupled life for him. In the first stage, this android brings him lots of joy as he is able to meet with his secretary and other women as he pleases. Then, as he notices that his wife gets more tender and more caring, he starts appreciating and missing her more. By the end of the story, he finds out that Marge knew his trick all along and that she booked herself a trip to Bermuda with his money. Marge also had a Prime of herself, who is the real person George has in fact fallen for.\n"

Harry\u2019s wife is equally not easy to deal with but the difference was he would always get away with leaving to Rio every now and then with a stenographer. He plays an important role when Harry comes to him for advice the day after Marge finds out about Harry\u2019s secretary, Jeree, and their affair. Over coffee the next morning, Harry is the person who jokingly suggests George to get an Ego Prime, selling him the idea of freedom from a wife, to which George initially declines because of how it is illegal. Still saying that he is joking, Harry confirms that with the right contact, George could get one of those androids at a decent price. After successfully convincing George, Harry recommends one of his contacts to him. Following his advice, George finds himself meeting an agent with a mustache from the black market for Primes, who from then took on the responsibility to create George\u2019s Prime.

        "Summary_1": "Kaiser is a young man who was unhappily married and decided to join space service to escape his wife and her brother. He was on the mothership, Soscites II, that was finishing its planet-mapping tour. The team put him in a scout ship and sent him to the planet he calls Big Muddy. During the landing, the scout\u2019s bottom bent inward and flattened the fuel tube. At some point, Kaiser finds himself lost because he doesn\u2019t remember what was happening in the last hours, only the fact that he must fix the scout during the next few weeks. He reads the message tape with the mothership and learns that he had a swollen arm, a fever, periods of blankness, and in the middle of the exchange, he started using baby-talk. Now Kaiser feels better and asks for some information on fixing the scout from the mothership\u2019s team. Then, he walks around the scout, looks at the \u201coctopus\u201d testing the environment of Big Muddy, and heads toward a sluggish river and native seal-people. They are short, with the body of a seal, thick arms, and thumbless hands, and have mammalian characteristics. The man spends some time observing them and then looks at their domed buildings. Soon the mothership informs Kaiser that he has probably been invaded by a symbiote, though it is not supposed to harm him. It\u2019s adaptable and tried to give Kaiser what he emotionally desired. Hours later, the team adds that the symbiote can accurately gauge his feelings, and he needs to test this. Kaiser makes a shallow cut - it immediately heels, his sensory perception improves, and now he can control how humidity affects him. He spends a day trying to repair the scout and then leaves for a day walking trip. He meets another group of seal-people. They seem more advanced than the first ones. Kaiser sleeps in a tent and, in the morning, swims with the natives until one of them starts playfully drowning him. He comes back to his ship and realizes that his physical strength has improved. Kaiser manages to partially fix the metal bottom and report the events of the day to the mothership. They tell him that the natives probably have the symbiote and then order him to repair the ship as soon as possible. In the morning, they repeat that he needs to leave very soon, which puzzles Kaiser. The captain sends an angry message with the order to finish repairing the scout. Kaiser goes to the river and takes the communicator with him. The natives look almost human-like now and use syllabism. A female native invites him to the river, but Kaiser hears that the communicator received a message. He walks back and reads that the team has a suspicion the symbiote can alter Kaiser\u2019s mind. The second group of seal-people was not more advanced - he just became more like them. The man destroys the communicator and follows the girl to the river. ",
        "Summary_2": "Kaiser is busy trying to figure out the strange communication from the tape in his hand, but he is also annoyed by the rainy climate outside. He tries to think back to the baby talk but finds it hard to even remember what he was doing here. Kaiser knows that he has to repair the scout ship, or else he will be stuck here forever. The mothership, Soscites II, has set itself into orbit around the Big Muddy ship, which is why he only has a month to repair the ship. The message he sends from himself is about the seal-people and repairing the scout ship, and the ship responds with a message about how this information has been given to Sam. He responds with a list of his symptoms, and the ship asks for more information. Kaiser wonders why some of his messages are sending in baby talk, but the ship says that everything is perfectly legible. However, after the last message, he does feel better and sends another one to the ship for more information. Kaiser dreams about his wife Helene and their loveless marriage, waking up in a cold sweat an hour later. He decides to go outside, observing how the octopus part of the scout ship is busy sending everything to the mothership. Kaiser goes to visit the seal-people again, and they chirp when he comes close. Some of the seal-people come up to him, but the smell of fish is too much for him to bear. He finds that they are a mindless lot and decides to explore the round domes. For the rest of the day, Kaiser tries to figure out how to fix his scout ship because the Soscites II sent little to no help. The ship tells him that he has been invaded by a symbiote, but it is not dangerous because the symbiote will die with Kaiser if he dies. It also explains the baby talk, as the symbiote was trying to give him what it thought he needed. It is revealed the crew does not like him much because he is intelligent and not prone to mistakes. Later, he accepts that he will live with the symbiote and goes to observe the seal-people again. This new group seems more advanced than the other, and they even give him seaweed as a gesture of friendship. Kaiser goes to swim the next day, and the locals are extremely friendly as they try to play with him in the water. When he goes back to his ship, he finds equipment and begins to put work into repairing the scout. The mothership sends him messages to come back, but they deliberately conceal information.  He also finds out that the seal-people are becoming more human like now, and a female even stays to watch him repair. During his last communication with the ship, he smashes the communicator and joins the female as they run to the river bank to play. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows Kaiser in his scout ship as he is grounded upon Big Muddy. He is temporarily separated from his mother ship, Soscites II, as the mothership takes an orbit around the planet. Kaiser is grounded because his scout is broken, and he does not have the appropriate equipment to fix it. \n\nIn his communications log with the mother ship, it is revealed that Kaiser had fallen ill.  After he recovered, he took a trip to observe the seal-people. They had been swimming and eating by the river bank and paused in curiosity as Kaiser approached.  Alongside the riverbank lay a few hundred dwellings - round domes built with mud bricks. \n\nUpon receiving more information from the ship, Kaiser and the crew find out that the symbiote is harmless to humans. Any of his prior illnesses was perhaps the symbiote adjusting his body to the new environment and correcting any subsequent mistakes it may have made. In addition, the symbiote can only know what Kaiser wants by reading his mind. At this theory, the crew urged Kaiser to perform his own tests to see if it was true. He tested this theory by changing his body temperature and checking that the room temperature stayed the same, and confirmed it to be true. \n\nKaiser then took another trip,  hoping to find more intelligent natives. He found a group of seal-people that seemed more intelligence in their actions and has less of an odor to them. The next morning, he went swimming with the seal-people and they crowded around him in a friendly manner. However, their overeagerness to play nearly caused Kaiser to drown, and so he headed back to the scout. There, he accidentally turned a sled and found the equipment. He was able to concentrate and fix part of the scout using his mind and tools. As he sent off the news to the ship, he read his messages. \n\nIt appears that Big Muddy undergoes two drastic seasonal changes - extreme moisture and aridity. As a result, the seal-people must be able to physically adapt in order to survive. SS II informs Kaiser that it is due to the natives also having symbiosis, and that all efforts should be devoted to fixing the scout and returning home. Though noting the urgency behind the messages, Kaiser still chose to take another trip to the river banks. This time, he noticed that the seal-people looked almost human and he could detect syllabism in their speech. \n\nIn a frantic last message from the ship, Kaiser learned that the symbiotes have already begun altering Kaiser in more sinister ways. His perceptions on finding seal-peole becoming more intelligent and human-like wasn't actually because of that, but because he himself was becoming more seal-like. The symbiote is able to alter his mind and physical state, and already has. After reading the message, Kaiser picked up a rock to destroy the device, and happily returned to the girl on river bank and they swam in the water. ",
        "Summary_4": "The story follows Kaiser, a human who gets stranded on a new planet. He is a part of a space expedition, and after his ship crash lands he only has one month to fix his scout ship and return to the large ship. He can communicate with the large ship using a typing system, and it is revealed that he has been communicating with the crew because he had been feeling sick. Kaiser also interacted with the natives of the planet, which are described to be seal-people. The ship\u2019s doctor informed Kaiser that his symptoms most likely come from a symbiote which inhabited his body, but that there is no reason for concern, as the symbiotic relationship can help both the symbiote and Kaiser. Kaiser struggled with this news for a while, but then realized that it could be a good thing. The symbiote allowed Kaiser to control his feelings better, and even helped him physically. Kaiser then went on a journey to a new village of the natives in order to search for tools that could help him repair the ship. Here, he interacted very well with the natives, and felt happy doing so. After coming back, he realized that the symbiote was giving him extra strength and managed to repair the ship. When the ship told him to immediately come back, he started to doubt his desire to go back. He went back to the original village of the seal-people, taking with him a transportable communication device. He seemed to be very happy with the seal-people, having fun and interacting with females. The ship sent him a message telling him that there is a lot of urgency in his order for Kaiser to go up, as the symbiote was adapting his body and mind to the planet. Kaiser responded to this message by breaking the communication device and going back to the river with the seal-people. "

He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes.

Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n \n \n \n   He was something out of a nightmare but his music was straight\nfrom heaven.

Ludwig\n  \n \n \n \n  Illustration by Kelly Freas\n  \n<doc-sep>It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\nbecause I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me\nunhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\nPlanets make me feel wretched.\n  \n \n  The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\ncalves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on\na piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\nand little grubby things just looking for\n   \n   you\n   \n  to crawl on. If you\ncan think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty\nimagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells\u2014I've\nbeen on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\nnot for me.\n  \n \n  We have a place in the Ship like that\u2014the Third Level\u2014but it's only a\nthousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\na level or down a level and be back in civilization.\n  \n \n  When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\nsea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\nhills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\ndon't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\ngear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\nsmarting from the slap I'd given him.\n  \n \n  In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\nJimmy\u2014if he would get back alive.\n  \n \n  It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\nnearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\nlike fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\n  \n \n  Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow\nfor fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\ndo figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time\nyou're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\nthe Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\nis a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\nsomething has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\nfrom decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\nkeep the population steady.\n  \n \n  I began to check my gear out\u2014sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\nfound at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\nVenie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\ngetting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\nlanding, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't\nhave anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the\nbad moment any longer.\n  \n \n  The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\nand in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\ncolor of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the\nlights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\nthe dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\nif it's really going to come back. But I lived through it\u2014one day in\nthirty gone.\n  \n \n  I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\nthings in mind\u2014stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\nThe first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\nI could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\ncamp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\nthough not with that meatball Jimmy D.\n  \n \n  No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take\nnothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from\nnobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\n  \n \n  I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November\u2014too close to\nYear End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\nspring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\nback we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\nlook forward to.\n  \n \n  In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\nanimals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\ngood, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\nbest meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I\nwondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\nthey've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good\nthat I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\n  \n \n  On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\nhillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\nit in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\nhard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\nof horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't\nidentify.\n  \n \n  One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\nthey dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\nactual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\nEarth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\nestablished, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\ndraft animals.\n  \n \n  The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\nas well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\nelse in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\nwere planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that\n   \n   could\n   \n  have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\nhad to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll\nbet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Kaiser left Earth on a mothership Soscites II, that soon, finishing its planet-mapping tour, approached a planet that the man named Big Muddy. He left the spacecraft in a small scout ship - which had a pilot chair, a communicator, and a bunk - and landed on the muddy surface. The other seven scouts got lost during the previous exploration of new worlds. It is wet, humid, and warm on Big muddy, constantly raining with different intensity. There is a wide sluggish river, which has the shape of a horseshoe, two hundred yards away from the scout and also a chain of hills. Farther, along the stream, there is a group of several hundred domed dwellings, built of mud blocks, packed with river weed and sand. Another group of seal-people lives near the riverbank in the opposite direction of Kaiser's first observational walk. ",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on a planet that Kaiser has named the Big Muddy. It is extremely wet, warm, and humid. There is also a village of seal-people nearby, and they have huts alongside the river bank. Kaiser\u2019s scout ship has places for controls and also to sleep. In the village, there are also round domes that were based on construction of a series of four arches in a circle. The climate also changes on the planet, which is why the seal-people change as time goes on. Although it rains a lot in general, there are seasons where it rains less than the others. This is evident because the domes are built by river weed, mud, and sand. Even though the seal-people do not know how to use fire, it is evident that there must be times where it rains less in order for them to build these domes. ",

The landscape includes many river banks where the natives spend time, and the ground is often muddy and slippery. \n\nAlongside the riverbank, there are also two hundred dwellings. These dwellings - round domes - are constructed from bricks built from a dried combination of mud, river weed, and sand. The dome was built by constructing four arches ranging in a circle, with the roof forming the final layer. \n\n",

The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n  \n \n  Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n  \n \n  The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n  \n \n  Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n  \n \n  Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n  \n \n \n \n  One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting\u2014or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n  \n \n  The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n  \n \n  The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Kaiser\u2019s perception of the native groups of seal-people represents how his body is affected by the symbiote that has invaded his system. The first time the man sees them, he considers them mindless repulsive creatures with an unbearable odor and no proper communication system. The second meeting changes his opinion about them - now they seem more advanced in their demeanor and actions, friendlier, and their smell is less repugnant. This change in perception shows that Kaiser has already started changing, becoming more like them. The last meeting with the seal-people makes the man believe that they have more individualistic characteristics. They don\u2019t have the bad odor anymore, just a pleasant scent. They use distinct syllabism, and, finally, living with them and swimming in the river seems more appealing to him than going back to the Soscites II. These seal-people have the same symbiote, which has altered their appearance and mind. At the end, Kaiser practically becomes one of them. ",
        "Summary_2": "The seal-people are the only other signs of life that Kaiser interacts with in the story. Although they are not very intelligent, they are friendly and somewhat harmless. Since Kaiser is trapped anyways, he usually finds time to go visit the seal-people and see any developments in the village. The seal-people are also important because they are infected with the symbiote that Kaiser becomes affected by, changing their appearances to better suit the climate changes that happen on the Big Muddy. As Kaiser spends more time with them, he realizes that they are not as bad as he thinks they are because they can change themselves. As Kaiser eventually chooses to abandon communication with the mother ship and join the seal-people, they have almost become his new family in a sense. ",
        "Summary_3": "The native seal-creatures in the story are important because their very existence unlocks a lot of answers that both Kaiser and those aboard the SS II seek. For one, Big Muddy is said to undergo extreme weather cycle changes between the spring and fall seasons, for which the natives are only able to survive through because of their adaptability. This adaptability is only possible due to the symbiotes that have invaded Kaiser, allowing them such physical change. \n\nThis alludes to what is happening to Kaiser. On his second and third explorations, he supposedly finds seal-people that have become more human-like and intelligence. As we now know by learning about the seal-people, it was less so about the seals being more intelligence but Kaiser becoming more seal-like through this symbiote enacting the physical change. \n",
        "Summary_4": "The seal-people are the native settlers of the planet in which Kaiser crashes. They are described to be half-seal and half-human. They have short hands with 3 fingers, and fin-like feet that allow them to walk on land. They are also very furry, with their color varying. At the beginning of the story, they are described as being unintelligent but friendly. After Kaiser visits a new village, they begin to be more intelligent and Kaiser can communicate with them better. At the end, Kaiser enjoys spending time with them and is showing signs of becoming one of them. \n"

He took a deep shuddering breath.\n  \n \n  \"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's here in Pikeville?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen\nto me.

Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville.

He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing.

        "Summary_1": "The communicator allows Kaiser to receive messages from the mothership and its team. It\u2019s the only mechanism that connects him to other intelligent human beings. Throughout the story, these messages help him understand why he had a fever, swelling, a brief period of blankness, and why he used baby-talk. Using the communication device, the mothership\u2019s team and scientists explain to Kaiser what kind of symbiote lives in his body and how it can gauge his emotional reactions and adapt to various environmental and mental triggers. They manage to ask Keiser to test their theory and later inform him of their findings regarding the planet's climate. They use the tape to order Kaiser to return as soon as possible and finally tell him that the symbiote is probably changing his mind and turning him into someone equal in intelligence to the seal-people. ",
        "Summary_2": "The communication device is what lets Kaiser continue communicating with the mother ship. Without it, he would not have been able to form any form of communication and try to find a solution to his problem. Although the mothership is not helpful in terms of helping him repair the scout ship, he does report to them his symptoms of illness. He gets all of his instructions from them, and they are the ones to diagnose him of having a symbiote in his body. The communication device ties Kaiser to his mission, and he would not be able to receive instructions for the next step if he did not have the communication device. At the end of the story, however, Kaiser sees the communication device as a hindrance because he has no close friends in the crew anyways. He destroys, finally setting himself free from the mothership. ",
        "Summary_3": "The communication device is the only linkage Kaiser has to his crewmates aboard the SS II, and it is the only way Kaiser is able to get verified information (i.e. about his sickness, then later, the seal-creatures). It emphasizes the distance between Kaiser and everybody else. \n\nIt builds tension in the story as communications only come after a period of delivery time. In addition, the messages that come through are often unfinished in the sense that not the full truth of information is provided. ",
        "Summary_4": "The communication device is the only form of communication that Kaiser has with his crew in the large ship. Kaiser was feeling very sick at the beginning of the story, even forgetting parts of what he did. This communication system allowed him to communicate with the ship\u2019s doctor and understand what was going on with him. The communication also allowed Kaiser to understand the implications of his new symbiote. In the end, the communications that the crew sent Kaiser showed the negative effects of the symbiote, and how it would slowly turn Kaiser into a seal-person. "

She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The fact that Kaiser at some point uses baby-talk helps Sam and other members of the Soscites II team determine what exactly caused Kaiser\u2019s symptoms and how it can analyze his emotions and use them to give his body what it needs. The main reason why the man uses baby-talk seems to be that he was most happy in his childhood which also underscores his alienation from people, that he is a loner. Kaiser went to space to run away from his wife and her brother, his colleagues respect him but do not like him, and none of them is Kaiser\u2019s friend. He\u2019s naturally unsociable and was happier when he was a kid. ",
        "Summary_2": "The baby talk that Kaiser experiences is important because it is the effect of the symbiote being in his body. Without the baby talk, the ship would not have accurately determined that there is a symbiote in his body. It also sets off the story, because Kaiser would otherwise believe that he is perfectly fine on the planet. Although he is confused by the baby talk, he does realize that it disappears later. It is an effect of the symbiote, trying to bring him back to a happier time in his life which was childhood. Without the baby talk, it would have been impossible for Kaiser and the rest of the ship to realize the symbiote. It also later directly affects how Kaiser makes the choices regarding the seal-people and how he eventually destroys the communication device to join them. ",
        "Summary_3": "The baby talk is important because it is a clear sign of the symbiote having entered Kaiser's system and adapting him. His other symptoms like changing color or having trouble keeping food down could have been reasoned to a flu or virus, so the baby talk symptom was an important distinction for the doctor and those aboard SS II to identify what was going on. \n\nAdditionally, the reason behind the baby talk appearing hinted at why Kaiser may have more easily given into staying on Big Muddy and transforming into the seal-life creatures. Sam had said the symbiote instilled baby talk back into Kaiser because it believed that Ksier was most happy when he was a child - and wanted to provide Kaiser with this happy state of mind. This, along with Kaiser's feeling lonely and tormented aboard the SS and on Earth respectively, makes sense why Kaiser might choose another way of life for himself and his happiness. ",
        "Summary_4": "The baby talk is one of the symptoms that Kaiser shows at the beginning of the story. While communicating with the ship, he sent the ship weird messages. These messages replicated how babies talk. The ship\u2019s doctor told Kaiser that it was a symptom of the symbiote entering Kaiser\u2019s body, and that the baby talk could be explained. The symbiote wanted Kaiser to feel happy, and it believed that Kaiser had been most happy when he was a baby, so the symbiote tried to replicate those feelings. Overall, the baby talk was the initial sign of the control that the symbiote would have over Kaiser and his body, eventually leading to Kaiser slowly turning into a seal-person."

One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously\nat Lin's bare forearm. \"Look,\" he whispered. \"You know him. I have\u2014a\nlittle money. If you were able to ... if he wants,\" Ri gulped, \"to\n   \n   do\n   \n  anything to me\u2014I'd pay you, if you could....\"\n  \n \n  \"You better come along,\" Lin said, turning.\n  \n \n  Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound,\nineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where\nExtrone was seated, petting his rifle.\n  \n \n  Extrone nodded genially. \"The farn beast hunter, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. \"Tell me\nwhat they look like,\" he said suddenly.\n  \n \n  \"Well, sir, they're ... uh....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty frightening?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   you\n   \n  weren't afraid of them, were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir. No, because....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone was smiling innocently. \"Good.

I....\" Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye.\nLin's face was impassive.\n  \n \n  \"Of\n   \n   course\n   \n  you will,\" Extrone said genially. \"Get me a rope, Lin.

Listen to me.\" Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands\nwere trembling. \"It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir.\n   \n   He\n   \n  killed a farn beast before\n   \n   I\n   \n  did, sir. And last night\u2014last\nnight, he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"He what?\" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.\n  \n \n  Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. \"He said he ought to kill you, sir.\nThat's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you.\nHe's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident,\nsir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I\nwouldn't....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone said, \"Which one is he?\"\n  \n \n  \"That one. Right over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"The one with his back to me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle\nand said, \"Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.\"\n  \n \n  Ri was greenish. \"You ... you....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone turned to Lin. \"Tie one end around his waist.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. \"You don't\nwant to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anything\nshould happen to me.... Please, sir. Don't do it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tie it,\" Extrone ordered.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir. Please. Oh,\n   \n   please\n   \n  don't, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tie it,\" Extrone said inexorably.\n  \n \n  Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.\n  \n<doc-sep>The farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and\nthere was a noise of crackling underbrush.\n  \n \n  \"He's good bait,\" Extrone said. \"He's fat enough and he knows how to\nscream good.\"\n  \n \n  Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully\neying the forest across from the watering hole.\n  \n \n  Extrone began to tremble with excitement. \"Here they come!\"\n  \n \n  The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his\nlap.\n  \n \n  The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank,\nswinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed.\nIts mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs\nbehind them, rattling leaves.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Shoot!\" Lin hissed. \"For God's sake, shoot!\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Extrone said. \"Let's see what they do.\" He had not moved\nthe rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath\nbeginning to sound like an asthmatic pump.\n  \n \n  The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Extrone cried excitedly. \"Here it comes!\"\n  \n \n  Ri began to scream again.\n  \n \n  Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin\nwaited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination.\n  \n \n  The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing\na sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri.\n  \n \n  \"Watch! Watch!\" Extrone cried gleefully.\n  \n \n  And then the aliens sprang their trap.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Four hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked\nleisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at\nthe vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their\nsharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank\ndeeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made\noppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air.\n  \n \n  Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen\nfought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks\nfor farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the\ntree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near.\n  \n \n  Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a\npowerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained\nfire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a\nfolding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered\ntwo-way communication set.\n  \n \n  Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny,\narboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to\nExtrone's satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur.\n  \n \n  When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers\nslump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume,\nhe sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted,\nreflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.\n  \n \n  \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.\n  \n \n  \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be\nimportant.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The\nbearer twiddled the dials.\n  \n \n  \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother\nme?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right\nin the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!\" Extrone\ntore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back,\nfind out what they want, first. I don't want to be bothered unless it's\nimportant.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and\nperspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands.\n  \n \n  Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining\nbearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes.\n\"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About\na quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone's eyes lit with passion.\n  \n \n  Lin's face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward\nand look at the spoor.\"\n  \n \n  Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood\nup.\n  \n \n  \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  \"One is enough in\n   \n   my\n   \n  camp.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "A racketeer, Tony Carmen, comes to Professor Venetti, demanding him figure out how to get rid of the corpse in his house without leaving any traces by using the information Professor Venetti has in his job for the U.S. government that is related to the disposal problem of nuclear waste. Tony threatens Professor Venetti that if Professor Venetti does not abide by what he says, his connection with Mafia will cause Professor Venetti a lot of trouble. Afraid of what the Mafia may do, Professor Venetti finally accepts his request. However, professor Venetti does not abide by the safety and careful principles when he invents the machine, which is named Expendable late after by Tony. He does not know how the machine works either; he creates a device that can turn physical mass into nothingness without knowing where the disposed of mass or energy goes. When he gives the machine to Tony, Tony asks how the machine works, but Professor Venetti cannot explain. Later on, Tony sets up the device on the street, ordering Professor Venetti to turn on the machine, which is modified by a boy who used to be a mechanic, and Professor Venetti does. The machine destroys a warehouse, including the people inside. Professor Venetti condemns Tony for committing a crime, but Tony does not care as there is no corpse to prove the crime. \n\nTony persuades Professor Venetti to put the Expendables into business. He leaks the information about the machine through newspapers to attract big corporations to come for them. As they make more profits from the product and go through all the business matters, an agent from Atomic Energy Commission comes. The agent informs them about the ban of their products because there is a research finding that the side effect of their product is the heat transformed from the mass, which results in the rising temperature. Professor Venetti believes that people would not stop using the products even if they knew what environmental damage they would cause. He creates a reverse version of the machine, called Disexpendable, which would consume the excess energy produced by the Expendables. After he completes it, he turns it on. As the Disexpendable operates, the temperature gets colder, and the corpse, once decomposed, appears in the room in front of the agent. At the same time, Tony orders Professor Venetti to turn off the machine.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Tony Carmen, a criminal with connections in the Mafia, comes to professor Venetti with a request to create some method of getting rid of human corpses with no traces. He says that these are bodies of accident victims left by Harry Keno. Professor tries to come up with different conventional methods. Carmen mentions that he knows Venetti\u2019s affiliation with the radioactive waste disposal program coordinated by the government and wants something more scientifically-based. Venetti thinks about all the attempts the government made to dispose of radioactive waste, but they were all futile since there was no way of creating an effective mechanism without breaking the law of energy conservation. He experiments and manages to create a machine that erases any physical object without any thermal or gravitational traces. When Tony Carmen asks where the matter goes, the professor honestly admits that he doesn\u2019t know. Carmen is suspicious, but Venetti firmly states that even if the objects go to the future or the past, there is a small chance of them appearing again soon. Tony starts talking about the mass-production of these machines, but Venetti initially protests, scared of legal prosecution and reputational damage. But eventually, the professor gives up, realizing that this mechanism  - Tony calls it an Expendable - won\u2019t be useful to the government. Sometime later, Camren and Venetti decide to test the machine outside. After flipping the switch, Venetti sees that a distant warehouse building disappears. He is shocked and soon notices that the unit is halved. Tony says that his friend separated the mechanism to square the operational field, and it worked. He also says that his enemy Harry Keno just got wiped out together with his intimates and their confidential squat. The following morning, the Times mentions the vanishing of the building and that the government is developing a disintegrating process for waste. Tony comes to him and tells him that Arcivox - a company producing radios and TV sets - wants to buy the machine. Tony suggests selling the potent and keeping it in control through a separate corporation. Several months later, professor Venetti is in his office talking to his secretary, Miss Brown, about the future business communications. Suddenly Tony bangs open the door and says that G-men are on their way. Seconds later, an investigator from the Atomic Energy Commission comes in. He quickly states that the manufacturing of the Expendable will soon be banned. He explains that their scientists understood that the energy the machine seemingly destroyed actually turned into heat. This process increased the mean temperature. The professor agrees but adds that people are too stubborn to stop using the machine. He suggests creating an engine that would use up this extra energy. When they switch the disexpendable on, slowly the body of Harry Keno appears on the revolving disc. At the end, Venetti claims that his inventions are useless now and that this story is true, and he encourages the readers to write letters towards his upcoming defense.",
        "Summary_3": "The story follows a scientist who works for the U.S. Government. He is trying to find ways that the Government can get rid of radioactive and nuclear waste cleanly and safely. He is approached by a member of the Italian Mob. He asks Venetti to continue making this instrument, and to give him a copy when he makes it, because he needs to find a way to get rid of human bodies. At the beginning Venetti doubts doing this, but he believes it is a good way to make money. Venetti finally makes it and it, and gives Venetti one of the machines. The machine seems to get rid of anything that is put in it, without leaving behind any trace. Together, they start a company and commercially sell the boxes as expendables. They start to gain a lot of money, because it makes life easier for a lot of people. Their company grows a lot, and they start to get a lot of. Finally, it is revealed that the expendables have been contributing to global warming, as it excretes the energy into the environment. Venetti develops another machine in order to counteract the effects of the original expendable, which leads to regenerating everything that was put in the machine, including the dead bodies. This leads to Venetti being sued for the expendables, as people believe that he approached the member of the mob first. ",
        "Summary_4": "The Expendables is written in the form of a personal account by scientist Professor Venetti. He is approached by a stranger claiming to know the Mafia, Tony Carmen, who asks him for a favor to which Venetti initially refuses. Carmen is trying to use the professor\u2019s potential invention to get rid of dead bodies Carmen has. After Carmen makes Venetti aware that he knows about his secret project with the government to develop an innovation that would get rid of radioactive wastes, Carmen manages to make Venetti agree to help him. Prof. Venetti makes him promise that he did not kill the bodies. Venetti has yet to succeed in finding such an invention because this requires a neutralization of the radioactive emanations while he has only been able to reduce the radioactive mass. With less responsibility and credibility associated with Tony\u2019s request compared to the government\u2019s, he decides to perform more risky experimentations. He finds a way to make trash disappear but by completely destroying its mass. Venetti thinks that contrary to the government, Carmen would not be curious enough to ask where the mass actually goes. Carmen does in fact ask this when Venetti shows him the machine as he is concerned that he will get caught. Venetti genuinely does not know the answer and Carmen proposes that they launch the machine as the \u201cExpendable\u201d. With his business expertise, Carmen promises to help with the launch while Venetti is still concerned with the ethical implications such as a possible rise in murder rate. Together, they go test the machine on an empty, wide land with bodyguards around in case any policemen show up. When they use it, a square shape of the horizon disappears and Tony uses the machine for corpses which Venetti ultimately understands were results of Carmen\u2019s own crime. The next morning, the innovation is featured in the newspaper as a rumor. Arcivox, a radio and TV company, expresses interest. Tony convinces Venetti to accept the offer when they come forward, saying that he will give him a large portion of the stocks.\n\nFlash forward into time, after taking the offer, Venetti is now a business man but he is not enjoying it. One day, the Atomic Energy Commission approaches his team, telling him they need to end the Expendables. They explain that their scientists used to think that the increasing hot weather was due to nuclear testing but they found that it was in fact due to the Expendables. The machines merely destroy matter but do not create any, violating the law of conversion of energy which could raise the Earth temperature to worrying extremities. Venetti argues that the public would not be willing to stop its use because of how convenient it is and instead agrees to create \u201cDisexpendibles\u201d which would create the opposite effect. When put to use, the temperature readjusts but trash reappears and so do the bodies that Tony wanted gone. At the very least, this held Tony accountable for his actions.\n"

But ... that is, you didn't\nkill any of these people?\"\n  \n \n  He snorted. \"I haven't killed anybody since early 1943.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" I said weakly. \"You needn't incriminate yourself with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was in the Marines,\" Carmen said hotly. \"Listen, Professor, these\naren't no Prohibition times. Not many people get made for a hit these\ndays. Mother, most of these bodies they keep ditching at my club\nhaven't been murdered by anybody. They're accident victims.

An\ninteresting problem, at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I figured you could handle it,\" Carmen said, leaning back comfortably\nin the favorite chair of my bachelor apartment. \"I heard you were\nworking on something to get rid of trash for the government.\"\n  \n \n  \"That,\" I told him, \"is restricted information. I subcontracted that\nwork from the big telephone laboratories. How did you find it out?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ways, Professor, ways.\"\n  \n \n  The government did want me to find a way to dispose of\nwastes\u2014radioactive wastes. It was the most important problem any\ncountry could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a\nsmall-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him\ndispose of hot corpses. It made my scientific blood seethe. But the\nshadow of the Black Hand cooled it off.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I can find something in that area of research to help you,\" I\nsaid. \"I'll call you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't take too long, Professor,\" Carmen said cordially.\n  \n<doc-sep>Once seated, the AEC man said \"I'll get right to the point.

May we ask why\nyou took this step?\"\n  \n \n  The agent inserted a finger between his collar and tie. \"Have you\nnoticed how unseasonably warm it is?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wondered if you had.

There is a ban on frivolous use\nof water due to the dire need. But the police still have to go stop\npeople from watering lawns, and I suspect not a few swimming pools are\nbeing filled on the sly.

So will be\ngenerating enough heat to turn Eden into Hell.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mass psychology isn't my strongest point,\" the young man said\nworriedly. \"But I suspect you may be right. Then\u2014we'll be damned?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, not necessarily,\" I told him comfortingly. \"All we have to do is\n   \n   use up\n   \n  the excess energy with engines of a specific design.\"\n  \n \n  \"But can we design those engines in time?\" the young man wondered with\nuncharacteristic gloom.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" I said, practising the power of positive thinking. \"Now\nthat your world-wide testing laboratories have confirmed a vague fear\nof mine, I can easily reverse the field of the Expendable device and\ncreate a rather low-efficiency engine that consumes the excess energy\nin our planetary potential.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"There's something to what you say,\" I admitted in the face of his\nunexpected information. \"But I can hardly turn my invention over to\nyour entirely persuasive salesmen, I'm sure.

        "Summary_1": "Tony Carmen is a racketeer who threatens Professor Venetti to invent the machine to decompose corpses without leaving any traces. He is also a criminal who does not care about killing people, so he orders Professor Venetti to conduct the machine to wipe off the warehouse and the people inside. It is also implied that he kills the corpse he wants to get rid of. When he receives the machine Professor Venetti creates, he gives it to his subordinates and lets them modify it. He takes Professor Venetti to the place where they try the machine's function. He has many connections to business, the mafia, and the news, and he knows how to make profits by manipulating the business work behind the scene. When he realizes how much profit the machine can make after seeing its effects, he persuades Professor Venetti to collaborate with him. He leaks the information through the newspaper to attract the business corporates\u2019 attention. When the agent from Atomic Energy Commission informs the harmful consequences of the machine, he strongly disagrees with the ban on the manufacture and the selling of the device. When Professor Venetti turns on the reverse machine, Tony is panicked, and he shouts to order the professor to turn off the engine.",
        "Summary_2": "Tony Carmen is one of the near-mafia criminals. At the beginning, he asks a scientist called Venetti, who works in the secret radioactive wastes disposal project, to come up with a mechanism that could help Tony get rid of the bodies Harry Keno leaves at his place. Soon the professor says that he created a mechanism that works like an incinerator but with no traces. Tony tries to understand where the bodies would go after disappearing in this machine. Venetti honestly says that he doesn\u2019t know where they end up: it might be the past, the future, or another dimension. He also explains that the probability of finding these bodies is small, and Tony accepts this. Carmen also mentions that they could mass-produce these machines, which Venetti finds impractical. Tony calls it an Expendable and decides to test it. He asks his friend to halve the unit to cover the area of Harry Keno\u2019s warehouse. When the professor turns it on, the building disappears, wiping out its inhabitants - Keno and his intimates - too. Tony starts leaking information about the mechanism to intrigue potential buyers, for example, ordering a small article in the Times. Soon he gets an offer from Arcivox - a manufacturer of radio and TV sets. Tony persuades the professor to sell the potent and control the manufacturing through a separate company. Their business grows fast. Months later, Tony learns that some government officials are going to come to them. He gets into Venetti\u2019s office seconds before the AEC man shows up at the door. Tony starts threatening the officer but gets a witty comeback and then keeps silent. They hear that the government scientist learned that the energy the expendables seemingly destroyed has been turning into heat energy, increasing the mean temperature of Earth and leading to a climate catastrophe. Venetti proposes creating an engine that could use the excess energy by reversing the expendable mechanism. When they switch the engine on, Tony screams to the professor to turn the mechanism off, but the body of Harry Keno appears quickly. They both are under investigation. ",
        "Summary_3": "Tony Carmen is a member of the Italian mob who approaches Venetti. Tony is in desperate need of a machine to get rid of bodies. He believes that Venetti could create this device. When Venetti does create it, Tony convinces him to partner with him and start selling them commercially. Tony believes that there is a big space in the market for people to buy them. After he uses the machine to get rid of some men who were messing with his business. At the end, both Tony and Venetti are put on trial. ",
        "Summary_4": "Tony Carmen is a stranger who approaches Professor Venetti, claiming that he knows the Mafia. He threatens Venetti into helping him with his potential new invention. Carmen is in need of assistance to get rid of dead bodies he has. Venetti is currently working on a secret project with the government to create an innovation that would get rid of radioactive waste. Tony manages to make Venetti agree to help him by threatening him. When Venetti comes up with a machine, \u201cthe Expendable,\u201d which he took unusual risks to create, they go test it together on a wide, empty lawn. Tony\u2019s demeanor changes as he becomes more aggressive and makes the bodies, which is hinted that he actually murdered, disappear through the machine. He lures the professor to launch the machine on the market and helps him when a large corporation approaches them. As their business booms, they are approached by the Atomic Energy Commission which explains that their machines have been raising Earth\u2019s temperature and need to be stopped. The professor explains that customer behavior will be hard to change and instead creates \u201cDisexpendables\u201d which does the opposite effect. Tony is very much against this and when put to use, the bodies he hid all come back. This allows the professor to restore justice by disproving the narrative that Tony was creating in which lawyers claimed that the professor approached Tony, suggesting to help him get rid of his enemies in exchange for financial backing for his innovation.\n"

The problem that Venetti is faced with is that getting an energy to destroy another energy without creating new energy actually violates the law of conservation of energy.

Venetti has yet to succeed in finding such an invention because this requires a neutralization of the radioactive emanations while he has only been able to reduce the radioactive mass. Ultimately, motivated by Venetti\u2019s agreement, he finds a way to make trash disappear but by completely destroying its mass. Together with Carmen, they call this machine the \u201cExpendable.\u201d The only issue is that Venetti does not actually know where the disappeared mass goes. Later, this invention causes issues as by violating the law of conservation of energy, it raises the Earth\u2019s temperature. To fix this, Venetti comes up with another invention, the \u201cDisexpendable,\u201d which would do the opposite effect, consuming the excess energy.

        "Summary_1": "Throughout the story, a racketeer demands a professor create a machine to destroy the dead body he has without leaving any traces. The professor invented the device that can destroy mass into nothingness without knowing where the decomposed particles or mass go. However, later in the story, it reveals that the missing energy is turned into heat under the rule of energy conservation, resulting in a rising global temperature. The officials come to ban the usage and production of the machine, but the professor knows that people will still use it for its convenience, just like what people do concerning the wasteful use of water when it is in dire need. The professor ends up creating a machine whose side effect would cool down the temperature to fix the problem. The theme of global warming is explored through the conflicted balance between convenience and environmental damage. People tend to use what is convenient for them with the knowledge of its ecological harm until the consequence is no longer recoverable. The author tries to imply that if we keep wasting resources and damage the environment for our benefit, global warming will reach a point where the earth is no longer recoverable. It is also mentioned in the professor\u2019s thought when he is thinking about selling the machine that tons of patented perpetual motion machines are created, used, and remain as trash without the means to get rid of them. People don\u2019t care whether there is a solution to get rid of those trash completely or don\u2019t know how, but they still produce and use them. This preference for convenience over the environment indicates that humans would not stop their pollution until they bear the consequence of their deeds, not to mention improve the situation of global warming.",
        "Summary_2": "Professor Venetti was struggling when creating the mechanism because the physical law of energy conservation didn\u2019t allow him to destroy energy without its simultaneous recreation. Eventually, we learn that the Expandable was actually recreating the energy of the disintegrated matter in the form of heat. His invention led to global warming - the increase in the mean temperature on Earth. The professor realizes the danger of his invention but also admits that it\u2019s unlikely people would quickly stop using such a convenient mechanism. They would ignore the consequences. ",
        "Summary_3": "Global warming is an important theme throughout the story. At first, Venetti wanted to create a machine that could reduce the environmental impact of radioactive and nuclear waste. This type of waste harmed the environment, as before the expendables the waste was put underground, where it would seep into the ocean and water supplies. After the use of expendables increased, it seemed like there was little environmental impact, but then it was revealed that the expendables actually increased global warming. This led to Veretti creating a new device that could reverse the effects, leading to all the dead bodies coming back and Veretti getting put on trial. ",
        "Summary_4": "One of the main themes explored in \u201cThe Expenables\u201d is the concept of global warming. Even though published in 1962, the story gives a commentary on the roots of global warming and human responses to it. Initially, we are introduced to the issue of waste with the government and a scientist trying to figure out a way out of it. The ideal thought that we could create an invention that could simply \u201cremove\u201d trash reminds the readers of how we as humans take the consequences of our actions for granted and think that anything can be fixed, even global littering. This shows that we tend to tackle such global problems at the end of their timeline rather than try to genuinely prevent them from happening in the first place. By the end of the story, however, even when a machine has been successfully created to fix this issue, another one, an increase in Earth temperature still occurs. In other words, as the law of conversion of energy states in the story that an energy cannot be destroyed without producing another energy is similar to saying that every action has to have a consequence. The readers recognize that they cannot get the best of both worlds all the time. Venetti also mentions to the Atomic Energy Commission when they want to end the Expendables that the public would not agree to do so because of how convenient it is just like failure to stop them from watering lawns. This symbolizes how global warming or any global issue usually arises from humans\u2019 carelessness and laziness, assuming that their actions are of little importance on this big Earth.\n"

To me, being dead professionally would be as bad as\nbeing dead biologically.\"\n  \n \n  Tony Carmen laid a heavy hand on my shoulder.

I can't become involved in\nanything illegal.\"\n  \n \n  Carmen smoothed down the front of his too-tight midnight blue suit and\ntouched the diamond sticking in his silver tie. \"You can't, Professor\nVenetti? Ever hear of the Mafia?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've heard of it,\" I said uneasily. \"An old fraternal organization\nsomething like the Moose or Rosicrucians, founded in Sicily. It\nallegedly controls organized crime in the U.S. But that is a\nresponsibility-eluding myth that honest Italian-Americans are stamping\nout. We don't even like to see the word in print.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can understand\n   \n   honest\n   \n  Italian-Americans feeling that way. But guys\nlike me know the Mafia is still with it.

I had heard too much and for too\nlong. All the stories I had ever heard about the Mafia, true or false,\nbuilt up an unendurable threat.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll try to help you, Carmen. But ... that is, you didn't\nkill any of these people?\"\n  \n \n  He snorted. \"I haven't killed anybody since early 1943.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" I said weakly. \"You needn't incriminate yourself with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was in the Marines,\" Carmen said hotly. \"Listen, Professor, these\naren't no Prohibition times. Not many people get made for a hit these\ndays. Mother, most of these bodies they keep ditching at my club\nhaven't been murdered by anybody. They're accident victims. Rumbums\nwith too much anti-freeze for a summer's day, Spanish-American War vets\ngoing to visit Teddy in the natural course of events. Harry Keno just\nstows them at my place to embarrass me. Figures to make me lose my\nliquor license or take a contempt before the Grand Jury.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose you could just go to the police\u2014\" I saw the answer in\nhis eyes. \"No. I don't suppose you could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you once, Professor, but I'll tell you again.

And I suppose the furnace leaves ashes and there's\nalways traces of hair and teeth in the garbage disposal... An\ninteresting problem, at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I figured you could handle it,\" Carmen said, leaning back comfortably\nin the favorite chair of my bachelor apartment. \"I heard you were\nworking on something to get rid of trash for the government.\"\n  \n \n  \"That,\" I told him, \"is restricted information. I subcontracted that\nwork from the big telephone laboratories. How did you find it out?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ways, Professor, ways.\"\n  \n \n  The government did want me to find a way to dispose of\nwastes\u2014radioactive wastes. It was the most important problem any\ncountry could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a\nsmall-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him\ndispose of hot corpses. It made my scientific blood seethe. But the\nshadow of the Black Hand cooled it off.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I can find something in that area of research to help you,\" I\nsaid. \"I'll call you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't take too long, Professor,\" Carmen said cordially.\n  \n<doc-sep>The agent of the AEC whose name I can never remember was present along\nwith Tony Carmen the night my assistants finished with the work I had\noutlined.\n  \n \n  While it was midnight outside, the fluorescents made the scene more\nvisible than sunlight.

So the world is again stuck\nwith the problem of waste disposal ... including all that I dumped\nbefore.

        "Summary_1": "The theme of capitalism is explored throughout the story by the greed of the racketeer, Tony Carmen, and how he prefers profits over the environment. In the story, Professor Venetti creates a machine that can easily decompose anything without knowing how it works and where the decomposed particles go. His process of creating the device is also not carefully examined under the safety rules. Despite knowing these manufacturing facts and the uncertainty of its consequences, Tony Carmen makes this machine into a business and sells it for a considerable profit, with the collaboration of Professor Venetti. The theme of capitalism is shown through the preference for profits over safety when seeking profits from a product. It is also explored through Tony\u2019s dealings with business corporates and how he attracts business corporations\u2019 attention to sell their products. Revealed by Tony\u2019s testimony, big business corporations would have detectives and their sources of information to buy the inventions and sell them. Finally, the mechanism of the business world and the dark side of capitalism are shown through Tony\u2019s plan to sell the products and all the dirty work behind it when Professor Venetti\u2019s secretary is reading the letters regarding their business matter from several organizations.",
        "Summary_2": "The story shows how commercial benefits may outweigh all the negative consequences of inventions and products. Tony Carmen says that the government would allow a private company like Arcivox to sell anything - they just have to find a commercial use for a potential product. Tony Carmen\u2019s and Venetti\u2019s desire to profit off of the professor\u2019s mechanism leads to global warming and makes the threat of climate doomsday more than realistic. The story also shows that people disregard environmental repercussions when the commodity they\u2019re using is convenient.\n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Capitalism is one of the most important themes in the story. Veretti\u2019s and Tony\u2019s hunger for money is what led them to selling these very controversial boxes, and Veretti deciding to look away when the boxes were used for murder. When convincing Veretti to work with him, Tony even compares him to Henry Ford and Sam Colt, two famous capitalists that also decided to look away when their inventions lead to death. Capitalism also was the reason that led to an absurd number of sales of the expendables, as consumers are always looking for their lives to be easier. The expendables provided this exact same service, as it was a very easy and simple way that people could get rid of trash.",
        "Summary_4": "One of the main themes explored in \u201cThe Expenables\u201d is also the concept of capitalism. We are first introduced to a scientist working for the government with the best intentions to find a fix to a global issue through innovation. As the story goes on, however, he is lured by a stranger belonging to the mafia to take the easy and riskier path to speed up the process of creating a successful innovation. Additionally, when this machine works, we see the professor ditch his ethical concerns around it and rather starts getting attracted by the financial benefits he is told he could get by the stranger if he were to launch his product on the market. Instead of sticking with his initial intentions of helping the government, he chooses to partner with a large corporation who takes on his machines worldwide as he is promised a big sum of the stocks. This showcases human greed that arises from capitalism and how it can consume an individual to the point that they disregard all ethical thoughts, even when on a global level. Moreover, we are introduced to the idea of convenience the public is used to. Instead of ending his machines, the scientist creates another machine to counter the effect of his first one as he believes the public will not be able to part its convenience. This showcases the speed as to which capitalism has led our lives to adapt to and how because of that, people would choose convenience over the greater good at any time.\n"

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters.

When he turns 17, he cuts away from his family and starts to follow his dream. He participates in different plane races in order to become a pilot. He continuously shows his determination to become a pilot to everyone he meets, and doesn\u2019t care what they say. Mostly everyone tells Ish that he should quit on this path, that he has nothing to prove and that there is no reason to continue pursuing his dream. He doesn\u2019t heed this advice and continues convincing people as to why he should be a rocket pilot. At the end, he manages to do the trip, but does it while thinking that he had already done it before, therefore taking out all the excitement that the first trip would have had. He ends up never driving a rocket again, and dies in the rocket station. ",

His father begins to laugh, and Martin decides to run away. His mother comes in and asks what is wrong, and his father tells her about what their son has claimed as his trade. Margaret is confused, and Howard tries to chase him as Ish hops on a bus and goes away. When the man tells his faculty advisor that he is not interested in a degree, the advisor is exasperated because he has been doing math and engineering for the past nine semesters. Ish says that he is signed up for Astronomy 101, and he tries to argue why this course is different. Ish offers for them to get a beer together instead, since it will be impossible to convince him. He does not understand the advisor\u2019s poetry, and the advisor comments that he is a specialist. The scene then cuts to The Navion taking a boiling thermal under its right wing, buckling suddenly and tilting. Ish tells Nan to relax, but she is afraid of how low he is flying. As Ish does a few more tricks, he suddenly feels fear because the aircraft begins to act strangely. Nan is curious why he is so desperate to win the Vandenberg Cup next week. He reveals that this is all part of his plan of being a rocket pilot, and Nan does not understand. The scene then cuts to four years later, as Ish brings the Mark VII out of her orbit and gives the technicians a report. Nan tells him that he has accomplished his dream, but Ish suddenly feels tired and outraged that the pile of tin can be considered a rocket. The Flight Surgeon then talks to him in another scene, asking if he would like to talk to a man named MacKenzie. Ish agrees, and MacKenzie asks him questions about his personal life. The therapist offers shock therapy, but Martin insists that it did not work. The receptionist at the front desk tries to get him to fill out paperwork too, but he vehemently refuses and complains that he has no time. The scene then cuts to the Personnel Manager meeting him, and they discuss the plans moving forward. The Personnel Manager discusses the rocket some more with him, before the scene cuts to a crew chief waking him up to go to the station. After his trip, MacKenzie is waiting for him at the crew station. MacKenzie tells him that he was hypnotized because his lack of interests and emotions prevented him from being the best. Ish refuses to believe it, and MacKenzie says that he had to cancel the thrill of it by making him experience the Moon and death. Ish dies in space after MacKenzie leaves, having lost his passion while staring at the stars. ",

Later, Martin is older and talking to his faculty advisor about the classes he plans on taking. We learn that the young man has taken almost every math and engineering class and has signed up for astronomy. His advisor doesn\u2019t understand why Martin is avoiding liberal arts classes. They go to a bar where the adviser again wonders what specialty made Martin abandon all the other existing disciplines. Martin assures him there\u2019s a purpose behind it. \nNow Martin is a certified pilot. He\u2019s on the board of the Navion plane with a girl named Nan. He makes the plane dive and tilt, which scares her. At some point, he becomes delusional and brings the plane higher and higher before he finally hears the girl\u2019s screams. Martin tells her he cannot marry her because he is not rich, and it will take years before he becomes a real rocket pilot. Nan doesn\u2019t understand his passion. Years later, Martin manages to spin around the Earth on the ship Mark VII for two days. He\u2019s not satisfied. While walking from the ship, he meets Nan, who tells him that she understands his passion now and is happy he\u2019s done. He becomes angry and says that he\u2019s not finished anything. He talks to a psychiatrist named Mackenzie assigned to him by the Air Force. The man asks questions about his first jobs at the airports near Miami. He makes sure Martin has no family. Then he suddenly shocks him by saying that Martin can\u2019t go - this maddens the pilot. Seconds later, the doctor apologizes, claiming that it was shotgun therapy to check his reactions. Next, Martin argues with some receptionist, trying to convince her to help him get back - apparently, he died. He says he has a job. He forces her to call the Personnel Manager. Martin tells the man that he only has six hours before the flight to the Moon and asks for a postponement so that he could finish the journey. The manager then shows Martin the Earth, and the man realizes he\u2019s standing in one of the lunar craters. Martin finally wakes up just an hour before the launch. He completes the flight but is dissatisfied. Mackenzie meets him in the crew section and explains that he had to hypnotize Martin before the flight, make him believe he had died and had been to the Moon. The Air Force was not sure Martin, who had no ties to the planet and no interests, would\u2019ve come back. The hallucination made the pilot believe he had already been to the Moon, thus taking the adventure out of the actual flight.\n",

The brief commanding burst\nwas over, and his face was apologetic, \"Sorry,\" he said. He seemed\ngenuinely abashed. \"Shotgun therapy. Works best, sometimes. You can go,\nall right; I just wanted to get a fast check on your reactions and\ndrives.\"\n  \n \n  Ish could feel the anger that still ran through him\u2014anger, and more\nfear than he wanted to admit. \"I'm due at a briefing,\" he said tautly.\n\"You through with me?\"\n  \n \n  MacKenzie nodded, still embarrassed. \"Sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Ish ignored the man's obvious feelings.

Well, your professional lingo's slipping, Doc.\nThey did put\n   \n   some\n   \n  learning in my head at college, you know. Therapy,\nhell! Testing maybe, but you sure didn't do anything to help me!\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" MacKenzie said softly. \"I wish I did.\"\n  \n \n  Ish slammed the door behind him. He stood in the corridor, jamming a\nfresh cigarette in his mouth. He threw a glance at his watch. Twelve\nhours, twenty-two minutes, and four days to go.\n  \n \n  Damn! He was late for the briefing. Odd\u2014that fool psychiatrist hadn't\nseemed to take up that much of his time.\n  \n \n  He shrugged. What difference did it make? As he strode down the hall, he\nlost his momentary puzzlement under the flood of realization that\nnothing could stop him now, that the last hurdle was beaten. He was\ngoing. He was going, and if there were faint echoes of \"Marty!\" ringing\nin the dark background of his mind, they only served to push him faster,\nas they always had.

Mackenzie apologizes and explains that he just decided to use shotgun therapy to check Martin\u2019s reactions and drives. The doctor feels embarrassed. Then at some point, Mackenzie hypnotizes Martin, making him believe that he has already been to the Moon.

        "Summary_1": "One of the greatest challenges that Martin faces in his journey to become a rocket pilot is the negativity that comes from other people. Almost everyone that Martin meets advises him that he is wasting his life, and that he should focus on something more realistic that can allow him to have a family. His parents, his girlfriend, and Mackenzie all tell him that he should settle for a plane pilot or should focus his career on something else, something less risky. These words only help to make Martin more determined to become a pilot, because he wants to prove everyone wrong. ",
        "Summary_2": "Other people\u2019s words about the rocket is significant because it reveals how far gone Ish already is in comparison to everyone else. When Nan mentions that he has already flown a rocket, Ish yells at her that it is not enough because it is not considered a true rocket. Even when the Flight Surgeon speaks to him, he is mostly impatient about the rocket. When MacKenzie brings up the rocket and his goal later, it shows the significance of what Ish has done to achieve his dream. He has no family, friends, or has formed any sort of meaningful relationship. In addition, he has also never touched another book or literature that was not related to space, math, or engineering. The other people\u2019s words about the rocket only illustrate Ish\u2019s own stunted development out of his obsession with becoming a pilot for it. ",
        "Summary_3": "People\u2019s comments about a man-carrying rocket that didn\u2019t exist when Martin was a young boy only encouraged him to work harder to achieve his dream. When his dad bursts out laughing at his words about becoming a rocket pilot, little Marty walks away while his parents are ordering him to come back. He remembers their screams when he realizes that he can go to space after the conversation with Mackenzie. When Nan tells him that there are no man-carrying rockets, he says that it\u2019s not his problem, implying that they will be invented at some point and he will be the one who travels to the Moon on one of them. When several years later, she tells him happily that he\u2019s flown his rocket - he becomes angry. Martin shows that he\u2019s way more obsessed now and doesn\u2019t really care about the means of transport that will take him to the Moon. What he cares about is the thrill of the unknown. ",
        "Summary_4": "Throughout the story, whenever Martin Isherwood, a trained pilot who has been dreaming of going to the moon, talks about his dream, people either do not believe in him or misunderstand him. When people try to convince Martin to pursue another career or face reality, they always say that there is no man-carrying rocket in the world, to which Martin always responds with an answer that it is not his problem. However, these words suggest that Martin's dream is unfulfillable initially, but he does not believe in it and keeps his pursuit until his death. These words about the nonexistence of the man-carrying rocket imply the consequence of the story that all of Martin's journey is imaginary and hallucinated. His dream ends up being a joke to himself."

        "Summary_1": "The story is set in the fourth millennium, and humans have invented a technology - the Ringwave propulsion-communication principle -  that allows them to explore the neighboring cosmic systems. In the past, they were invaded by an alien species called Hymenops, or the Bees, who enslaved Terrans, and tried to colonize other planets but unexpectedly left years later. The crew members of the spaceship Marco Four are on a mission looking for the slave colonies that were abandoned by the Bees. Farrell, the navigator, is arguing with captain Stryker, Gibson - an engineer - and Xavier, the ship\u2019s mechanic, and is trying to convince them to land on Alphard Six and claiming the planet is not inhabited. Stryker reminds him about the importance of vigilance on unexplored territories and tells Farrell to find a reconnaissance spiral. Something resembling an atomic torpedo explodes near the ship, rocking it. Later, the crew starts discussing who can possibly live on Alphard Six. They know that in the year 3000, there was no one on the planet. The ones who attacked them might be the Hymenopes or some Terrans enslaved by them, or even an unknown alien culture. The screen shows a town with a thousand buildings and a prehistoric ship with rocket propulsion. This ship seems to be eleven hundred years old, which is puzzling. This atomic-powered spaceship neither could\u2019ve been constructed here nor could it have successfully traveled for hundreds of years. The area around Alphard Six was guarded by the Bees for several hundred years. So, it would be impossible for this ancient Terran ship to land on the planet without being detected by them. Farrell interrupts the discussion and suggests they go down and look. He gets on a helihopper, and Xavier quickly disappears in his scouter. The two other crew members left on the ship say that they just detected an electromagnetic vibration. Farrell notices a bonfire near the town. He is ready to report it when his helihopper suddenly jerks, a flare of electric discharge blinds him, and Farrell loses consciousness. He wakes up in an infirmary. A doctor speaks in unintelligible words and gestures to Farrell to follow him. While walking through the corridors of the ancient ship, he notices Xavier\u2019s scouter, and later the Marco Four. Shocked, Farrell rapidly plunges inside the spaceship, and it darts up when suddenly Stryker appears from the sleeping cubicle and orders him to fly back. Gibson explains that Farrell piloted his helihopper into power lines and crashed. The Alphardians tried to communicate with the crew using an electromagnetic wave language and never attacked them. The Bees made the ancestors of these people believe that they were the descendants of an Earth expedition that perished a thousand years ago. The Alphardians don\u2019t even know the Hymenops. Apparently, the Bees wanted to monitor the human species in a natural habitat. But they never understood human logic and after all, left all their colonies. ",

Farrell argues that it was never colonized, while Gibson looks up from his chess game and says there is no point in taking a chance of not encountering any of the Hymenops. Farrell says that they will never see a Hymenop, but Stryker says that he fought them for the better half of the century and still does not understand how they behave. They decide to find a reconnaissance spiral, despite Farrell grumbling. They examine whether anything is damaged on the Marco Four, after an explosion, and find that the only component that requires fixing is the Zero Transfer computer. Gibson explains that they cannot be Hymenops since the Bees put their faith in Ringwave energy fields. Although Stryker proposes colonists migrating from somewhere else, Gibson explains that it is impossible for the human slaves of the Hymenops to develop interstellar travel in four generations. Farrell volunteers to go down for the field work; Xavier announces that the planet is uninhabited except for a large island. There is a central city with a thousand buildings, and Farrell is relieved they are human. The power the people use runs on continuous fission, which surprises everyone. It is quite surprising for the crew to see an eleven-hundred year old Terran ship land on the planet. Stryker explains to Farrell that it had to be flown here because there are no materials on Alphard Six to create it. Gibson believes that the ship was built during the Twenty-second century, even though the atomic wars destroyed all historical records. Farrell decides that the only way is to go down and see for themselves. Xavier picks up an electromagnetic vibration pattern, and Farrell reports that he is passing over a hamlet nearest to the city. Suddenly, he is hit by an electric discharge and wakes up in an infirmary. A man comes and takes him out, despite speaking a different language, and he realizes that one of the old ventures had actually succeeded. He sees that the Marco Four has been grounded too and runs to the ship before pushing some controls to take off again. Stryker brings the ship down again, and Farrell is shocked because he thought they were shot down. It turns out that the Alphardians had been trying to send a distress signal. Gibson further explains that they had come from one of the first Bee colonies and were led to believe that their ship missed Sirius; however, the colonists are excited to enjoy assimilation. Although the Bees tried to set up the experiment to understand humans, the invaders failed at truly understanding them. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story follows a Terran Reclamations crew aboard the Marco Four as they search for Terran colonies previously enslaved and since abandoned by the Bees. As they travel around, a sudden atomic fire hits the ship and the crew hurry to figure out where it had come from and who potentially caused it. Debating between Hymenops, resurgent colonists,  trans-Alphardians, or even a joint hallucination, the crew decide to investigate further. Xavier, the mechanical, surveys the planet and finds the landscape to be Terran, though with primitive technology at best. These findings leave them more confused than before, as they then debate how an eleven hundred years old ship could be there. \n\nDeciding then to investigate first-hand and see, Farrell goes into the helihopper and enters the colony. Just as Gibson encourages to go forward as it seems like the colony is communicating with them, Farrell crashes into an electrical line and falls unconscious. As he wakes up, Farrell is met by an unfamiliar medic and follows him out to a well-formed colony, marvelling at the presumed success of old ventures. However, he panics when he sees the Marco Four grounded and presumes his crewmates are in danger, and so he hurriedly rushes onboard and puts it in flight. Stryker stumbles out and takes them back down as Gibson quickly explains to Farrell the situation. It turns out that there is no danger at hand - the crash that landed Farrell unconscious was just an electrical line for the colony's hamlets. The colony, the Alphardians, are friendly and excited to be found. Although using Terran architecture and technology, these Alphardians were experimental human subjects by the Hymenops and observed by the Bees. The Bees chose to abandon their control colony when the Alphardians didn't show much - much like the old tale of Terrans not understanding alien culture either. In the end, the Alphardians are excited to assimilate into Terran colonists. ",
        "Summary_4": "A Terran Reclamation crew arrives Alphard Six to find Terran colonies enslaved and abandoned by the Bees, or Hymenops, an alien species who retreated a hundred years ago. When the youngest navigator, Farrell, attempts to planetfall without scouting the planet, the captain, Stryker, reminds him of the possible danger of the planet and the necessity of reconnaissance. After arguing with other crew members, Farrell finally accepts to scout the unobserved world first. However, they are suddenly attacked by a thing rising from the land below. After the examination, Gibson, the engineer, announces that the only damage is Zero Interval Transfer Computer, used to operate the Transfer jump in space. The repairing time takes a couple of hours. Stryker worries about the possible attack during the repairing time, so they dispute the potential situation of the planet, and none of the hypotheses, such as the Hymenops\u2019 colorizations, Earthmen\u2019s ancient colonization, or the resurgent Terran colonization, hold based on technological development. Stryker concludes that they have to investigate the land themselves. Farrell volunteers to be the one. They see the ground through magnoscanner, finding a damaged spaceship that served as a power supply with the prehistoric technology, namely atomic fission. According to Gibson, the atomic-powered ship was no longer built after the atomic wars in the twenty-second century; the damaged ship must either be flown or be built on the planet. His hypothesis is rejected by Stryker and Farrell based on the impossibility of the long-range travel capability of the atomic-powered spaceship. They continue their endless debate until Farrell takes the helihopper to investigate. Xavier, the mechanic, uses his drone to scout ahead of Farrell, but soon the scouter is detected by the people on the planet. They try to communicate with them with the electron beam. When Farrell reaches the end of the forest, entering the fields, he is suddenly struck and passes out. When he wakes up, he is in an infirmary; an anachronistic man comes in. He talks and gestures unintelligibly, but Farrell follows him out, seeing Xavier\u2019s scouter with port open. When Farrell follows the man, he sees Marco Four landed with the port open. Held by the guess that these people may possess higher technology and capture all of them, Farrell rushes into Marco Four, closes the port, and rises. Stryker appears and comes to him with bewilderment, driving the spaceship to land again. It is later explained that Hymenops take these people as the experimental object. The damaged ship was an expedition ship, which failed its duty. Hymenops found its derelict during their invasion and colonization of Terran planets. They put these people on the planet, made them believe that their ancestors were the crewmembers of the damaged ship, and conducted this experiment as a control group, compared to other experiments on other planets."

        "Summary_1": "Arthur Farrell is the ship\u2019s navigator, the youngest and most impulsive member of the crew. He tries to convince captain Stryker to land on Alphard Six, claiming that it cannot be inhabited. Stryker doesn\u2019t agree and orders Farrell to find a reconnaissance spiral. After the torpedo explodes near the ship, they all discuss who the attackers could be. Farrell points out that there was no sign of life on Alphard Six around the year 3000, so the inhabitants appeared after this. Farrell agrees to be sent to the planet\u2019s surface and explore. They continue talking and soon see an ancient ship in the center of the planet\u2019s town. Farrell is quick to state that it couldn\u2019t have come from Earth because it would've taken hundreds of years to travel here, and the ship\u2019s ancient technology is not effective enough for such a voyage. Irritated, he interrupts the discussion and suggests he and Xavier go down and see who the inhabitants are. Farrell flies in a helihopper and notices a bonfire near the town. He starts reporting when the helihopper\u2019s carriage crumples, an electric discharge blinds Farrell, and he momentarily loses consciousness. Later, he wakes up with a brutal headache in an infirmary inside the ancient ship. A medic with anachronistic spectacles and gray hair uses unintelligible words and gestures to Farrell to follow him. They pass several open ports, and he sees Xavier\u2019s scouter and later the Marco Four. Shocked, he runs to the spaceship and takes off, when unexpectedly Stryker appears near him, ordering him to take the ship down. Soon Gibson explains that Farrell piloted into metallic power lines, and the crash put him out for almost a day. These Alphardians are incredibly friendly. The object the crew considered a torpedo was actually an emergency boat the inhabitants sent to the spaceship to make sure the people on board noticed their colony. Their spaceship\u2019s technology set off the atomic engines of the boat, making it explode. Gibson and Xavier recognized an old language of frequency modulation the night before, heard about Farrell\u2019s crash, and landed the ship to help. It turns out that the expedition that left Terra for Sirius in 2171 perished soon, and the Bees brought the spacecraft here. They also brought some people from their peripheral colonies conditioned to believe themselves descendants of the expedition. They have been let alone. Farrell understands that the Bees were trying to monitor this group and understand humans\u2019 logic, but they never did. \n\n",

Farrell is also considered to be the youngest and most impulsive member of the crew; he also jumps to conclusions quickly and often gets corrected by either Stryker or Gibson. At the beginning of the story, Farrell is excited to go to the Alphard Six and almost forgets about the reconnaissance spiral. He tries to prove that the planet was never unreclaimed, even though the other two members are much more cautious in case there are traces left behind by the Bees. When they discuss what could be on the planet, Farrell continues to argue that the Bees never colonized Six. He also says that they might have all been the victims of a joint hallucination. He later volunteers to do the field work with Xavier, as he is sick of staying on the ship with either of the other two men. Farrell later goes down on the helihopper and goes past a hamlet when a blinding flare of electric discharge knocks him out. He later wakes up in an infirmary and believes he was taken by the enemy. However, as the medic leads him out, he realizes that these people are a result of one of the old ventures.

Following the medic out of the infirmary, Farrell marvels at the succession of rooms like the hydroponics garden and nursery that convinces him that previous old ventures on colonization had indeed succeeded.

In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

        "Summary_1": "Stryker is a crew member of the Marco Four, nominally captain of the group sent on a mission to locate the Terran slaves that were abandoned by the Bees. He seems experienced, calm, and disciplined, always following the Reclamation Handbook. Stryker has fought the Hymenops and spent a lot of time trying to understand their behavior. He values his team and doesn\u2019t want to risk them or their ship in the search for the unknown and, for example, was ready to pull Xavier back when they just detected the waves, fearing it could be something lethal. He appreciates Farrell\u2019s eagerness to find the new and enjoys bantering with him; he also respects other crew members, like Gibson and Xavier, and attentively listens to them when they discuss the origin of the atomic-powered ship. Stryker is intelligent enough to determine that this ancient ship couldn\u2019t have been constructed on this planet - it was brought from somewhere else.\n",
        "Summary_2": "Lee Stryker is one of the other members of the Terran Reclamations crew. He is the one with experience fighting the Hymenops and always cautious of any remains of the enemy. Stryker is also very careful too, constantly citing lines from the Reclamations Handbook on the ship or to Farrell. He enjoys proving Farrell wrong as well, knowing how impulsive the younger member is in most situations. Stryker\u2019s cautiousness does come in handy, as they do get into an explosion later on while in the atmosphere of the Alphard Six. Even though he is very cautious and knowledgeable, there are times where he becomes impatient out of curiosity. However, Stryker is a lot more reasonable than Farrell, rushing to land the ship again after Farrell starts it. He takes the time to explain to Farrell about their current situation as well. ",
        "Summary_3": "Stryker is the captain of the Marco Four and the crew. He is described to be the most knowledgeable, not only in regard to the Reclamations Handbook but also first hand, as he had fought the Hymenops. Physically, he has a bare fringe and a fat face. \n\nHe is intelligent as he leads the crew in theorising multiple explanations for the explosion as well as the potential inhabitants of the planet they encounter, as well as later deescalating Farrell's fear later on in the story. ",
        "Summary_4": "Stryker is the captain of the Terran Reclamation crew Marco Four. He has a Reclamations Handbook that he constantly checks. He fought with the Bees before and learned that humans and the Bees, an alien species, would never understand each other. He is also called Lee by Farrell. He likes to tease Farrell, the youngest in the crew, to teach him the importance of abiding Reclamations Handbook for safety. He is tolerant and communicative that whenever Farrell acts impulsively or argues with other crew members, he will ease Farrell\u2019s irritation and negotiate the solution among different ideas from the crew members. He is rational and practical that when all crew members theorize the possible situation after being struck, he concludes that they should investigate the land first-handly instead of denying every hypothesis."

        "Summary_1": "The Ringwave technology allowed humans to explore the neighboring systems of planets, find new habitable territories, and colonize them. It also partially leads to the invasion of the Bees and allows humans to fight with them. The knowledge about the history of the Ringwave propulsion-communication principle, especially the fact that it was discovered in 2100, also helps the crew realize that the spaceship on planet Alphard Six is atomic-powered and thus prehistoric. It\u2019s eleven hundred years old, also Terran, and was brought here from somewhere else. \n",
        "Summary_2": "The Ringwave technology is what both the Bees and humans put their faith in. Ringwave energy is said to be very reliable, capable of long-range travel. Compared to any primitive technology before, the Ringwave and its Zero Interval Transfer principle was the only way for any instantaneous communication. It has been around since 2100, completely replacing rocket propulsion because the principles were so much more advanced. Even on the Marco Four, there is a Ringwave board and Ringwave generators used for travel through space. It is significant both for the humans and the Bees because both species rely on it for exploration. When the Bees colonized and conquered the humans, they relied on this technology. During the reclamation crew\u2019s travels, they also used this technology to go to the different planets. ",
        "Summary_3": "The Ringwave technology is significant because it is what propelled Terrans forward in their technological pursuits and is what helps advance their generation. It is what allows them to pursue long-range travel and interstellar flight as the crew go about their reclamation journey. Additionally, this is the point of similarity between the Terrans and the Bees as they both rely on Ringwave energy fields over missiles as the choice weapon. \n\nIt is also significant because it highlights the difference between the Terrans and the Bees described and the Alphardians later discovered in the story. The Terrans and the Bees have access to such advanced technology that not only empowers their knowledge but their way of living, transportation, etc. In contrast, the Alphardians remain in the past with their comparatively archaic technologies and methods.",
        "Summary_4": "Ringwave technology is an energy field used for the energy source of Macro Four, the Terran Reclamation spaceship. Both humans and the alien species, Hymenops or the Bees, possess the Ringwave technology. Before the invention of Ringwave\u2019s propulsion-communication principle in 2100, humans used atomic fission and rocket propulsion. However, only the Zero Interval Transfer principle and the instantaneous communication of Ringwave technology can make long-range interstellar travel possible. Since it was invented, the atomic fission stage in technology has long been abandoned for its destructive power and incapability to sustain long-range space travel. Therefore, when the spaceship is attacked by a seemingly guided missile, which can only be equipped with atomic technology, the crew members deny all the hypotheses of the possible situation of the unobserved planet based on the technological development and the necessary time taken. Ringwave technology is significant in that the crew members theorize or assume the situation on the unobserved planet based on its existence and technological development."

A peculiar spaceship lands a few hundred yards away from his plastic igloo, and a half-dozen steel-blue creatures slide out of the airlock. When he climbs up again and sees the creatures, Jon runs for the rocky slopes. Jon brings out his stubray pistol and turns up the oxygen dial for greater exertion as two of the creatures continue to chase him. He manages to elude them by going down a dim trail temporarily. Once Jon finds the stubby bush shaped like a Maltese cross, he keeps going until he reaches the hollowed-out space. He observes the steel-blue creatures from the televisor, noting how they head towards the station to try and destroy it. Although the station is not supposed to break because it is made out of stelrylite, the creatures pound holes into the station with round-headed metal clubs. He presses the atomic cannon\u2019s firing buttons and finds that it is impossible to damage the ship. Suddenly, a Steel-Blue paralyzes him from the waist down and tells him to come with them.

He follows the Steel-Blue into the ship, where a more massive one tells Jon\u2019s Steel-Blue to examine him and give him death. The Steel-Blue brings him to the examination room, where Jon is curious about this whole interaction. He thinks about warning the SP patrol and using his weapon, but his Steel-Blue tells him they are already aware of it. The other Steel-Blues begin reproducing the service station, and Jon\u2019s Steel-Blue tells him that his torture will be dissolved in a liquid they have prepared. When he goes inside, he prepares to blast at the cylinder with his gun. However, the tentacles take it away from him and bring him a glass-like cup filled with liquid. Jon toasts to Earth and drinks the liquid, going to sleep shortly after. When he awakes again, the Steel-Blues are amazed that he is still alive. On the fifth day, Jon breaks out of his plastic bowl with his subray because he is hungry. The Steel-Blues try to torture him more with the poison, and Jon has now made it a fetish to stay alive. When Jon takes the drink from No. 1, it tells him that the SP ship will be destroyed. Jon tries to send a distress signal, and he watches as the SP ship begins to come abruptly. The Steel-Blues watch as he tries to escape, only to be greeted by the voice of a space guard. Captain Ron Small of SP-101 tells him later that the Steel-Blues fed him a liquid they feared.

Suddenly, a Steel-Blue temporarily paralyzes his legs and instructs him to follow. Karyl finds out - through an exchange of mind-reading - that these Steel-Blues are just like Earthmen as they seek out further planets to inhabit. \n\nAnother Steel-Blue instructs Karyl's Steel-Blue to examine him and then torture him, leaving him to his death. Proclaimed to be a soft-metal creature, Karyl is instructed to enter a plastic igloo. This igloo is a reproduction of Earth's atmosphere, so the Steel-Blues can observe the torture. In it, Karyl is given a series of dilutions containing a liquid that dissolves metal, with the last tumbler containing the pure liquid.

Karyl stopped for a\nmoment to examine the wreckage of the\nlock. It had been punched full of holes as\nif it had been some soft cheese instead of a\nmetal which Earthmen had spent nearly a\ncentury perfecting.\n  \n \n  \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue\nsaid. \"But that metal also is found on\nour world. It's probably the softest and most\nmalleable we have. We were surprised you\u2014earthmen,\nis it?\u2014use it as protective\nmetal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked,\nhardly expecting an answer.\n  \n \n  It came anyway. \"For the same reason you\nEarthmen are reaching out farther into your\nsystem. We need living room. You have\nstrategically placed planets for our use. We\nwill use them.\"\n  \n \n  Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had\nbeen preaching preparedness as Earth flung\nher ships into the reaches of the solar system,\ntaking the first long step toward the\nconquest of space.\n  \n \n  There are other races somewhere, they\nargued. As strong and smart as man, many\nof them so transcending man in mental and\ninventive power that we must be prepared to\nstrike the minute danger shows.\n  \n \n  Now here was the answer to the scientists'\nwarning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.\n  \n \n  \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue.\n\"I couldn't understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered.\nIt was a welcome surprise. Apparently his\nthoughts had to be directed outward, rather\nthan inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to\nread it.\n  \n \n  He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping\nlock of the invaders' space ship wondering\nhow he could warn Earth. The Space\nPatrol cruiser was due in for refueling at\nhis service station in 21 days. But by that\ntime he probably would be mouldering in\nthe rocky dust of the asteroid.\n  \n \n  It was pitch dark within the ship but the\nSteel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all\nmaneuvering through the maze of corridors.\nJon followed him, attached to one tentacle.\n  \n \n  Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular\nroom, bright with light streaming from\na glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently\nwere near topside of the vessel.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue, more massive than his\nguide and with four more pair of tentacles,\nincluding two short ones that grew from the\ntop of its head, spoke out.\n  \n \n  \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue\nnodded.\n  \n \n  \"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\"\nJon's guide added.\n  \n \n  \"Examine him first, then give him the\ndeath.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from\nthe lighted room through more corridors.\nIf it got too bad he still had the stubray\npistol.\n  \n \n  Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on\nthe lonely, nerve-wracking job of service\nstation attendant just to see what it offered.\n  \n \n  Here was a part of it, and it was certainly\nsomething new.\n  \n \n  \"This is the examination room,\" his\nSteel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.\n  \n \n  A green effulgence surrounded him.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\n  There\n  , just ahead of him, was the lock\nleading into the service station. Slipping\na key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,\nhe jabbed it into the center of the lock,\nopening the lever housing.\n  \n \n  He pulled strongly on the lever. With a\nhiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.\nJon Karyl darted inside, the door closing\nsoftly behind.\n  \n \n  At the end of the long tunnel he stepped\nto the televisor which was fixed on the area\nsurrounding the station.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.\nBut he saw their ship. It squatted\nlike a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut\ntight.\n  \n \n  He tuned the televisor to its widest range\nand finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.\nHe was looking into the stationary rocket\nengine.\n  \n \n  As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue\ncame crawling out of the ship.\n  \n \n  The two Steel-Blues moved toward the\ncenter of the televisor range. They're coming\ntoward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n  \n \n  Karyl examined the two creatures. They\nwere of the steel-blue color from the crown\nof their egg-shaped heads to the tips of\ntheir walking appendages.\n  \n \n  They were about the height of Karyl\u2014six\nfeet. But where he tapered from broad\nshoulders to flat hips, they were straight up\nand down. They had no legs, just appendages,\nmany-jointed that stretched and\nshrank independent of the other, but keeping\nthe cylindrical body with its four pairs\nof tentacles on a level balance.\n  \n \n  Where their eyes would have been was\nan elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the\negg-head, with its converging ends curving\naround the sides of the head.\n  \n \n  Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But\nwhere were their masters?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues moved out of the range\nof the televisor. A minute later Jon heard\na pounding from the station upstairs.\n  \n \n  He chuckled. They were like the wolf of\npre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to\nblow the house down.\n  \n \n  The outer shell of the station was formed\nfrom stelrylite, the toughest metal in the\nsolar system. With the self-sealing lock of\nthe same resistant material, a mere pounding\nwas nothing.\n  \n \n  Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.\nHe went up the steel ladder leading to the\nstation's power plant and the televisor that\ncould look into every room within the\nstation.\n  \n \n  He heaved a slight sigh when he reached\nthe power room, for right at his hand were\nweapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n  \n \n  Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the\nlock to the station. His teeth suddenly\nclamped down on his lower lip.\n  \n \n  Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes\ninto the stelrylite with round-headed metal\nclubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't\nbreak up that easily.\n  \n \n  Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up\nthe revolving turret which capped the station\nso that its thin fin pointed at the\nsquat ship of the invaders.\n  \n \n  Then he went to the atomic cannon's\nfiring buttons.\n  \n \n  He pressed first the yellow, then the blue\nbutton. Finally the red one.\n  \n \n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n  \n \n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n  \n \n  He pressed the red button again.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n  \n \n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n  \n \n  He turned his head.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n  \n \n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n  \n \n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n  \n \n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n  \n \n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n  \n \n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be\nfriends.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled.\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The Steel-Blue creatures are described to be steel-blue in color. They have egg-shaped heads and walking appendages. The Steel-Blues are also around the height of Jon at six feet, and their appendages are many-jointed. These appendages also stretch and shrink independent of each other, but the cylindrical body and tentacles are kept on a level balance. Instead of eyes, the Steel-Blues have elliptical-shaped lenses that cover half of the head and converge around the sides of the head. Jon notes that they are robots without masters. When Jon follows the Steel-Blue later, he notes that it has a lens on the back of its head as well. The massive steel-blue creature that Jon meets has four more tentacles, including two short ones that grow out of its head. ",
        "Summary_2": "These creatures - robots - are steel-blue in nature with egg shaped heads. They stand at about six feet tall and have a rectangular-like stature with flexible appendages (able to move independently of each other), a cylindrical body, and ellipitcal-shaped lens for eyes that are present both on the front and back of their head. \n\nSome of the creatures, unlike Jon's Steel-Blue, also have more tentacles that also grew atop their heads. These tentacles were able to move like limbs, for example, it was able to grab the glass containing the yellowish liquid. ",
        "Summary_3": "Steel-Blue is around six feet high. Their head shape looks like an egg, colored Steel-Blue. Each has four pairs of independently jointed forked tentacles, stretching from their cylindrical body, which let them move. Their body shape is straight without the curve of the shoulder or hip. Elliptical-shaped lenses cover their heads for both the front and the back of their heads, whose ends wind around the side. They look like robots. They communicate with telepathy. The leader of the Steel-Blue, No. 1, is more massive than the normal ones and has four more pairs of tentacles, two of which are shorter and stretch out from its head.",
        "Summary_4": "The creatures are described as being of a steel-blue color. They are six feet tall, and they have egg shaped heads. They don\u2019t have any legs or hands, instead they have appendages that allow them to move. They are cylindrical, and have 4 tentacles that allow them to fight and grab things. Instead of eyes they have elliptical shaped lenses that allow them to see, and they also have lenses on the back of their head, which allows them to see. They also communicate with Jon via telepathy, and they can read his mind. "

He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  .

The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  .

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship.

        "Summary_1": "The story is initially set on an asteroid, where a stationary rocket station is. Jon has a blue plastic igloo to live in. There is also a ravine where he runs to in an attempt to elude the Steel-Blues. There are bushes, water, and dense thicket that he must go through before getting to the hollowed-out space in the center. At the station, there is a lock for his key to go through. The lever then opens to a long tunnel, and there is a televisor that fixes on the area. The station is made out of stelrylite, but it becomes riddled with holes after the Steel-Blues attack. The station also has a row of studs and a revolving turret that fires atomic cannons. There is a yellow, blue, and red button to fire. The Blue Steels\u2019 spaceship can change its part to a bubble-like metal. The spaceship of the invaders is pitch-black and is a maze-like corridor. At the end, there is a circular room with bright light streaming from a glass-like and bulging skylight. In the examination room, the Steel-Blues build a miniature reproduction of the space station with plastic walls. There is a small opening in the four foot cylinder that brings him a strange liquid. Although the Steel-Blues are always present, the tank they keep him in is fairly easy to break out of. ",
        "Summary_2": "This setting occurs in the same system as Earth, inhabited both by humans and the Steel-Blue creatures. More specifically, this story takes place aboard the Steel-Blues' ship. Karyl encounters many rooms including the examination room, but the majority of the story has him in a clear plastic igloo by which is he observed by the creatures. The igloo is a miniature recreation of the service station with a lock outside. \n\nAt the end of the story, Karyl is saved and the setting changes to be onboard the Space Patrol ship, where he is safe and recovering.",
        "Summary_3": "The story happens on an asteroid under the control of the earthman. The surface of the asteroid is rocky and uneven. The service station is underground of a ravine, whose surface is filled with man-high bushes. Its entrance is hidden underneath a dense thicket around the hairpin turn of the old watercourse. In the center of the hollowed-out space lies a self-sealing lock, which is the door of the entrance. Behind the door, there is a long tunnel, the end of which is a room surrounded by the televisors. A steel ladder leads to the station\u2019s power plant room, which is also equipped with televisors that can watch all the rooms in the station. There are weapons stored in the power room. The station is capped with a revolving turret. The outer shell of the service station, including the entrance door, is constituted by stelrylite, the toughest metal in Earthman\u2019s knowledge. The blue spaceship lies near the stationary rocket engine outside the service station.  Inside the blue spaceship, it is dark and mazed with corridors. There is a circular room lighted with a bulging skylight, where the leader of the Steel-Blues is. \n\nThe Steel-Blues build a smaller plastic igloo, similar to the one in the service station, to serve as the prison for Jon to torture him. There are instruments ranged inside, such as an air pump from the station and a pallet laid inside. The wall is made of clear plastic. The atmosphere inside is reproduced as the one in the service station, only with more proportion of the oxygen. There is a cylinder whose center can open, where it usually sits a glass tumbler containing a yellowish liquid that is claimed to be the harmful liquid to torture Jon. The cylinder is equipped with tentacles that can control Jon to drink the liquid and take down his defense.\n",
        "Summary_4": "The story is located in a small asteroid that is described to be barren and empty, with gray rocks. The asteroid only has a single base, which is where Jon lives alone. There is also a ravine with plants that allow Jon to hide a secondary entry to his base, which is the one that he uses to get away from the steel-blues initially. When Jon gets captured, he is taken to the ship of the steel-blues, and he learns that they made a smaller replica of his base because they want him to die happily. "

        "Article": "\n  There\n  , just ahead of him, was the lock\nleading into the service station. Slipping\na key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,\nhe jabbed it into the center of the lock,\nopening the lever housing.\n  \n \n  He pulled strongly on the lever. With a\nhiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.\nJon Karyl darted inside, the door closing\nsoftly behind.\n  \n \n  At the end of the long tunnel he stepped\nto the televisor which was fixed on the area\nsurrounding the station.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.\nBut he saw their ship. It squatted\nlike a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut\ntight.\n  \n \n  He tuned the televisor to its widest range\nand finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.\nHe was looking into the stationary rocket\nengine.\n  \n \n  As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue\ncame crawling out of the ship.\n  \n \n  The two Steel-Blues moved toward the\ncenter of the televisor range. They're coming\ntoward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n  \n \n  Karyl examined the two creatures. They\nwere of the steel-blue color from the crown\nof their egg-shaped heads to the tips of\ntheir walking appendages.\n  \n \n  They were about the height of Karyl\u2014six\nfeet. But where he tapered from broad\nshoulders to flat hips, they were straight up\nand down. They had no legs, just appendages,\nmany-jointed that stretched and\nshrank independent of the other, but keeping\nthe cylindrical body with its four pairs\nof tentacles on a level balance.\n  \n \n  Where their eyes would have been was\nan elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the\negg-head, with its converging ends curving\naround the sides of the head.\n  \n \n  Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But\nwhere were their masters?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues moved out of the range\nof the televisor. A minute later Jon heard\na pounding from the station upstairs.\n  \n \n  He chuckled. They were like the wolf of\npre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to\nblow the house down.\n  \n \n  The outer shell of the station was formed\nfrom stelrylite, the toughest metal in the\nsolar system. With the self-sealing lock of\nthe same resistant material, a mere pounding\nwas nothing.\n  \n \n  Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.\nHe went up the steel ladder leading to the\nstation's power plant and the televisor that\ncould look into every room within the\nstation.\n  \n \n  He heaved a slight sigh when he reached\nthe power room, for right at his hand were\nweapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n  \n \n  Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the\nlock to the station. His teeth suddenly\nclamped down on his lower lip.\n  \n \n  Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes\ninto the stelrylite with round-headed metal\nclubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't\nbreak up that easily.\n  \n \n  Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up\nthe revolving turret which capped the station\nso that its thin fin pointed at the\nsquat ship of the invaders.\n  \n \n  Then he went to the atomic cannon's\nfiring buttons.\n  \n \n  He pressed first the yellow, then the blue\nbutton. Finally the red one.\n  \n \n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n  \n \n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n  \n \n  He pressed the red button again.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n  \n \n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n  \n \n  He turned his head.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n  \n \n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n  \n \n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n  \n \n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n  \n \n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n  \n \n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply.

But when I drank that last\nglass, I knew they didn't have a chance.\n  \n \n  \"They were metal monsters. No wonder\nthey feared that liquid.

The Steel-Blue also explains to him that the metal they use at the station is considered to be the softest one from where the Space Blue\u2019s come from. It is not openly hostile towards him, but it does speak almost contemptuously when they go to the examination room. Although his Steel Blue initially did not show much hostility, it does warn him to not even think about contacting the SP ship or using his weapon. However, it does tease him and say that he gets absent-minded at times. When it tells him about the torture, his Blue Steel speaks in an almost-caressing way as well. When Jon breaks out of his tank to find food, his Steel-Blue tells him that it is the first of the creatures that he has met. It commands him to go back to the tank.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty.

The man realizes that Hogey is Marie\u2019s husband through the conversation, so he drives Hogey to a place near Marie\u2019s house. Hogey takes a nap in the grass near the ditch until the night. He swallows a few gins, checks the time with the star's position in the sky as he pawns his watch in the poker game that he lost all of the money, and walks toward the house. He is afraid of facing his wife and son as he lost all the money in a poker game two weeks ago after his wife had waited for him for so long to do all the space travel to earn money. He wants to run away. He walks through the fence, trampling through some boards when the dog barks. He hides in the shadow of the peach tree when Marie\u2019s brother comes out to check. The dog comes at him, and Hogey calms the dog, waiting until the man goes inside the house. When Hogey keeps walking, he steps into a concrete mixer with sand and falls. He takes off his shoes and puts his bare feet back in the muddy sand. Laying on the sand, Hogey falls asleep. Past midnight, he gets awakened by the dog's licking, finding his feet stuck in the concrete. Reflecting on his time in the space and the people there, Hogey feels desperate. Suddenly, he hears his son cry. The cry brings Hogey\u2019s consciousness back from the space to where he is, and the significance of his family strikes him. He calls out loud for help and sobs with his feet stuck tight. He will live on Earth with gravity from now on.\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story focuses on a man named Hogey. Hogey is trying to return to his wife and child, but seems to find it very difficult because he has been drinking, and because his body needs to adapt to being back on Earth. The story begins in a bus, where Hogey is very drunk and is trying to talk to other passengers. The other passengers help Hogey sleep, but he wakes up again and continues speaking with others. When the bus reaches his stop, Hogey clumsily gets off the bus. When the driver sees that Hogey needs help, he helps Hogey sit down in the street and tells him to wait for a ride instead of walking to his wife\u2019s house. Hogey waits for a while, then decides to walk. He falls in a ditch, but he is helped by a couple who passes in a car. The man tells him that his wife remarried and that he is going to the new husband\u2019s house. After the man drops him off, Hogey falls asleep close to the house. He sleeps for a while and afterwards he tries to go into the house, but he struggles mentally to accept what he is doing. He ends up falling in cement, and his feet get stuck. We learn that Hogey worked in space a lot, and that he was afraid to go back to earth because of the amount of time that he had been away. \n\n",
        "Summary_4": "Everybody immediately knows that Big Hogey Parker is a spacer and goes out of their way to help him even if he is harassing a housewife. He reveals that he was kidding about being an Indian, and there are two men who lead him back to his seat. When the driver threatens to turn him over, Big Hogey apologizes and sits in his seat until it is time to leave, and the driver asks if he is okay once he staggers to cross the highway. The man asks if somebody is supposed to meet Big Hogey, but he says that it is a surprise for everybody. He is redirected to sit at the culvert, but gravity makes it difficult for him to walk. As the sun sets, Hogey stares at it because he hates it for what it truly is and what it did to his eyes. A burly farmer angrily confronts him when he stumbles down the road again, but he reveals that he is married to Marie Hauptman. They offer to drop him off at the area near Hauptman's road, and Hogey finds himself too tired to go on because it is twilight. When he awakes again, it is night time. He takes another sip of his gin and decides how the meeting will go. Hogey is worried about the money, especially since he has gone on six hitches in space with the promise that each one would be his last one. As he goes near the house, a dog suddenly comes out and barks. One of Marie\u2019s brothers comes out to investigate the situation too, but he finds nothing and returns home with the dog. He tries to think about why a tumbler like him would be married with a son, and he finds both his feet losing the strength to move. The dog, Hooky, comes up to greet him again, but he angrily sends it away. Hogey thinks back to his crew, and a baby begins to cry suddenly. He yells for help, and the lights come on again because the baby begins to cry more. The kid had been an accident, and he knows that a tumblr has no business with a family. However, there is nobody to blame for this. Big Hogey sits with his foot locked in the solid concrete and sobs when the rest of the men find him. "

        "Summary_1": "There is an ironic significance in Hogey\u2019s feet being stuck in concrete. Throughout the story, Hogey\u2019s identity is tied to being a tumbler - a spaceman. Not only does he physically look like a spacer with his sun-burned marks from his goggles, he has also been blinded by the sun\u2019s glare. It is only due to these characteristics that other people give him allowances while Hogey is in a drunken stupor. \n\nHogey constantly speaks to separate himself from everyone else - even his wife - by identifying as a tumbler and them as hoofers. He insists that he was born as a tumbler and belongs in space, and hence blames his drunken inability to walk as due to a difficulty in adjusting to the gravity on Earth. He insists that he has to become a hoofer, but refuses to, and at the end of the story even denounces his wife and child. It is ironic then, that by Hogey\u2019s feet being stuck in the concrete, he has reluctantly become a hoofer as his feet are literally encased in the Earth. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Before Hogey\u2019s feet are stuck in concrete, he keeps thinking about his time in space, despising people who live on Earth as he believes the spacers know what truly lies behind the fake phenomenon of the sun and moon seen from the Earth. He doesn\u2019t realize the reality of living on Earth and the significance of his family. After Hogey\u2019s feet are stuck in concrete, he hears his son crying when he is lying on the ground and trying to get his feet out of the concrete. The crying of the firstborn reminds him of the reality that he will live on Earth, with gravity, in the future. There will be no more space travel for him but maybe his son. He used to blame his return on his son and the overall situation, but after being stuck in the concrete and hearing his son crying, he realizes that it is not anyone\u2019s fault that he is strongly influenced by the space life and fails to fulfill his responsibilities as a father and a husband. It is nobody\u2019s but his fault for all the things that happened. He feels belonging to Earth after his feet are physically stuck tight to the earth.",

Hogey doesn\u2019t seem to care and falls asleep with his feet still inside. He wakes up a few hours later with the dog licking him, and he realizes that he was actually stuck in concrete.

The concrete also forces him to confront his fears, even if he is not sure what he will say to Marie about money when he sees her. He contemplates leaving Hauptman's house a lot, but the concrete forces him to stay until he is found and brought back into the family. In a way, the concrete also makes him become a hoofer despite him constantly referring to himself as being different from everybody else. With his feet grounded to the earth, he has no choice but to also become a hoofer like everybody else. "

A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\n  \n \n  What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n  \n \n  A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n  \n \n  Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot.

And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time.

In addition, a tumbler is not meant to be a family man, and should neither have a wife nor children. \n\nTherefore, a hoofer is a person who lives on Earth and is rooted to the ground by gravity, as they have never traveled to space. By contrast, they would have a family, like Marie Parker does with her son. In addition, the hoofers in this story are stable and kind, like the farmer and the bus driver, who all help Hogey when his limbs and center of gravity fail him. \n",
        "Summary_2": "A tumbler is a person who lives in space, where there is no gravity. They may fear to be in an open space as a result of staying in the outer space too long. Their legs are not used to the gravity, which makes them hard to walk properly on Earth. They can naturally equate time to position. They have bad visions because their eyes are harmed by the direct contact to the sun. Their faces are harmed by the direct exposure to the sun in the space. Sun looks brightly pain and white to them as they see it in the bottomless dark space where sun is the largest source of light. A hoofer is a person who lives on Earth where there is gravity. They are used to walk with gravity, unlike a tumbler. Sun looks red to them when it sets. Their visions are not harmed by the direct exposure to the sun, neither are their faces.",
        "Summary_3": "Hoofers are humans that have stayed on Earth all their life. They are everyday humans that live their lives without ever going to space. The bus driver, and Hogey\u2019s wife are examples of Hoofers. Tumblers on the other hand are people that have traveled to space, and worked there. Hogey is an example of a tumbler, and is an example of all the problems that tumblers face when they go back to Earth. Tumbler\u2019s aren\u2019t allowed to have children, a rule that Hogey broke. Hogey also struggles a lot with Earth\u2019s gravity, because tumblers spend a lot of time in space in which there is no gravity. ",
        "Summary_4": "A hoofer is an ordinary human who lives on Earth. They do not go to space at all, and they spend their lives on the planet. Everybody who Big Hogey meets on his way home is considered to be a hoofer because they have never been to space before. Compared to being a hoofer, a tumbler is somebody who has spent most of their time in space. People, like Big Hogey, find it difficult to adjust to gravity after having spent so much time away from Earth. The tumblers are also not meant to have a family, as fathers are not supposed to be allowed into space. The hoofers, on the other hand, can have regular families and go about their daily lives because they do not have to abide by the same requirements as the tumblers have to for their line of work. The tumblers also go on multiple space hitches, despite the promise of money. "

        "Summary_1": "This story takes place on Earth. As we are following the protagonist\u2019s journey home, the setting constantly changes in terms of transportation mode and the landscape. First, we can identify the setting as a public bus, where Hogey occupies the back seats of the bus as he falls asleep clutching his gin. Hogey gets off at his stop - Caine\u2019s junction - which is a road junction with just a few farmhouses at the side and a derelict filling station. There is also a ditch, which he promptly stumbles into. The landscape reveals the Great Plains country, with descriptions of the setting being treeless and barren, and instead being full of rolling hills and fields of grass.\n\nTowards the end of the story, the setting changes to the Hauptman\u2019s place where the farmhouse sits off the side of the road with a barbed-wire fence. Within the tall grass of the farmhouse also lies a sloppy heap of sand - concrete. \n",
        "Summary_2": "It is in late August. The first scene is on a bus. After the protagonist gets out of the bus, he sits at a road junction. Along the side of the road, there is gravel. Next to the railroad tracks, a freight building, several farmhouses, and a filling station stand across the road. The land is barren, unwooded, and rolling. The hills around are dusty. There is a ditch along the road, the bottom of which is wet and muddy. The protagonist\u2019s house is about three miles from there. A wheat field and a few trees surround the house. Beyond the ditch next to the road, a tall grass lies. Six miles away to the west, there is a rocket launching station. A narrow path along with the barbed-wire fence leads toward the house. The hedge divides the peach trees from the field inside the fence gap. Some old boards, a shovel and pick, a sand pile, a stack of new lumbers, and a concrete mixer lie on the ground. There is a porch light next to the screen door of the house. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story takes place on Earth. It starts off in a bus, and then it continues to be set in what seems to be a side road off a highway. Hogey is on his way to his house, which is described to be isolated, like a farmhouse. The house is big and has dogs, which make it more similar to a farmhouse. Hogey also remembers his time in space, which was described as a floating station full of tubes and metal machines that continued falling, and the people inside fell with it. The story seems to be set in the future, but it could very well be set only a few from now. ",

There is a highway near the area where Hogey is dropped off, and he falls into a ditch when the sun goes down. There is a farm road to go into, and a side-road for cars to turn onto. At Hauptman's road, there is a narrow drive that leads to the barbed wire of the farmhouse. There is also a peach tree next to the house, and a porch.

Ed tells the owners of other shops, trying to figure out the situation. However, both the owners think it is normal. After realizing he is the only one who feels strange, Ed gets closer to the hanged body, noticing that it\u2019s a stranger. He bumps into Jenkins, a stationary clerk.

He cautiously leaves and takes the bus. People on the bus are mind-controlled. A man with a book is looking at him, and Ed guesses the identity of the seemingly mind-clear man. When another older man ascends the bus and looks at the man with the book, Ed realizes the strangeness and escapes from the bus.

As he brings his car around, he realizes that it is a human body. Loyce tells his co-workers Don Fergusson and Jack Potter about the body, but they seem untroubled about it. Nobody pays attention to the body, and Loyce feels sick. He bumps into Jenkins and Margaret Henderson, both who assume that he is sick because of his reactions. Two cops show up, and they tell him that he missed the announcement earlier today. As he gets into the police car, he realizes that they weren\u2019t cops in Pikeville. Loyce manages to get away, stopping at the entrance of an alley. He heads towards the City Hall and sees fluttering shapes from the sky. The shapes are similar to giant insects with wings, and he wonders if there are more. Loyce realizes that they are aliens with the ability to change into man, and he boards a bus to get out of the area. Everyone seems fairly normal, but he notices a man watching him with shrewd eyes. He rushes out of the bus, and the man follows him. Loyce strikes the man with a rock and runs away as other people begin to gather. Janet asks what is happening when he returns him, and he tells her that the entire town is under control of the aliens now. The twins are called down, as Loyce tells him that they are going on a ride. Suddenly, there is a buzz and one of the aliens that bears a resemblance to Jimmy hurls itself at him. Loyce stabs it, realizing that his wife and other son are also controlled because of how expressionless they are. Eventually, he reaches Oak Grove and talks to the Commissioner. The Commissioner explains that he thinks this has been going on for a long time, and Loyce thinks about the man he accidentally killed. It turns out that the dead man was bait to draw out who had escaped, and the Commissioner tells him to come along as there is no time to waste.

While searching for a parking spot, he notices some bundle hanging from a lamppost in a town park, not far from his store. Moments later, he realizes it\u2019s a human body. Loyce is shocked and starts asking his salesman Don Fergusson about the body but gets an indefinite answer. Jack Potter, a shoe shop\u2019s employee, also calmly states that there has to be some valid reason behind it. Don goes back to work, surprisingly unbothered. Ed walks to the park to look at the dead man: not a local, his skin is cut gouged. Ed then meets a clerk named Jenkins, who asks why Ed looks sick. Loyce becomes hysterical, and people start gathering around him, wondering why someone is screaming. Two cops detain him and decide to drive Ed to the Hall of Justice. They start asking questions: his name, where he was during the day. Ed knows they are not real policemen - he knows all the cops of Pikeville - and eventually jumps out of the car when it slows down. He runs away and then sees a splotch of darkness above the City Hall and some alien figures coming through this slit. They can disguise themselves as men. He gets on the bus and inspects the other passengers - they seem to be under the influence of the alien creatures. Two men look at Ed with suspicion, and he quickly gets off the bus. He kills one of them with a rock while running away. Ed comes home and orders his wife and kids to get ready to leave the town immediately. His younger son seems to be under the control of a small alien. Ed stabs the creature, killing it. His wife and the other son are not reacting - they are subservient to the aliens, too. Ed runs away alone. He gets to a patrol station after crawling and limping for ten miles. The station\u2019s attendant hears Ed\u2019s story and looks confused. Loyce asks the man to get him to Oak Grove. Later, he tells his story to the Commissioner of Oak Grove, the officer believes him. Ed suggests that these creatures have been inhabiting the planet\u2019s towns for a long time. He thinks the Jewish people defeated them and showed it in the Bible, illustrating Beelzebub as a giant fly, an alien insect. The Commissioner then explains that the dead body probably served as bait for people who were not yet under the aliens\u2019 control. He asks Loyce to come with him somewhere. In the next scene, the vice president of the Oak Grove Merchants\u2019 Bank leaves work after spending the day in the vault, examining deposit boxes.

The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Edward C. Loyce has been the owner of the TV sales store in the town for twenty-five years, and he is also called Ed by the town people. He is forty years old, living at 1368 Hurst Road, Pikeville. He has a wife, Janet, and twin sons, Jimmy and Tommy. He owns a Packard. He is practical and always tries to correct wrong things. He is friendly because he knows everyone in the town, and everyone seems to have a good relationship with him. Ed is brave because when he realizes that nobody pays attention to the hanged body in the town park, he gets closer and tries to figure out who the corpse is. Ed is also brilliant because he grasps the abnormal situations immediately after noticing the difference between the current situation and the normal one and because he sees the alien\u2019s power flaws right after knowing the situation. He is also practical because he plans what he should do right after grasping the situation in the town. He is cautious as he kills the man with the book on the bus, not letting the aliens' slight chance get him. His will is formidable because he runs with his feet for ten miles along the rough ground to escape from Pikeville and because he makes the decision immediately when he knows that he has to abandon his family.",
        "Summary_2": "Edward C. Loyce is a man who lives in a small town, and is the owner of a TV sales store. He seems to be very intelligent, determined and can handle himself in a fight. Once Ed is put in a situation in which he is in danger, he immediately starts to think about what he can do to survive. He did this in the police car, in the bus and in his house when he had to kill one of his children. He is also described as a practical man. ",
        "Summary_3": "Edward C. Loyce is the owner of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICES. He is married to his wife Janet; he also has two twin sons named Jimmy and Tommy. Loyce is described to be a forty year old man. He is also a very brave person, being unafraid to stab the alien that hurled itself at him even when it bore a vague resemblance to his son. He also chose to act quickly after seeing the aliens go to the City Hall. Loyce is also very perceptive as well, realizing that the two cops weren\u2019t actually cops because he knew every cop in Pikeville. Even though he is very perceptive, it can cause him to become overly-paranoid as he accidentally killed one of the other men who escaped the alien control because he suspected that the man was one of the aliens. He is shown to love his family very much, choosing to go back for them in hopes that the whole town is not completely controlled yet",
        "Summary_4": "Edward C. Loyce is a forty-year-old citizen of Pikeville. He owns Loyce TV sales and service store. At the beginning, we learn that he is a practical person. He is friendly and approachable, many people know him and his store, and he\u2019s also met every police officer in the town. He is terrified by death and instantly starts looking for something that could explain a dead body hanging from a lamppost. He\u2019s also quite shrewd and good at pretending. We see that, when he manages to deceive two cops and escape after he realizes that they are not real police officers. He also shows his intellect when sharing his assumption regarding the creatures and referencing the biblical image. He cares for his family and tries to take them with him, to hide them from the alien creatures but is then forced to leave them. \n"

        "Query": "What is the significance of the hanged human body in THE HANGING STRANGER story?",
        "Article": " \n  THE HANGING STRANGER\n  \n \n  BY PHILIP K. DICK\n  \n \n  ILLUSTRATED BY SMITH\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Science Fiction\nAdventures Magazine December 1953. Extensive research did not uncover\nany evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n Ed had always been a practical man, when he saw something was\nwrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw\n  \n  it\n  \n hanging in the\ntown square.\n  \n  Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car\nout and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His\nback and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and\nwheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done\nokay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n  \n \n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n  \n \n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "The hanged human body is bait to lure people who escape successfully from the mind control of alien flies and draw themselves out. People who are not under mental control would try everything they can to escape from the controlled town to the nearby uncontrolled town, but when they arrive in the uncontrolled town, they will be hanged as another bait in the new town, just like what happens to Ed Loyce in the story. When Ed notices the hanged body in the park and the strangeness that nobody cares about, he tries everything to alert people and escape. Yet, he ends up being suspended by the Commissioner in the town nearby as a new bait to lure people like him. The fact that the uncontrolled person escapes from the controlled town is also why the hanged body looks like a stranger in a town because the person often comes from another town. This fact also constitutes why the body is caked with mud, and its clothes are torn and ripped because it is the consequence of a long journey from another town to where it is hanged.",
        "Summary_2": "The hanging body is an important part of the story because it is what tells Ed that something is wrong with the people around him. When Ed sees the hanging body in the middle of the town square, he tries to tell everyone around that something is wrong, but no one seems to care. At the end, Ed figures out that the body was used by the aliens to lure out the humans that they hadn\u2019t controlled yet, which is exactly what happened to him. Also, it is insinuated that Ed was killed and hanged in another town to repeat the same cycle again. ",
        "Summary_3": "The hanged human body is supposed to be a bait for the aliens to figure out who has escaped their control. As an escaped person would not have received the announcement that there was a body being hanged, it would allow them to better capture the escaped person. The hanged human body is also implied to be another person who escaped, because Clarence Mason also sees a body that is hanging. Since both Ed Loyce and Clarence Mason had a freak chance of not being infected by the aliens, because they were not present for the so-called \u201cannouncement\u201d of the hanged body, it also makes them targets. For Loyce, the hanged body is the start of his observation of the aliens and realization that the entire town is under control. \n",
        "Summary_4": "This body serves as bait to help the alien insects find people that are not yet under their control. The body draws Ed\u2019s attention, and eventually, he gets taken by the aliens disguised as police officers. It helps him initially realize that something has changed the town's citizens. He soon finds out that Pikeville has been invaded by some aliens. At the end, we also learn that this hanging man was probably a citizen of some nearby town who, just like Loyce, managed to escape the alien insects and come to Pikeville to get help. These insects have invaded more than one city. They kill survivors to make them serve as baits for future survivors. "

Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\n  \n \n  A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly.

We had an audience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets\nexactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n  \n \n  \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't\nhave to identify them as their species.

To\nher, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n  \n \n  They went to his cabin.\n  \n \n  She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\nwasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\nlong and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\nexcept for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\nthe difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\ndevelopment, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\nthe violet end of the spectrum.\n  \n \n  She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\nprimeval Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\nher own world. She had something else in mind.\n  \n \n  \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\nhave subhuman monsters.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\nIt had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\nsurface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\nthem start lower than I am?\"\n  \n \n  The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\nit governed personal relations between races that were united against\nnon-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n  \n \n  \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n  \n \n  It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\npermanent union.\n  \n \n  \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n  \n \n  \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction.

Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the\nCity Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of\nsome kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest\u2014and then crawled\ncrab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n  \n \n  He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he\nshuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the\nCity Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of\nthe building and halting for a moment before going on.\n  \n \n  Were there more of them?\n  \n \n  It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm\nweren't men. They were alien\u2014from some other world, some other\ndimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the\nuniverse. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm\nof being.\n  \n \n  On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved\ntoward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter\nthe City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n  \n \n  Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight,\nclutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly\nfluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and\ncame to rest among them.\n  \n \n  Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves\nas men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration.\nMimicry.\n  \n \n  Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The\nalley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe\ndarkness made no difference to them.\n  \n \n  He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and\nwomen flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting\ngroups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the\nevening gloom.\n  \n \n  Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the\nbus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A\nmoment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The alien flies have multi-lensed inhuman eyes, wings, and a stinger. They are dark, coming from another dimension. They look like giant insects in their original form. When they move, they will produce a buzzing sound. They can mimic the appearance of humans, and they can control human minds. However, their mind control ability has its limit that they can control one area at one time, starting from the highest authority and widening down the control in a circle. When they control the whole town, they move to another area to continue. Their power flaw makes them unable to control everyone that someone may be overlooked. When that is the case, they set up a trap, using people who escape from the controlled town as bait to hang them in public, to lure people who are not under control to come to them by themselves. They anticipate their failures and are smart enough to make up for their flaws.",
        "Summary_2": "The alien flies are the creatures that invaded Ed\u2019s town and started to control everyone. They entered the town above town hall through a portal-like chasm in swarms. They were described as large bugs, with human characteristics. They could easily imitate humans, which is why it was hard at first for Ed to distinguish who was who. They are described as violent and fearless, but they weren\u2019t omnipotent. They made mistakes when controlling people, which is what allowed Ed to initially be free of their control. ",
        "Summary_3": "The alien flies are a strange type of species that have come in hopes of controlling the entire town. The Commissioner says that he has a theory of who they are. Most of the alien flies try to take over one area at a time, starting from the highest level and working down to widen the circle. Eventually, they move to a different town once the one they are currently controlling is firmly in their grasp. This has also been happening for thousands of years. Physically, they are giant insects with wings, capable of blending in as pseudo-men. When the one that resembles Jimmy attacks Loyce, he notes that it has wings and cold in-human eyes. There is also a stinger when it turns its body. The alien flies are dedicated to carrying out their mission of controlling the entire town. They do not have any personal emotions, but they are willing to get rid of any obstacle that stands in their way. The flies are very intelligent too, capable of mimicking humans almost perfectly and using bait to draw out the escaped ones. ",
        "Summary_4": "The alien flies are some unknown creatures that came to Pikeville through a slit in the shell of the universe and occupied the town\u2019s citizens\u2019 minds and bodies. They have been doing this for thousands of years - Ed remembered their image was in the Bible. They are smart and can disguise themselves as humans. They also can anticipate their own mistakes and create certain mechanisms to locate people whose minds they haven\u2019t yet invaded. For example, they hang dead bodies in the central part of a town. This image can disturb only ones who are not aware of the aliens. \n\n"

DICK\n  \n \n  ILLUSTRATED BY SMITH\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Science Fiction\nAdventures Magazine December 1953. Extensive research did not uncover\nany evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n Ed had always been a practical man, when he saw something was\nwrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw\n  \n  it\n  \n hanging in the\ntown square.\n  \n  Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car\nout and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His\nback and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and\nwheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done\nokay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n  \n \n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n  \n \n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The story happens in Pikeville town and Oak Grove town. The first scene occurs in the town park where the hanged body is. In the park, there is a lamppost, a drinking fountain, and a bench. Under the lamppost, the body is hanged. The second scene is in the car, where Ed has a conversation with the fake police. When Ed escapes from the fake police, he runs into a hardware store filled with customers and clerks. There is a back door in the shipping room, a garbage can next to the door, and concrete stairs outside the store towards the top of the fence. The other side of the fence is an entrance to an alley, which is filled with boards and ruined boxes and tires. Passing the loading platform of a grocery store stands one wall of the Hall of Justice. The wall is white with barred windows. The City Hall is next to the police station, with yellow wooden walls with brass cement steps. Cedars and flowers are planted on each side of the entrance. \n\nWhen Ed gets on the bus, the people sitting around him are all dull, tired, and quiet. No one pays attention to him. People seem to be normal: one is reading the newspaper, another with business suits sits quietly, and the other gazes absently towards the front. When Ed escapes from the bus, he runs into a residential district, pavement sides with tall apartment buildings and lawns. \n\nWhen Ed comes home, there are windows with shades in the living room. The house is a two-floor building. The twin\u2019s room is upstairs. There is a basement in the house. In the kitchen, a butcher knife lies in the drawer under the sink. On his way to Oak Grove, rough ground, gullies, open fields, and forest are along the way. \n\nIn Oak Grove, there is a gasoline station and drive-in. Several trucks park there\u2014some chickens on the field and a dog tied with the string. In front of the police station in Oak Grove, a telephone pole is suitable to hang a human body.\n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set in a small town named Pikeville. The town is described as very small, composed of a town center with a square. The town\u2019s town hall is where the aliens\u2019 portal was, so it was covered by a swarm of them. The town also has different streets and highways, which Ed needs to take in order to leave the town. He ended up crawling out of the town because he didn\u2019t want to be seen, and he ended up hurt and scratched because the town had a lot of shrubbery and plants. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story is first set in Pikeville, where Ed has spent the day digging dirt out of his basement and wheeling it into the backyard. His television store is also located in the town, where there are many other commuters. There is a little square of green in the center of the street that serves as the town park. The park also has a lonely drinking fountain, bench, and single lamppost. The dead body hangs from this lamppost. The town also has a Hall of Justice, City Hall, and police station. The Hall of Justice has barred windows and a police antenna. The City Hall, however, is an old-fashioned yellow structure of good, gilded brass, and cement steps. There are also buses that take commuters back home after the day. Loyce\u2019s home has a living room, upstairs, kitchen, and basement. Later, the scene changes to Oak Grove, where there are farm fields, stations, and even a police station. It is also home to the Oak Grove Merchants\u2019 Bank, where Clarence Mason spends the day working in the vaults.",
        "Summary_4": "The majority of the story happens in Pikeville. At five o\u2019clock, Ed drives from his house to his TV store across town. It\u2019s getting dark. He passes a small park where he notices the hanging body. Later, he is taken by two officers, and they are driving towards the City Hall. It\u2019s already gloomy outside - the sun has set. After escaping, he runs through a hardware store, climbs over a fence, and moves down a street alley. He can see the City Hall\u2019s roof. Then, he gets on a bus but soon runs away from the two suspicious passengers. He comes home and realizes that his family is under the influence of the alien flies. He crawls for ten miles, walks by a farm, and reaches a gasoline station, a couple of trucks parked near it. After that, he ends up at the police station of Oak Grove, the town near Pikeville. At the end, we meet another character who is leaving the Oak Grove Merchants\u2019 Bank."

No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain.

But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me.

So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook?

A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all.

Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency.

        "Summary_1": "The story is set on Mars. A group of conquerors from Earth arrived here after the last four crews never returned after deciding to climb a very high Martian mountain. The fifth team with Bruce, Marsha - his past love interest, Anhauser, Jacobs, Doran, Max Drexel, Stromberg - the psychologist, and its captain Terrence arrived here on their ship Mars V eight months ago. A day before the ascent Bruce is reading Byron and thinking about his bizarre dreams. Then we see an inquest. With all the crew members listening, Terrence interrogates Bruce and asks why he shot Doran. Bruce reminds the crew about the genocide of the Venusian aborigines: five years ago, he and Doran were part of the crew of the first ship that landed on Venus; these explorers wiped out the entire Venusian community. Terrence claims that Bruce is mentally ill and doesn\u2019t have the real conquering blood. The captain understands the young man doesn\u2019t believe in the philosophy of conquering and remains faithful to the old ideas of democracy and freedom. Bruce then explains that Marsha and Doran woke him up after a bizarre dream, and he immediately saw something or someone in the window. When Doran saw the creature, he left the room, and Bruce heard his rifle go off. Infuriated, Bruce killed the man. \n\nStromberg deems Bruce a delusional schizophrenic and says that Doran probably imagined the creature, too. Instead of punishing the man by executing him, Terrence orders Bruce to write down everything they report via radio while they are climbing. He stays by the radio, eats what they left for him, and sometimes sleeps. Eventually, Terrence reports that the mountain is way higher than they anticipated - 45 00 feet. Later, he screams that he just killed Anhauser for dissent. The captain speaks of their great conquest, and Bruce sometimes replies to prove he's still writing down everything. His dreams become more realistic and he seems to see some crew members of the previous expeditions: Pietro, Marlene, and Helene. Terrence reports that they are at an altitude of five hundred thousand feet and later adds that Marsha is dying. She says she loves Bruce, and he recites a poem for her. Terrence later crazily speaks about toppling the Solar system but soon stops reporting. Bruce turns off the radio. The exterior of the ship changes - now he sees a small town and the grandiose mountain vanished. Not sure if it\u2019s a dream or not, he approaches Helene, who eventually explains that the Martians wanted to stop the human conquerors. They decided to create an illusion of an infinitely high mountain, and the colonists felt an uncontrollable urge to climb it. They both walk to a red mound, where Bruce notices the bodies of the crew members of all five ships. Only people like him remained alive. Bruce looks at them and, together with Helene, leaves the mound, entering the city.",
        "Summary_2": "Bruce is reading some poetry he had sneaked upon the ship; he then dozes off but wakes himself to postpone one of his strangely realistic dreams. Jacob and Anhauser stand outside, surprised he did not run off somewhere. They have been on Mars for eight months, discovering other rockets that did not make it back. Everybody meets with Captain Terrence and Marsha Rennels, where they discuss Bruce killing Lieutenant Doran. Bruce tries to argue his way, but Terrence believes that he should never have been sent because of his bad mental state. Max Drexel considers him a crackpot idealist, but Bruce says that the first thing that the original travelers did to the Venusian village was destroy it completely. Bruce stops himself from arguing more because the New Era had only ushered final totalitarianism. Terrence asks him again why he shot Doran, and Bruce begins talking about the realistic dreams he has of the other crew members who never made it back to Earth. He continues to speak about the mountain, mentioning how everybody who has gone up has never come back down. Since their goal is not to conquer anything, Bruce feels no need to do it even if the destiny of Earth is absolute. When he is woken, he feels something looking at him; Doran also sees this too and grabs his rifle to go outside. Bruce is so overcome with rage about them killing aliens that he shoots him too. Stromberg, the psychologist, says that Bruce has schizophrenia, while Marsha also agrees that she did not see anything. Although the verdict should be execution for Bruce, they let him stay and take down radio reports when they go up the mountain. When the crew goes to climb, they begin documenting the experience for Bruce to list down. Bruce begins having more strange dreams, seeing a different martian landscape and meeting others. Terrence tells him that Marsha is dying, and he hears her call his name while telling him how much she loves him. Terrence continues his crazy yelling, and Bruce switches off the radio to see Helene smoking a cigarette. She explains how the Martians are masters of the mind and that the only people who survive are the ones who do not climb the mountain. The mountain is not real at all, as it is a product of the Martian\u2019s psychic powers. They go to check on the corpses after, and Helene asks if he loved Marsha. He responds that he had once, but it is too late now. As they walk towards the calm city, he asks if the crew is still climbing somewhere. Helene responds that not even the Martians know about that.

        "Summary_3": "This story follows Bruce and his fellow cremates of the ship Mars V, as they explore Mars for potential life. Bruce is sat in front of his crew members, with Captain Terrence taking the lead, for an inquest. He has shot a fellow crew member, Lieutenant Doran, supposedly without provocation. He is set on trial for a mere formality - his fate of execution already decided - to determine his motivations behind the killing. Bruce proclaims that there are injustices aboard the crew. In particular, he disagrees with the crew and Earth's dogged desire to conquest, which Doran embodied wholeheartedly. \nBruce describes he saw a figure or a shadow out the window of their shelter that could've blurred between dream and reality. Doran had turned and saw it too, only to rush out and shoot at it, after which Bruce then killed him. It was then decided that because the rest of the crew were going to climb the mountain, instead of execution being Bruce's fate, he would remain back to record their notes over the radio. \n\nAs the crew went on their climb, Bruce sat back and drifted between sedative sleeping and dreams. The crew began to climb beyond the mountain's estimated peak of 45,000 feet. At 60,000 feet, Terrence reported that he killed Anhauser as he was dissenting, wanting to go back down the mountain. At 500,000 feet, Terrence comes back on the radio to report that Marsha is dying. Bruce and Marsha profess their love for each other as they reflect upon the past, before being interrupted by Terrence's proclamations of conquering the mountain and the universe. \n\nThroughout the story, Bruce has been having dreams of two girls and a man, set in a Mars landscape completely different to the one in reality. As Terrence's voice breaks off into undistinguishable yells, he looked out the shelter's window to find that the previously red and barren landscape had changed into the lush landscape of his dreams. He sees Helene - one of the girls - and she tells him what's been going on. It turns out that the Martians had purposefully imaged Mars to appear red and barren and set up the mountain as a test for the humans. They had found that humans had an undeterred desire for conquest that incorporated no values of morality or humane-ness. As a result, only those who didn't follow this blind conquest like Bruce, Helene, and the other girl and boy are rewarded by the true landscape of Mars which is plentiful, lush, and inhabitable. While listening to Helene, they reach the mountain. There lies the bodies of the previous crew members who climbed the mountain, including that of Marsha's. Respectfully carrying her body to place beside the canal, Helene asked if he loved her to which Bruce replied that he did once, and that she was young enough where her mind was influenced by the other's will to conquest.",
        "Summary_4": "The fifth rocket, Mars V, hits Mars, and its crewmembers see the four rockets lying under the shadow of the highest mountain they have ever seen. Bruce is reading poems while waiting for the trial. Jacob and Anhauser, Bruce\u2019s crewmates, are surprised that Bruce did not run away from the execution, which is the night before all the crew members, except for Bruce, start to climb the mountain. In the trial, Bruce tries to explain the injustice done on Venus five years ago, when he and Doran went on the same mission, witnessing the brutality of Earthmen\u2019s conquest of wiping out the Venusian village without communication. But he soon realizes that it is futile as Terrence, the captain, and other crewmembers insist on the importance of the conquered strength and the twisted democracy. Asked for the reason for killing Doram, Bruce explains his dream, which seems to indicate there are lives on Mars, to them. In the dream, Bruce describes how Doran runs out to shoot the shadowy things in the mist as the Earthmen always do based on the philosophy of conquest. Bruce killed Doran, wanting to kill all of his crew members, and they think he is a psycho. They finally decide to leave Bruce with food concentrates and the work of recording while they climb the mountain. They start to climb the mountain while Bruce reads poems, sleeps, and dreams of a magnificent place. Along with the climbing, Terrence keeps reporting his feeling of conquest and power. He also kills Anhauser because he refuses to keep climbing. Meanwhile, as Bruce stops using sedatives and continues dreaming, the boundary between dream and reality becomes blurred. Three people seem to come from the previous rockets in Bruce's dream. Scenes in a dream are warm and wonderful. Marsha dies along with the climbing after confessing to Bruce. Terrence dies. When Bruce switches off the radio, the scenery outside the window changes; it fuses with his dream. A woman comes to him, explaining that the dream is reality while the reality with the mountain is fake. Martians created the phenomenon of barren land and the mountain as they wanted to stop Earth\u2019s conquest of the universe. With the mountain, Earthmen with the will to conquer will climb the mountain and die, and Earthmen who do not climb the mountain will live on Mars. The people in the dream he saw are all the crewmember of previous rockets who refuse to climb the mountain. Therefore, Earthmen will stop their conquest of Mars. After knowing the truth and seeing the corpses of other crew members, Bruce moves Marsha\u2019s corpse along the canals and leaves with the woman."

We haven't run into\nany signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our\ndestiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce!

The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  By BRYCE WALTON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by BOB HAYES\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   First one up this tallest summit in the Solar\n    \n   System was a rotten egg ... a very rotten egg!\n   \n \n \n \n  Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to\nopen the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n  \n \n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "At the beginning, Jacobs, Bruce, and Anhauser talk aboard their ship Mars V which recently landed on the windy surface of Mars. Bruce then looks at the even Martian landscape with an incredible mountain right near the ship and the double moons illuminating the surface. When everybody else leaves to climb the mountain, he spends his time on the spaceship, eating, sleeping, and sitting by the radio. Bruce dreams of a green valley and canals inside a town. And later, when the crew stops reporting anything, he finally can see the real landscape of Mars. He looks at numerous low hills with purple mist, a canal, and valleys with green trees. The mountain disappeared. A quarter of a mile beyond the canal, there is an ugly red mound with the bodies of the conquerors lying there. After looking at Marsha and Terrence, together with Helene, he walks along the canal back to the city.  \n",
        "Summary_2": "The story is set on Mars; it is originally shown as a dead planet with nothing but smooth, red hills caused by erosion. However, there is a mountain too that is around 45,000 feet. Mars also has double moons and is extremely cold. On Mars, there are also five ships from the Conquerors in their attempts to try and take total control of Mars. When Bruce has his dreams, the martian landscape changes to one of green valleys and rivers. There are wide canals, odd trees trailing their branches on the gliding rivers. There is also a pastel\u2013colored city that seems completely different from the Mars that the crew arrived to conquer. Later, it is revealed that this landscape is actually real because the fake Mars was just an illusion that the Martians set up using their powers to mess with the mind. The mountain does not exist either, having served its purpose of eliminating each group of Conquerors. ",
        "Summary_3": "This story is set on Mars. However, the Mars that the Conquerers see and the real Mars is different. \n\nThe Mars that the crew initially see lifeless, barren and has a flat landscape with only a mountain estimated at 45,000 feet standing out. There are four rockets - prior attempts at conquering Mars - lay side by side the mountain. \n\nThe real Mars that is revealed to Bruce is vastly different. It had lush green valleys and rivers and wide canals with slow currents. There were inhabited cities that are pastel-colored and overall, the atmosphere was soft, vibrant and lovely. Beyond the canal, the red mountain still stands. By the red mountain, the remains of the bodies of the crew of the first four ships lie as skeletons. The dead bodies of Bruce's crewmates also lie there - all still tied together by the rope.  ",
        "Summary_4": "The story happens on Mars. There are two moons on Mars. There is a tremendously high mountain where the top seems nowhere to be seen, and the four rockets sent before the fifth rock lie in its shadow. The landscape on Mars is smoothed with red eroded hills, except for the mountain, which is unexpected in height and points toward Earth. In Bruce\u2019s dream, which turns out to be the real Mars, the landscape on Mars is totally different. There are green valleys, wide canals, trees, and cities decorated with flowers. Behind the shelter, five rockets lie beside it. There is no mountain in the dream, only a high mound of the red hill with corpses lying on it."

Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain.

As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When\nthey came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains,\nactually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on\nwalking.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that\nthere is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it,\neither, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is\ngiven an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the\nConquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had\nto.\"\n  \n \n  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded\nhills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied\ntogether with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond\nthem were those from\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , too freshly dead to have decayed\nmuch ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and\nMarsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve\nmiles from the ship\u2014horizontally.\n  \n \n  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the\nfresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace\nbeside the canal.\n  \n \n  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd\nbeen older when they got her.\"\n  \n \n  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the\nleaves floating down it.\n  \n \n  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never\nseem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\nin the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n \n  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm\ncity. He didn't look back.\n  \n \n  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet\nI seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago.\nAre\u2014are the climbers still climbing\u2014somewhere, Helene?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the\nMartians have the answer to that.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the city.\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Bruce and Marsha were close years ago when they lived on Earth. They shared similar values and loved each other, but eventually, Marsha became one of the conquerors, ready to expand the human territories. Now she\u2019s almost emotionless. Bruce is disappointed and reckons that the other conquerors had gotten her young, and there was nothing he could do about it. When he\u2019s interrogated, the psychologist asks if she saw any creature before Bruce shot Doran. She seems hesitant and doesn\u2019t look at Bruce when denying seeing anything. When she is dying, she crazily laughs and admits that she is in love with him, asking Bruce to read her a poem. At the end, he finds Marsha\u2019s body among the eroded hills and puts it beside the city canal. He says that he loved her once, and she could\u2019ve been sane, different if the conquerors hadn\u2019t got her when she was so young. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Bruce and Marsha do not interact much initially. Marsha is a witness of when Bruce shot Doran, but she makes no move to oppose the other members of the crew. She also hesitates to meet his eyes when she speaks, only following orders. Bruce mentions that they had gotten her when she was too young. Later, when Marsha is dying, she calls him darling and mentions how much she loves him. Even though she is hysterical, Bruce remembers the time when they used to talk about human values. He recites poetry to her and tries to think about the good times on Earth. Later, it is revealed that Bruce loved her before on Earth. However, it eventually meant nothing because she had been converted by the Conquerors too early and could not fight back. ",
        "Summary_3": "Bruce and Marsha appear to once have been romantic partners, with both proclaiming their love for each other. They used to share poetry and talk about human values and had a clear and affectionate connection back on Earth.  \n\nHowever, Marsha and Bruce begin to distance as Marsha bought into the will to conquer, whereas Bruce leaned further away from this thought. This dissonance is apparent as she refuses to look at him during his inquest and at the fact that Marsha goes onto the climb. \n\nDespite this, when Marsha dies over the radio, they share a last moment of spoken affection. When Bruce sees her dead body, he takes care to rest her by the canal as he expresses his melancholy  over \"they\" getting to her young. ",
        "Summary_4": "Bruce and Marsha used to be lovers years ago. Marsha is indifferent to Bruce when Bruce accepts his inquisition from other crewmembers for his murder. When Marsha is asked whether she saw anything when Bruce killed Doran, she says no, even though she might see it. According to Bruce, Marsha was reconditioned to accept the new values in New Era, where strength and conquest are prioritized as the most important thing, compared to Old Era, where mercy and compassion seem to exist. Marsha keeps calling Bruce\u2019s name on the edge of death while climbing the mountain. She misses the warmth she used to have with Bruce, realizing that conquest is not everything. After she dies, Bruce places her corpse along the canals. Bruce and Marsha used to be in a romantic relationship, but after Marsha accepts the will to conquer, they become distant from each other. When Marsha is dying, Marsha finally regains herself and confesses to Bruce. Their relationship becomes tolerant and beloved."

Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n<doc-sep>Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip.\nLimping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings\nthey looked out on a strange and isolated world.\n  \n \n  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount\nTamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy\nwhite sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons\non a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding,\ntallest of the peaks and most forbidding.\n  \n \n  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold\u2014of all the kinds of\ngold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small\nportion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed\nto have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its\ncolor.\n  \n \n  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no\ninterest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes,\nRoddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.\n  \n \n  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which\nInvaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins\nof the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable\nover the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was\nthe advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on\nthe water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need\nto kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.\n  \n \n  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.\n  \n \n  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her\nface with scratched and bloodied hands.\n  \n \n  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and,\nweeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends.\nIda's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.\n  \n \n  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will\ncome back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so\nsenseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your\nfriends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men\u2014and the\ncity is ours, not theirs!\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   can't\n   \n  be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those\nwho are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to\nme. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be\naimless. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and\nend it by destroying it.\n   \n   My\n   \n  people must be the true Men, because\nthey're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to\nlet you escape.\"\n  \n \n  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.\n  \n \n  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in\ncold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two?\nDon't\u2014don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"\n  \n \n  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet\nsomehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said\nnothing.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and\nkill\u2014see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the\ncity regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack\nfriends, too! Men can accomplish anything!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The mountain is a sign of an impossible obstacle that the conquerors from Earth want to overcome, topple. Their urge to expand their territories and own the entire Solar System forces the Martians to come up with an illusion of something that can stop the destruction humans are spreading. The Martian mountain is a part of the hypnotic vision the conquered had access to, but they never saw the Martian city. They all ultimately died trying to climb it, from their drive to conquer everything they could find. The mountain is a perfect symbol of humans\u2019 greed for territories and power, and it is also what stops them all from expanding their so-called empire. ",
        "Summary_2": "The mountain is significant because it is the ultimate challenge that the Martians laid out for the humans. Since they are aware of the Conquerors and horrors on Venus, the mountain is an illusion that was made to stop the humans and let only the good ones live. Helene explains that the people on Earth will get the opportunity to live on Mars too, but the terrible ones must be destroyed so that civilization can be preserved on Mars. Even though everybody wants to scale the mountain in hopes of finding some sort of new discovery or territory for the totalitarian Earth, the mountain serves as a trap that kills all of the ones who try to conquer it. The mountain is what also hides the Martian world away, only fading away when there is only one sane human from each crew left. ",
        "Summary_3": "The mountain, placed there intentionally by the Martians, acted as a test for the Conquerers. Most of the people coming from Earth had a will to conquer, and the Mountain served as a physical manifestation of this desire. It becomes evident throughout the climb that the Mountain continuously rises above the initial estimate, and yet humans overtaken by their desire to conquer this will continue to stride on. By doing so, they have failed the test. \n\nIt is significant because it demonstrates the supposedly innate and greedy determination of humans to be the Conquerer and be at the top - figuratively and literally. Even when a task seems improbable, a human's ego will feed this determination. This will to conquer that is fuelled without reason or morality. And it's only through this test that the Martians are able to identify which humans do not have this senseless will, that they are rewarded with the supposed oasis that the Conquers themselves desired to take over. ",
        "Summary_4": "The mountain symbolizes a challenge to be conquered. It plays a significant role in the story as every Earthmen coming from Earth with the will of conquest would climb the mountain. The mountain is very high that Earthmen can see it from the space and that Earthmen with the will of domination would want to climb to the top, which they will never succeed. Everyone who climbs the mountain will eventually die as it is a hypnotic-like phenomenon, which cannot be described in human language, created by Martians. Martians make this mountain because they know that Earthmen with the will of conquest cannot bear not to climb it since they enjoy the feeling of belittling others and the power of conquering, which is shown through their actions of killing anything or anyone in their ways even though those killed species may not have any intention to harm them. The story also plays a crucial role in distinguishing between people with the will to conquest and people who has no desire to conquer. Those who have no will to dominate will not climb the mountain, and they will be sent to the reality of Mars, where everything is adorable and peaceful. In the story, only four people out of five flights can get to the Martian reality, which again shows the significance of the mountain. Using the mountain phenomenon, Martian will be able to stop the Earthmen\u2019s interplanetary conquest that Mars will be the furthest they can reach as they will keep climbing the mountain until they die."

        "Article": "Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep>Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and\nwhen he shot the\u2014\" Bruce hesitated.\n  \n \n  \"What? When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the\nmike. He got through to her.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n  \n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n  \n \n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into\nany signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our\ndestiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a\nthousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this\nworld\u2014the top of\n   \n   everything\n   \n  . The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Terrence is the ship\u2019s captain. At the beginning, he serves as a judge when he interrogates Bruce, who killed the other crew member Doran. Terrence listens to the story about Venus and claims that Bruce is not a true conqueror and is simply a psycho. He then asks a question about Bruce\u2019s dreams and later hears the story of Doran's death. Stromberg then concludes that Bruce has schizophrenia caused by inner conflict. He also supposes that Doran imagined the strange creature after Terrence asks him to explain the actions of the killed crew member. Finally, instead of killing Bruce, Terrence orders him to sit by the radio and write down everything they report while climbing. He reports that they are at fifteen and then twenty-five thousand feet and are to take a little time out. At forty thousand feet, he tells Bruce that the mountain is way higher than they thought - their computations are wrong. At sixty thousand feet, he shoots Anhauser after the latter starts dissenting and becomes hysterical and claims the mountain to be a tester for the real conquerors. Eventually, they reach the mark of five hundred thousand feet, and the captain is shocked. Later, Marsha unexpectedly starts dying, and Terrence concludes that women don\u2019t have real guts for such undertakings. At six hundred thousand feet, he starts declaring that they will soon find the top of the universe. Terrence made it farther than any other crew member of the five ships. He dies with his fingers still clutching the rock outcroppings. In reality, he\u2019s just over twelve miles away from the spaceship horizontally. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Terrence is initially present for Bruce\u2019s trial. He does not understand how the other man thinks, believing that nothing is more important than the destiny of Earth. He is a great believer of the totalitarian thought, finding no problem killing whatever stands in their way of ultimate conquest. He decides to scale the mountain with the other members of the crew, leaving Bruce behind to take care of the radio. On the mountain, Terrence excitedly documents his journey, talking about how far they have gotten. However, he does have to shoot Anhauser because the other man does not want to climb anymore. He shouts a few more reports to Bruce before disappearing completely, having died. Terrence is the one who tries to climb the furthest after everybody else dies, wanting to be the one who conquers the mountain and brings the glory back to Earth. In reality, he had completely been trapped in the illusion and lays dead at the end with his arms stretched out.",
        "Summary_3": "In the beginning of the story, Terrence leads the inquisition against Bruce for killing Lieutenant Doran without provocation. He has already determined Bruce's fate - an execution - but grants the inquest to understand his motivations. He often explodes in anger as Bruce only appears to give philosophical lectures about morality. When Terrence agrees to hear Bruce's supposed dreams out, he disagrees with Bruce's disinterest in climbing the mountain and concludes him to be a psycho. However, he agrees to let Bruce live only to note down the crew's upcoming climb to the mountain, for records. \n\nIn the latter half of the story, Terrence and his crew begin the climb up the mountain. Terrence often gives Bruce updates on the altitude of their climb, and sometimes request his response to make sure he is still there. Terrence also reported he had to shoot Anhauser for dissenting, as the latter wanted to descend back down the mountain. Upwards of an ascent of five hundred thousand feet, Terrence begins to go mad as he yells of his domination of the mountain and conquest of the Solar System. As his crazy yells fade, he is presumed to be dead, which is confirmed later on. ",
        "Summary_4": "Terrence wears a black uniform, and he is the captain of Mars V, a rocket that lands on Mars. Terrence presides over Bruce\u2019s trial that Bruce kills Lieutenant Doran. When they argue with each other, Terrence insists on the importance of the twisted democracy and the strength of a conqueror, which, according to Bruce, is totalitarianism disguised under democracy. Terrence regards Bruce as a psycho, deciding his fate of staying while he and all the other crewmembers climb the mountain. When they start to climb the mountain, Terrence reports to Bruce through the radio while climbing, showing his conquering feeling of climbing the highest mountain and belittling everything else, even the universe. Terrence kills Anhauser because he dissents to keep climbing. Terrence becomes more and more enthusiastic about climbing and conquering the mountain. When Marsha is talking to Bruce, Terrence interrupts them, expresses his ambition, and dies. He manages to climb to the highest but still dies."

        "Article": " \n  Brightside\n   \n  Crossing\n  \n by Alan E. Nourse\n  \n  JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had\na visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He\nhad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\nwere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\nhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousand\npardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave no\nname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back by\neight.\u201d\n  \n \n  Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\nabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\nRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\nnumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\nvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\nnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\nthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\nreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\nwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\nwithout justifying it.\n  \n \n  Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\ndown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face held\nno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014but\nhe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\nforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\nhealing.\n  \n \n  The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re\nplanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d\n  \n \n  Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can read\ntelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct.

When else?\u201d\n  \n \n  The grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a moment\nwithout expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re\nnot going to make the Crossing.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.\n  \n \n  \u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.\n  \n \n  There was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?\n   \n   Peter\n   \n  Claney?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n  \n \n  Baron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger\ngone. \u201cGreat balls of fire, man\u2014\n   \n   where have you been hiding?\n   \n  We\u2019ve been trying to contact you for months!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI know.

Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you\nmiscalculate? What were the trouble spots?\u201d Baron jabbed a\nfinger at Claney\u2019s face. \u201cThat, for instance\u2014epithelioma?\nWhy? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We\u2019ve\ngot to know those things.

By 2349, it was fog again.\n  \n \n  But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it.\nSomewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning.\n  \n \n  He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on the\ncracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks;\nwhat remained of the gutted concrete office building from which he\npeered was fire-proof.\n  \n \n  But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders broke\nin from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while\nthe soldiers went out to fight.\n  \n \n  And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be.

They traverse together to the Golden Gate Bridge, where Ida tells him that the invaders are in fact humans like them that go into the city in order to get food and supplies. Roddie doesn\u2019t want to believe that he is like an invader, so he chases Ida to the top of the bridge in order to kill her. Here, they confront each other and Roddie was very close to killing her, but decides not to. At the end, it is insinuated that Roddie learns that he belongs with the humans at the other side of the bridge and not with the robots.",
        "Summary_4": "It\u2019s the twenty-fourth century. San Francisco is ruined and now guarded by robot soldiers built by humans in the past. They fight with humans - Invaders - and don\u2019t let them come to the city. Roddie lives with Molly - a robotic nurse who still treats him as a child - and hasn\u2019t seen an invader. He sits with Molly and complains about not being allowed to fight alongside the soldiers. She starts singing a children\u2019s song, and Roddie rips her head off her neck. Soldiers come back. Roddie tries to fix one of them, but the robot unexpectedly attacks the young man. Molly defends Roddie by thrusting needles into the robot\u2019s eyes. Roddie is working and thinking about his desire to be accepted by the soldiers. His hair catches fire accidentally, and a Civil Defense firefighter covers him with carbon dioxide foam. Roddie gets frustrated and leaves. He is walking along cold streets and stone ruins toward his hideout. Roddie comes down to his manhole and realizes that someone was there. He starts moving in the darkness and soon finds Ida, a young human girl. Roddie understands that she thinks he is one of her kind and continues talking to her. She came on some boat and followed Roddie\u2019s footprints to his hideout. Ida says she knows a way over the Golden Gate Bridge and invites Roddie to go with her. They leave the hole, and Ida starts laughing at the diapers he\u2019s wearing. While walking, Ida tells him that men  rely on raids for tools and that she left here to help the wounded. Suddenly they meet one of the soldiers, Roddie quickly tells him everything is fine, and the robot leaves. Ida kisses him after the shock. They go to a supermarket to get food, and Ida asks why the robot let them go. Roddie shows her his watch - a talisman, and she looks scared. They reach the bridge. Ida starts leading him somewhere unknown, saying that she\u2019s taking him where he belongs. He refuses and starts chasing her with a hummer. While following her, Roddie starts walking along the suspension cable\u2019s steel surface; soon, walking turns into crawling. He thinks about killing Ida - it will earn him a place among the robot soldiers. They keep going up, finally reach a tower, and fall asleep for several hours. They wake up, and Roddie decides to look around the tower. He can see Mount Tamalpais, the Twin Peaks, and Mount Diablo. He follows Ida\u2019s gaze and finds the secret path the invaders are using. Roddie prepares to kill Ida, but she starts crying - it disturbs him. She tells him that he is a man, not a robot. Roddie says he believes the true men are rational and superior - thus, the robot soldiers are the real men. She asks him why killing a defenseless girl is rational and says that emotion is for creating. Roddie tucks his hammer away and comforts crying Ida.\n\n\n"

        "Query": "What are the characteristics of Ida, the human girl in the story \"Bridge Crossing\" who is determined to help the wounded and shows bravery and loyalty even when faced with danger?",
        "Article": "When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's\nassertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if\nshe felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of\nwhat the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an\nInvader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.\n  \n \n  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do\nany good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most\ndirect route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and\nshe began to talk.\n  \n \n  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless\nto him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had\nbeen.\n  \n \n  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many\ncasualties....\n  \n \n  \"But why do you\u2014we\u2014keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the\nsoldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and\nthey\n   \n   can't\n   \n  leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll\nbe plenty of young men.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever\ntell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep\nus out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our\ntools and things?\"\n  \n \n  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance.\nBut she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too\nclose for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder\nevery few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.\n  \n \n  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are\n   \n   you\n   \n  here? I mean, sure, the\nothers are after tools and things, but what's\n   \n   your\n   \n  purpose?\"\n  \n \n  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said,\n\"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no\nweapon.\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of\nwords. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored\nand hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the\nboats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was\nbeing silly?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"\n  \n \n  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and\nconcrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over\nthe water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they\ncould see the beginning of the bridge approach.\n  \n \n  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and\nclung to Roddie's arm.\n  \n \n  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"\n  \n \n  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back\nbelow the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a\nsoldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.\n  \n \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.\n  \n \n  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned\nand walked away.\n  \n \n  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie\nturned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to\nhis. He grimaced and turned away his head.\n  \n \n  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from\nhis arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've\nhad no sleep, no food or water.\"\n  \n \n  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to\ndeny his own humiliating needs.\n  \n \n  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care\nof you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"\n  \n \n  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he\nhad previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting\na pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had\ngrubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose.\nPicking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed\nan end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained\nspinach or squash.\n  \n \n  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat\nbaby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you\nhappen to know where to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging.\n\"I've been here before.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"\n  \n \n  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She\nwas silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can\nwith rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the\nrubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her\nstrength.\n  \n \n  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed\nplainly that he'd given himself away.\n  \n \n  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the\nsupposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as\nIda herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would\nsatisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he\nmight join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this\nenemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect\nhim.\n  \n \n  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of\nhis watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder\nat every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for\nthis self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention.\n  \n<doc-sep>She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her\nand looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced\nby the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in\nsight.\n  \n \n  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier\nhad ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left\nthe city, were not built to do so. But\n   \n   he\n   \n  was here; with luck, he\ncould capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.\n  \n \n  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"\n  \n \n  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened\nwire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.\n  \n \n  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted.\nNever had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar\nnon-mechanical construction.\n  \n \n  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling\nas that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling\nbody of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.\n  \n \n  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog\nthinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last\nhundred feet to sanctuary.\n  \n \n  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within\nthe tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and\nslept for several hours.\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean.

        "Summary_1": "Ida is a human girl that Roddie first encounters when she is hiding in the manhole that he frequents himself. She appears to have come into the android-ridden city on her own with the altruistic desire to help the wounded. She is selfless and persistent in her mission. She is inexperienced with the android world as demonstrated by her fright when the pair encountered a soldier, who only walked away after Roddie confronted it. Similarly, Roddie had to guide her around the city and help her with access to resources like shelter and food. \n\nIda is loyal and brave as well. Despite Roddie threatening to kill her at the end of the story, Ida insists on the idea that they are both human and that Roddie\u2019s way of thinking was incorrect. In the end, she is able to discourage him from killing her and he ends up comforting her. \n\n",
        "Summary_2": "Ida is short and lean, wearing a doeskin dress. Her legs are slender, and her tiny bare feet wear nothing. Her face is tanned and ruddy, with a full mouth and dark eyes. She is friendly to Roddie when she guesses he is lost from the boat. Ida is brilliant as she figures out Roddie\u2019s identity after his interaction with an android and his familiarity with the surrounding areas and baby food. She is also brave as she suppresses her fear and manages her way to escape from Roddie after knowing his intention to catch her. She is dedicated as her purpose in ruins is to help her fellows in every way possible. Roddie sees her as purposeless and impulsive. She is weaker than Roddie. She is nervous and scared when they walk towards the bridge, being furtive and close behind Roddie. She is emotional, and she considers it a good thing because she is angry at Roddie\u2019s claim of the superiority of being rational.",
        "Summary_3": "Ida is a girl that traversed illegally into San Francisco in order to help men get supplies and fight the robots that patrolled the city. Women weren\u2019t allowed to go into the city, so she snuck into one of the boats in order to help the wounded men who were fighting. She is described as small and thin, but that allows her to be quick and agile. When Ida meets Roddie, she wants to bring him back to the humans so he can learn where he comes from, and that he doesn\u2019t belong with the robots. She is very brave, because she wasn\u2019t afraid of being killed by Roddie or the robots. ",
        "Summary_4": "Ida is a young girl, one of the Invaders living outside the city. The fact that she followed Roddie\u2019s footprints and found his hideout seems to indicate her intelligence. She is brave and compassionate - Ida was ready to secretly leave her safe community and come to the city to help the wounded. She is emotional: we see that when she unexpectedly kisses Roddie or when she starts crying at the end. Ida also has a strong sense of justice - she considers returning the city to men a necessity, she thinks San Francisco belongs to them. Ida also doesn\u2019t seem to like violence or destructive behavior - this is what she says to Roddie at the end. \n"

This girl\u2014whatever\n   \n   that\n   \n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n  \n \n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n   \n   I\n   \n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n  \n \n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n  \n \n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n  \n \n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n  \n \n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself....\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see\nme soon enough.\"\n  \n \n  But she'd see\n   \n   him\n   \n  , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n  \n \n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n  \n \n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n   \n   if\n   \n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n  \n \n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n  \n \n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along\nthe top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve\nsteepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.\n  \n \n  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when\nhe'd followed.\n  \n \n  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would\nadmit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at\nevery downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only\nhis holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The first tool that Roddie uses is a screwdriver with a broken handle. He uses it to tinker with and screw Molly\u2019s head back onto her robot body, after tearing it off himself. He also used it when he was considering heating it over a fire to mold it into a different tool, but ended up not completing it. \n\nHis hammer is his weapon. Roddie keeps his hammer on his body, which he was able to reach for conveniently when he initially found a warm body hiding in the manhole. All throughout this initial encounter with Ida, Roddie has his hammer close to him, either clutching it or holding it in his mouth while climbing the ladder. He also uses it as a tool to break open cans. Finally, at the end of the story, he is prepared to use the hammer to kill Ida - even going as far as raising it threateningly - before deciding not to. \n",

During his conversation with Ida, he holds the hammer in hand all the time so that he can attack at any time needed. He also uses the hammer to open the canned baby food that he finds in the ruined supermarket.

        "Summary_1": "Put simply, Roddie is Man and his friends in the story are androids. Despite growing up with them and having been brought up by Molly, Roddie is human. One clear difference is the fact that Roddie is able to tear off the limbs of his friends and repair it back together. For example, he tore off Molly\u2019s head when her \u201cspells\u201d became worse, and then later tinkered it back on her head. Another example of this difference is when Ida begins to cry at the end of the story, and Roddie internally expresses that the first time he wept was the first time he noted a difference between him and his android friends, who presumably cannot emote in the same way. Similarly, they do not know pain nor fatigue, so Roddie pretends he doesn\u2019t either. At the very end of the story, he finally accepts that he is Man. \n",

His yearning to sleep amid the danger makes him think that he was built by an apprentice when he still believes he is one of the androids. He learns from Ida, a girl he meets in his hiding place, that all the androids are heat-sensitive to locate them in the dark. He also realizes the similarities between Ida and him when Ida is supposed to be the Invader. After going through all the obstacles with Ida to cross the bridge and feeling his weakness on the cable, he realizes the differences between his friends and him again. Recalling his memory of weeping after seeing Ida weep when she tries to convince him that he is a man, not an android,  Roddie finally acknowledges himself as a man different from his friends.",
        "Summary_3": "Roddie always knew that he was different from the robots which he lived with. He didn\u2019t have the same build, or the same gears and cables as them. Roddie always wanted to prove that he was the same, and that he could help them fight. When he meets Ida, who is very similar to him, he starts to doubt where he belongs.

Roddie can feel pain, he can be hot and cold, exhausted, hungry, or sleepy. While growing up, Roddie knew that the robots surrounding him did not have the same experience. He cried when he realized that he was different. This emotion also made him unique. After meeting Ida, he slowly analyzes her behavioral traits and sees how similar they are.

Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body.

        "Summary_3": "Madge Carnap shows a book, The Dance of the Planets, which looks old and terrifies Celeste Wolver. Celeste\u2019s husband, Theodor, argues with Madge about the disappearance of Mars\u2019 two moons, Phobos and Deimos. Madge believes the book author\u2019s prediction, Dr. Kometevsky, that the Earth will take a leap in space, but Theodor and Celeste don\u2019t believe her. They separate from each other, Madge goes to a meeting in a Buddist temple, and Theodor and Celeste go to a sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes to investigate the materials about the phenomenon. Theodor and Celeste talk about the possible omen and their family situation on their way. Theodor also mentions that many people with Extra-Sensory Perception have been dreaming similarly. \n\nWhen Celeste and Theodor go into the committee room, Edmund, one of the husbands, suggests the family to start examining the microfilms without waiting for Ivan, the third husband of the family. Rosalind goes out to check for Ivan. Other people take the projectors out of their suitcases and check the microfilms while Celeste turns on the TV. They start to focus on the audio, which talks about the discovery of the debris of the moons in their original positions and Dr. Kometevsky\u2019s call. When Rosalind returns with Ivan\u2019s suitcase, she doesn\u2019t hear the news that Jupiter\u2019s fourteen moons have become invisible on the TV. They examine the briefcase, finding it eerily muddy with two letters. When they take a break from the examination, Theodor and Rosalind go out to drink. Rosalind is dragged underground to the core of Earth while trying to catch up with Theodor. Meanwhile, Theodor meets Colonel Fortescue in the Deep Space Bar, who tells him that God is a military strategist and the whole phenomenon is the war between the forces of good and evil when listening to the news about the movements of Jupiter\u2019s moons and the unknown bodies in the space. Celeste watches Dotty in sleep. Edmund gathers everyone and starts to explain his discovery from all materials, including the metallic durashpere found in the center of Earth underground, the relation between the moons\u2019 debris and the durashpere of them, Ivan\u2019s and Rosalind\u2019s disappearances, and the godlike creatures in ESPs dreams. After his explanation, the godlike creature communicates with them through Dotty\u2019s body, explaining that Earth is their battleship, and that humans are their camouflage to escape from the pursuers. The pursuers have detected them, so Earth must be destroyed to let them grab the chance to flee. Only a small portion of humans will be saved to serve as the seed of the human race, such as Ivan and Rosalind. While the Wolver family is shocked by the truth, the godlike creatures negotiate with their pursuers. After a while, the godlike creature tells them that they are safe and will be brought to their place as the pursuers have changed to be good. In the end, Rosalind and Ivan are sent to the house, and the family gathers together.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Celeste Wolver is listening to her friend Madge Carnap hold a book called The Dance of Planets from the Twentieth Century. Her husband Theordor tries to argue that Kometevsky predicted the reshuffling of planets in a vague way, but Maggie Madge that it is undeniable Phobos and Deimos have disappeared. The story cuts to Celeste staring at a landscape, as Madge comes up to talk to her more about Dr. Kometevsky. Theodor says that the Mars Base would have noticed something, but Madge says that they are smaller than asteroids. Once she leaves, Celeste talks about how this feels like a warning for disaster in terms of complete security. She does not feel at rest because she has three husbands, and Theodor says that they are still family. Theodor talks about presenting evidence of dreams in ESPs at the meeting. The scene cuts to Dotty dreaming about being a God with god-like friends, and there are other gods out to stop them. Celeste and Theodor enter the committee room. Edmund is impatient to start without Ivan, but Rosalind says that she will go check on him. Celeste gets a newscast going, and everyone listens to the news about finding remnants of the two missing moons. There is also news about Kometevskyites staging helicopter processions to prepare for Earth\u2019s leap through space. Rosalind suddenly walks in and shows everybody the microfilms that Ivan has used to handle. Dotty dreams again that the other gods are combing the whole universe to find them. Edmund says that they have done everything they can with finding Ivan, and he offers to take over the notes about the Deep Shaft. Dotty once again dreams about the other gods fearing that the escaped ones have found a door going out of the Universe. As Rosalind and Theodor step out, Celeste goes to see Dotty. As Rosalind goes to investigate Ivan\u2019s briefcase, she notices that something is holding her feet ankle-deep in the path. Rosalind disappears too, as the bartender at the Deep Space Bar makes drinks for Theodor and Edmund. Colonel Fortescue believes that this is a war between good and evil. The scene then cuts to Celeste observing Dotty, as she says she is a god. Dotty asks if Celeste loves her, and she says that she does. Edmund calls everyone back together, piecing together the four clues to come to the conclusion that planets are a camouflaged fleet of gigantic spaceships. Dotty then comes, speaking with the voice of the god as it says that they will be escaping from the pursuers and destroying the planets because they have been found. As everybody contemplates what to do, the voice from Dotty suddenly says that their enemies have changed. They are no longer seeking to destroy them and that the planets are free because there is no need for them to be destroyed. Everybody feels much calmer, and Dotty says that she just had the funniest dream. "

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\n  \n \n  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\n  \n \n  Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n  \n \n  \"For what?\"\n  \n \n  \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n  \n \n  \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\n  \n \n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n  \n \n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n  \n \n  \"What about the book?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n   \n   kind\n   \n  of book?

For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\n  \n \n  The old man raised the gun.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "The incredibly old semi-god creatures escaped the tyranny of a communal mind to which no thoughts were private. These creatures believe in the principle of mental privacy, and that\u2019s why they escaped and planted seeds of life on planets, including the Earth, as part of their camouflage. Humanity exists as a result of these actions, and it also may shrink in numbers since the creatures have been found by their pursuers and are ready to leave again, thus destroying the planet. The belief in this principle also allowed the enemies of these creatures to rebel against the communal mind and welcome them back to the society of enlightened worlds and let humans live. ",
        "Summary_2": "Mental privacy is one of the reasons that the species was being hunted. It is said in the story that the species was hunted because they wanted to maintain a degree of mental privacy that the hunters didn\u2019t agree with. The species isn\u2019t willing to compromise with the hunters, as they firmly believe in their mental privacy. At the end it is revealed that the hunters have in fact separated from a hive mind that they had, and that they are now looking for their own mental privacy. Because of this reason, they want to welcome them back into their society without any violence. ",
        "Summary_3": "There are superior, godlike creatures living in the core of Earth. Earth and other planets are the superior creatures\u2019 battleships, and humans living on the Earth are their camouflage to escape from the search of their pursuers. The whole race of these superior creatures was under the tyranny of the communal mind that no private thoughts exist, which is why they escaped from it because they devoted themselves to the principle of mental privacy, which they believed is the greatest good in the Universe. Moreover, they have been hiding successfully under the camouflage of humans because the rule of the race is to never interfere with any life forms\u2019 developments, which makes the pursuers reluctant to examine Earth closely for not to interfere with humans living on it. In short, the principle of mental privacy is significant in the story as it is the leading cause for the superior creature to escape from their pursuers and plant life on Earth, their battleship. Therefore, the story cannot develop without the principle.",
        "Summary_4": "The principle of mental privacy is significant because it is what the group of godlike and telepathic beings have tried to maintain to the point of separating themselves from their race. It is also the reason why the beings must create great boats and ships to flee in, camouflaging themselves in order to throw off the enemy pursuers. Mental privacy is also important because it allows people\u2019s thoughts to remain their own without any other disturbances or possibly being forcefully shared. The godlike beings call it the greatest good in the universe because it is what they have stood for all their lives. It is also significant because without mental privacy, the godlike beings could control more things easily and become an even greater threat. "

No!\nPlease, no!\"\n  \n \n  Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at\nthe same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an\nagent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an\nexpression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She\ntouched the child's hand.\n  \n \n  Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come\nawake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in\na smile.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" she said sleepily. \"I've been having such funny dreams.\" Then,\nafter a pause, frowning, \"I really am a god, you know. It feels very\nqueer.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, dear?\" Celeste prompted uneasily. \"Shall I call Frieda?\"\n  \n \n  The smile left Dotty's lips. \"Why do you act so nervous around me?\" she\nasked. \"Don't you love me, Mummy?\"\n  \n \n  Celeste started at the word.

        "Summary_1": "Throughout the entire story, the narrative gets interrupted by small parts of Dotty's dreams. She has extrasensory abilities, and the semi-god creatures use her and other ESPs to communicate with people. In her dreams, she tells the story of these creatures' life. She speaks about their belief in mental privacy and says that other gods do not want them to have private thoughts and decide to hunt them down. The creatures that value privacy of thoughts create inhabited planets and manage to hide for millions of years from the others. But now they have been found and need to flee again. Dotty\u2019s dreams conceptually explain the origin of the planets of the Solar System and why those need to be destroyed now.

        "Summary_2": "Dotty is one of the humans with Extra-Sensory Perception, which allows her to be a gateway of communication between the species that live within Earth and humans. A side effect of this is that she dreams a lot from the perspective of the other species. Her dreams are a reflection of what the species is feeling and what they are thinking with respect to their hunters. Dotty could understand that the species was being hunted, and could understand what they were thinking. At the end, Dotty wakes up and tells the family that she was dreaming.",

The godlike creatures leave their fellows, who are scared by them because of the unknown of their secret thoughts. When they used all their ways to get out of the universe, they had no choice but to hide under the camouflage disguised with life, and they succeeded. Dotty\u2019s dream is significant because it shows how and why the godlike creatures fled from their point of view.

The dreams also reveal how the group managed to escape, creating great ships and camouflaging themselves so that their pursuers will not be able to catch up to them. Later, Dotty\u2019s dreams also allow her to be controlled by one of the voices so that she is able to tell the rest of the Wolvers what will happen to the world and them because the pursuers have discovered where the rogue god-like group has been hiding.

Celeste points out that the probability of Dotty being Theodor\u2019s daughter is only one-third. She reckons that humanity might have gone too far with some things, including monogamous marriages. While in the committee room, she tries to determine if they are a true family or just experimenting with their relationship. The family members seem both familiar and unfamiliar to her. When she wants to check up on Dotty, she thinks that she is no one to the girl but still goes on. Dotty, after a small chat, makes Celeste say that she loves her.

Throughout the story, these same feelings are reflected, as Celeste seems to be wary when taking care of Dotty. At the end those feelings seem to take a back seat, as they were more preoccupied with the threat of the other species. ",
        "Summary_3": "Celeste shares three husbands, Theodor, Edmund, and Ivan, with the other two women, Rosalind and Frieda. Celeste is uncomfortable with one of her husbands, Theodor, as she talks about her insecurity of facing the unknown catastrophe in the future and having three husbands when she cannot find security from a single whole man who only belongs to her. She also does not see herself as belonging to the family as she separates herself from being the mother of a child, Dotty, born from Frieda\u2019s womb. She feels uneasy and unsecured with the polygamous family as all her husbands share one-third of the chance to be the father or a husband of any child or wife in the family. She also feels distant from her family while knowing all their quirks and habits. When she goes to watch Dotty, she feels bitter and worried. When Dotty asks her whether she is her mother, Celeste smiles with uncertainty, questioning her feeling of separation from the family.

Although Celeste is quite casual when Theodor kisses the other two wives, she begins to think later whether or not they are actually family. She wonders if they are truly a united group or just a bunch of silly adolescents playing around with marriage. Later, she does begin to warm up to Dotty after the child asks if she loves her. She says that she loves Dotty, despite the earlier feelings, and even tries to call out to her later. Although Celeste does not explicitly admit it, she does begin to grow closer and secure with the other family members. "

        "Query": "What is the story BREAKDOWN about?",
        "Article": "Eight hours, three sandwiches and six beers later, Dan roused suddenly\nfrom a light doze and sat up on the cot. Between him and the crowded\nshelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air.\n  \n \n  The apparition was an open-work cage\u2014about the size and shape of an\nout-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures\nwere visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs.\nThey glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework.\n  \n \n  A faint sound cut into the stillness\u2014a descending whine. The cage\nmoved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped,\ncrackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage\nsettled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly\nswitches....\n  \n \n  The glow died.\n  \n \n  Dan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth\nwas dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it\nwas here\u2014\n  \n \n  Never mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had\nprepared for the occasion:\n  \n \n \n   Greeting, visitors from the Future....\n   \n \n \n  Hopelessly corny. What about:\n   \n   Welcome to the Twentieth Century....\n   \n \n \n  No good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to\nDan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now\nlooked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with\na cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves\nlooked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and\nbalding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed\nDan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the\ntable, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at\nthe stacked shelves.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,\" the shorter man said.\n\"Fathead's gonna be pleased.\"\n  \n \n  \"A very gratifying consignment,\" his companion said. \"However, we'd\nbest hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?\"\n  \n \n  \"Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, magnificent. Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.\"\n  \n \n  Manny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack.\n  \n \n  \"Like always,\" he grumbled. \"No nood dames. I like nood dames.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look at this, Manny! The textures alone\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Manny looked. \"Yeah, nice use of values,\" he conceded. \"But I still\nprefer nood dames, Fiorello.\"\n  \n \n  \"And this!\" Fiorello lifted the next painting. \"Look at that gay play\nof rich browns!\"\n  \n \n  \"I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,\" Manny said. \"They was\npopular with the sparrows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.\" Manny, turning to place a painting\nin the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting\nclattered to the floor. Dan stood, cleared his throat. \"Uh....\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh-oh,\" Manny said. \"A double-cross.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've\u2014ah\u2014been expecting you gentlemen,\" Dan said. \"I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,\"\nManny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow,\nFiorello.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't start nothing, Buster,\" Manny said cautiously. \"We're plenty\ntough guys when aroused.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to talk to you,\" Dan insisted. \"You see, these paintings\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake. Like, we figured this was the\ngent's room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Manny,\" Fiorello cut in. \"It appears there's been a leak.\"\n  \n \n  Dan shook his head. \"No leak. I simply deduced\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Look, Fiorello,\" Manny said. \"You chin if you want to; I'm doing a\nfast fade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't act hastily, Manny. You know where you'll end.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" Dan shouted. \"I'd like to make a deal with you\nfellows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah-hah!\" Kelly's voice blared from somewhere. \"I knew it! Slane, you\ncrook!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n",
        "Summary_1": "Harry Burr is begged by his wife Edna to go see a doctor because she believes that he is sick in the head. He refuses to believe that anything is wrong, but he does admit that there are times where he lies in fear over nothing and mixes up his memories. The story then jumps to the present, where he begins to think about a blond boy named Davie. Edna is confused because they have no children. Edna brings up seeing a doctor again, he angrily responds that it will only be Timkins who brought their son into the world. Edna tells him they had no son, and Timkins died a while ago. The scene cuts to breakfast, where Harry complains about a lack of meat. Edna explains that there is only multi-pro because of the current crisis in the country. Harry begins to go walk outside, but he experiences more strange memories that don\u2019t add up. He picks up the delivery that Edna ordered. Edna asks if there is anything good on television this week because there is only one channel. After a late lunch, Harry goes to check on the animals again and wonders what happened to the rest of the livestock. Edna tells him that they got the same as everyone else, and he goes upstairs again. When he awakes again, Gloria and Walt have arrived. He asks about Penny and Frances. After they leave, He takes his mare Plum out for a ride, and they arrive at a barbed wire fence area up north. He gets over the wire and continues to walk north, until the earth changes to sand. Then, the sand becomes wooden flooring; there is also a loud roaring sound. When he reaches a waist-high metal railing, he runs back to Plum again. Harry has the idea to ride to town, even if the other neighbors tell him to stop and for somebody to call the police. Soon, two policemen come out to escort him to the doctor. Harry asks the doctor where his son is, and the doctor explains that he is dead like so many millions of others. The doctor tells him he has so many things to do, and he says there are a few remaining people who are still alive. Harry\u2019s brain struggles with the impossible concept, and he thinks about how this is not Iowa. Just as Harry realizes what they are on, the switch is thrown, and he finds himself feeling better from the diathermy treatment. Before Harry leaves, the doctor tests him one last time by telling him that they are on an ark. Harry is confused, which means that the treatment works. He goes home to Edna and is happier than ever. ",
        "Summary_2": "This story follows Harry, a farmer living in Iowa. He and his wife, Edna, live in a time of crisis and so there are many government regulations to follow. Some of these regulations include food rationing, being restricting to farming vegetables, only being able to travel to the neighbors house, etc. While going about his day, Harry often has visions of a young boy named Davie, someone he understands to be his and Edna's son. He is also constantly discombobulated by the placement of things in the house as well as events that supposedly did or did not happen. This confusion leads Edna to be very worried about him, and she insists for him to visit Dr. Hamming, which he refuses. \n\nOne night, their neighbors Walt and Gloria visit. Harry mistakenly asks about their older daughter - who doesn't exist - and spends the rest of the dinner quiet. After the neighbors leave, Edna is furthermore distraught which prompts Harry to leave the house in hopes of clearing his mind. Outside, he creates a makeshift saddle over his horse, Plum, and rides off into the unplanted fields. After travelling for a while, he and Plum approach a fenced off property labelled \"Phineas Grotton Farm\". Trespassing nonetheless, he rides Plum forwards before pausing; he felt as if everything around him was wrong, including his supposed friend Pangborn putting up a massive fence. \n\nGoing over the fence, he noticed a roaring sound growing louder and the smell of the air changing. As he walked, the ground underneath him changed from earth to sand to wood. He came over to a metal railing and found that it overlooked an endless crashing water and salty air - the ocean. After a while, he rode Plum back to his farm, only to note that he had arrived without even needing to go through town. On the way back, he was spotted breaking travel regulations and was pulled over by the police, who take him to the doctor's office. \n\nAt the doctor's office, his confusion is finally explained away. While being prepped for treatment, Dr. Hamming reveals that his supposed son, Davie, and friend Pangborn, were indeed real and alive, but killed by the bombs. Only a few remain amongst the uninhabitable land, and so it was Dr. Hamming who brought them along to his inhabitable world. Dr. Hamming, his two sons, and his now late wife work together to wipe the bad memories from the townspeople and keep the community going as they, on board an ark, continually search for inhabitable land. As Harry begins to form his own conclusions, Dr. Hammings injects him with the treatment and his sane mind is restored. \n\nAt the end, Harry returns home to his wife. She expresses a worry that he may have taken Plum and broken regulations, to which he insists he would never do. ",
        "Summary_3": "Harry seems to have a memory problem. His wife, Edna, often begs him to see the doctor in the town, but he refuses. He often remembers memories that are mismatched with reality. For example, he thinks he has a son, Davie, but all the people, including Edna, deny the fact. He remembers that his fields were planted fully with crops such as wheat and corn, not wasting the land, but now he can only plant a patch of vegetables with all the other fields remaining fallow. He thinks Timkins, the doctor he used to go for, is still alive, but Timkins died a long while ago, based on Edna\u2019s testimony. After eating the rationed food supplied by the government for breakfast, he checks his barn and farms around his house, which seem unfamiliar to him compared to his memory. He picks up the delivery of living supplies and sees the listed movies provided, having the same conversation with Edna as last week. The more he sees, the more he realizes that everything is wrong. When their neighbors visit them and eat with them, Harry has more mistakes in his memory and does not talk while eating. When Edna begs him to see the doctor again, he goes out to ride a mare called Plum.\n\nAt night, Harry rides Plum towards the north on the empty road. Soon after realizing he may be reported for breaking travel regulations, he cuts into an unplanted field. He faces a fenced farm where the owner\u2019s name is unfamiliar with what he remembered to be; he opens it and keeps going northwards. When he reaches the end, he sees a tall metal mesh with barbed wire fence with no gates and climbs to the other side of the fence, seeing nothing but the ocean while standing on the wooden floor. He goes back to the fence, climbs it, and mounts Plum. He tries to find the town but fails. He rides on the road, passing his and his neighbor's houses. People living next to the road shout at him for breaking the regulation, but Harry gives no care to those unfamiliar faces and goes to the southern tip, seeing the extension of the metal fence, climbing through it, and the ocean is there again. When he returns to the fence, two men in police uniforms from a car catch him. He gets in the car, letting one man lead his horse back to his house. They arrive at the doctor\u2019s house, where Harry is told by Doctor Hamming the truth that the people on the ark are the remaining humans in the world. All the other humans might have already died from the bombs, including his son Davie. Harry has those memory problems because his real memory is coming. As soon as Harry realizes what is going on, he forgets it again as the treatment is already applied to him. After the treatment, he returns home and chats with his wife carefreely.\n",
        "Summary_4": "Harry has mixed memories and forgets facts from his life. He wakes up in the morning, asking his wife about their son Davie but momentarily remembers that they have no children. He then suggests that he cooks bacon for breakfast but once again recalls that there is a meat ration. His wife Edna asks him to see Dr.Hamming, but Harry is adamant. During breakfast, Harry complains about rations. Edna tells him they will have multi-pro meat for dinner - he is not satisfied. While doing the chores, Harry realizes his barn seems different and unfamiliar. After picking up the delivery, he says that the TV program guide has old moves, but Edna has never seen them. Harry decides to take a nap and feels that everything around him is wrong. After lunch, he goes back to the barn and sees that they have fewer chickens than he remembers. Their neighbors, Walt and Gloria, come over. Harry makes some strange comments about the neighbors' children - he keeps silent for the rest of the evening. Walt and Gloria leave, and Edna asks Harry to go to the doctor again. He leaves for a walk, harnesses his horse, Plum, and heads north towards the town. He soon reaches Phineas Grotton Farm, which he has never seen before. He goes through the gate and continues riding to the north. The countryside seems wrong to him. Soon, he stumbles upon a ten-foot-high fence with a slight inward curve. He ties Plum to the fence, climbs over it, and walks on. The earth beneath his feet turns into the sand and then into wood flooring. He finally sees a metallic railing covered in saltwater. He sees waves beyond the railing - an ocean - and nervously runs back to Plum. He disregards the traveling regulations and rides along the road in the opposite direction - the citizens scream that he is breaking the law. Soon, he reaches the same high fence, railing, and ocean. A police car pulls over: one officer takes Plum, and the other drives Harry to Doctor Hamming. When entering the house, Harry hears some rumbling sound. The doctor, the officers' father, asks about the second son and starts working on Harry, who keeps asking about Davie. The doctor reveals that Harry\u2019s son, just like millions of others, died during a bombing. The doctor claims that he, together with his two sons, is now running the world for the few hundred who survived after putting them on his world with the only uncontaminated soil left. He has to control the crops and livestock. He says he erased all the knowledge about these events to help people remain sane. Harry realizes Davie is dead, and he isn\u2019t in Iowa. The doctor turns off the radio switch, and Harry immediately forgets this. He thanks Hamming for the treatment. Harry hears the doctor say that they are on an ark, but he doesn\u2019t understand what it means and goes home in peace. \n\n\n"

        "Summary_1": "Doctor Hamming is first described by Edna as someone who can treat Harry\u2019s so-called \u201cmental problems\u201d. She insists for Harry to go see him multiple times, but Harry refuses every time. Finally, when Harry is escorted by the policemen does he go meet Doctor Hamming in person. In person, Doctor Hamming is a thin little man with a bald head and framed glasses. He also wears a white coat and looks about one hundred years old. He lives with his two sons, and his wife is not around anymore. His son\u2019s names are Pete and Stan. Doctor Hamming is a very stressed person, constantly trying to manage the ark. He is also impatient as well, raising his voice when Harry asks him about his dead son. However, although the doctor is impatient, he is very knowledgeable in his field as well. He predicted that people will begin to die from a disaster and invested a lot of his money to build the ark. He has exceptional planning skills, picking out the farmers in the rural areas as people to continue living on the ark because he knows how important the farmers are. The doctor\u2019s treatments are very successful as well, capable of completely erasing Harry Burr\u2019s conflicting memories and making him forget that they are on an ark. ",
        "Summary_2": "Dr. Hamming is the only doctor in the town, as the other Dr. Timkins had previously died. He is described to be a thin little man, bald, wearing frameless glasses and overall looking to be frail and at least a hundred years old. \n\nHe is weary and tired as he and his two sons are seemingly in charge of up-keeping the entire health, wealth and charade of the townspeople. He is compassionate as a doctor and has a deep passion for survival. He is generous, for he had saved a few of the remaining people alive after the bomb to try and find uncontaminated land to rebuild life on. \n\nHe describes himself as insane. Insane to be playing God, to be plagued with the memories of what actually happened, and to have been searching for habitable land for years on end. ",
        "Summary_3": "Doctor Hamming is the only doctor on the ark who is on the duty of maintaining the ark, finding the habitable land, and brainwashing the farmers on the ark. He lives in the new house two miles away from Dugan\u2019s farm. He is thin, bald, and little, wearing frameless glasses and a white coat. He looks very old. He has two sons, Petey and Stan. His wife lost her mind a long time ago before he had the technique to help her. He is stressed because of the enormous pressures of running a world by himself and his sons without much financial support. He is insane because he and his sons have been playing god to maintain good social conditions on the ark for three years, searching for habitable lands desperately, and surrounded by people who know nothing. He is careful as he makes sure everyone on the ark knows nothing about the truth but he and his sons only to prevent possible chaos and terror. He is thoughtful of his plan as he knows what humans need to survive on a single ark and organize things in a necessary order. After the explosion, he picks up the remaining alive farmers to sustain the human race. He is desperate as they cannot find any pure habitable land for years.",
        "Summary_4": "Doctor Hamming is a medical specialist and a scientist. He saves several hundred people by relocating them to his ark with uncontaminated soil. He is resilient and responsible because he managed to gather the survivors and build a self-sustaining community that lives after the bombing. The doctor is lonely: he tries to talk to Harry, the only sane person besides him and his two sons, while the man\u2019s memory is not under any influence. He is pragmatic and cautious - the doctor started building his ark before the Holocaust started. He was planning the construction, ready for the following catastrophe. He wants to live and to let people live - that's why he spent the last three years managing his mini-world and waiting for some land to become habitable again. "

        "Article": "Suddenly, he understood. And understanding brought not peace but the\ngreatest terror he'd ever known. He screamed, \"We're on....\" but the\nswitch was thrown and there was no more speech. For an hour.

What do you call these treatments?\"\n  \n \n  \"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered.\n  \n \n  Harry gave him a five-dollar bill.

And when had he sold his other livestock?\n  \n \n  Or had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease?\n  \n \n  He stood in the yard, a tall, husky man with pale brown hair and a face\nthat had once been long, lean and strong and was now only long and\nlean. He blinked gray eyes and tried hard to remember, then turned and\nwent to the house. Edna was soaking dishes in the sink, according to\nregulations\u2014one sinkful of dishwater a day. And one tub of bath water\ntwice a week.\n  \n \n  She was looking at him. He realized his anger and confusion must be\nshowing. He managed a smile. \"You remember how much we got for our\nlivestock, Edna?\"\n  \n \n  \"Same as everyone else,\" she said. \"Government agents paid flat rates.\"\n  \n \n  He remembered then, or thought he did. The headache was back. He went\nupstairs and slept again, but this time he had dreams, many of them,\nand all confused and all frightening. He was glad to get up. And he was\nglad to hear Walt and Gloria talking to Edna downstairs.\n  \n \n  He washed his face, combed his hair and went down. Walt and Gloria were\nsitting on the sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. Walt was saying he'd\ngotten the new TV picture tube he'd ordered. \"Found it in the supply\nbin this morning. Spent the whole day installing it according to the\nbook of directions.\"\n  \n \n  Harry said hi and they all said hi and he sat down and they talked\nabout TV and gardens and livestock. Then Harry said, \"How's Penny?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine,\" Gloria answered. \"I'm starting her on the kindergarten book\nnext week.\"\n  \n \n  \"She's five already?\" Harry asked.\n  \n \n  \"Almost six,\" Walt said. \"Emergency Education Regulations state that\nthe child should be five years nine months old before embarking on\nkindergarten book.\"\n  \n \n  \"And Frances?\" Harry asked. \"Your oldest? She must be starting\nhigh....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because\nhe couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing\nand rising. \"Let's eat.

Edna begged him to see the doctor living in that new house\ntwo miles past Dugan's farm, but he refused. He point-blank refused to\nadmit he was sick\n   \n   that\n   \n  way\u2014in the head!\n  \n \n  Of course, a man could grow forgetful. He had to admit there were\nmoments when he had all sorts of mixed-up memories and thoughts in his\nmind. And sometimes\u2014like right now, lying in bed beside Edna, watching\nthe first hint of light touch the windows\u2014he began sweating with fear.\nA horrible, gut-wrenching fear, all the more horrible because it was\nbased on nothing.\n  \n \n  The chicken-run came alive; the barn followed minutes later. There were\nchores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except\nthat now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only\na vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields\nremain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to\nwaste....\n  \n \n \n   Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing\nstronger each day from helping out after school.\n   \n \n \n  He turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\"\n  \n \n  She cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh? What happened to who?\"\n  \n \n  \"I said, what....\" But then it slipped away. Davie? No, that was part\nof a dream he'd had last week. He and Edna had no children.\n  \n \n  He felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it. Edna opened her\neyes as soon as his weight left the bed. \"Like hotcakes for breakfast?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eggs,\" he said. \"Bacon.\" And then, seeing her face change, he\nremembered. \"Course,\" he muttered. \"Can't have bacon.

        "Summary_1": "Harry and Edna Burr are married. Initially, Edna is very concerned about Harry because of the strange memories that he experiences. She tries to plead with him to see a doctor, but he refuses to believe it. Harry is seen getting impatient with Edna, mainly because she is confused about the questions or people that he talks about. Even though she is concerned, Edna is good at comforting Harry. When he complains about the lack of meat, she tells him that they will have some multi-pro for lunch. The two of them split their duties as well, with Edna doing a lot of the housework and Harry doing the more manual labor. She also tries to suggest activities to do, such as asking what\u2019s on the channel for this week. Edna loves Harry very much, but she does encourage him to seek a doctor to help his mental health. At the end, when Harry returns from his treatment, she asks if he has gone out to break any regulations. He only laughs and says he would rather kill a pig than do that. ",
        "Summary_2": "Harry and Edna are husband and wife who both live on their farm, next to their neighbours Walt and Gloria. Harry appears to be increasing confused and distorted in his memory of the places, people and things around. Because of this, Edna is worried about him and wishes for him to visit the doctor's office. Harry constantly refuses her request, for he is unwilling to admit anything is wrong with him and that he does not want to see an unfamiliar doctor. Supposedly the two of them have a son together named Davie. However, when Harry accidentally mentions him as a figment of his dream, Edna doesn't correct him that he passed or of his existence, and so Harry assumes from her that Davie was not real. \n\nWhen the neighbors come over for dinner, Harry slips up again and Edna begins to cry. He decides to go out for a walk and potentially sleep there like he had done as a kid as to not further worry her. \n\nAt the end of the story after his visit to his doctor, Edna is relieved. She expresses that she thought Harry may have gone off somewhere - but after gone to the doctors - Harry would never have dreamt to do such a thing. ",
        "Summary_3": "Harry and Edna are in a marital relationship. Harry is Edna\u2019s husband, and Edna is Harry\u2019s wife. Edna cares for Harry a lot. Whenever Harry behaves as if he forgets the reality and sinks into the seemingly fake memory, she always asks him to see the doctor even though he never accepts her advice. Harry gains a lot of information about the present from Edna as he cannot remembers a lot of things, or to say, his memory is mismatched with what Edna has told him. Harry cherishes Edna so much that he can\u2019t bear to see her cry. When Edna was crying, he would speak softly and kiss her.",
        "Summary_4": "Throughout the story, Edna becomes more and more upset because of Harry\u2019s strange behavior. At the beginning, after Harry mentions their non-existent son, meat, and their dead family doctor, she starts crying and asks him to see a doctor. He tells her he\u2019s still half-asleep. During breakfast, he gets irritated by how she calmly accepts the rations and the state limitations on food and travel. He makes several unordinary remarks during the day and makes seemingly strange comments about their neighbors' children. After their friends leave, she starts crying and asking Harry to see a doctor. Harry cannot stand her crying and goes for a walk. In the end, their relationship is supposed to get better since doctor Hamming improved his mental state."

A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation.

He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  By BRYCE WALTON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by BOB HAYES\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   First one up this tallest summit in the Solar\n    \n   System was a rotten egg ... a very rotten egg!\n   \n \n \n \n  Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to\nopen the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here.

        "Summary_1": "The story is set on an ark that Doctor Hamming put money into creating. Although it resembles Iowa, the residents are fooled to believe that it is indeed Iowa. Each of the residents have their own farm and land area, and they are restricted to only staying inside a certain area. For the Burrs, they cannot go beyond the Shanks\u2019 place. Harry\u2019s farm area has his house, an area for the livestock, and a tractor shed that was supposed to be torn off. Their area also has a supply bin that is shaped like an old-fashioned wood bin for deliveries from the government.  The land they live on is also shared with the Franklins. When Harry takes Plum out for a ride, they go up north past the Franklins to where the Bessers should be.  Then, they reach a small Pangborn farm.  Beyond Pangborn, there lies old Wallace Elverton\u2019s place, which is known as the biggest farm in the country. There is barbed wire in this area, and he walks past it. Slowly, the earth becomes sand and then wood. There are also colored folks living here, when there shouldn\u2019t have been, and a place called Piney Woods exists as well. The place where Doctor Hamming  lives is two miles past Dugan\u2019s farm. It resembles a hospital, but there is nobody else inside of it. ",
        "Summary_2": "This story is set in Iowa, perhaps a town, specifically, the farmhouse of Edna and Harry. This farmhouse had fields of land, a thriving vegetable patch, and a barn. Towards the road, there is a wooden supply in for deliveries and payment by the government. \n\nWhile on the horse, Harry encounters a farm fenced off with barbed wire. As he walked, the ground changed from beneath him. It went from earth to sand to wood. Here, he found a waist-high metal that when overlooked, revealed endless salty water - the ocean. \n\nAt the end of the story, Harry visits the doctor's place which is located in a new house past Dugan's farm. The house had long passageways and many. stairways, with gray walls and cold lighting. In there, there were windowless rooms. ",
        "Summary_3": "The story happens on a wooden ark floating on the ocean. The first scene is in Harry\u2019s two-floor house. There are bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom in his house. There is a blue armchair, a sofa, and a TV in the living room. Outside the house is the barn with the floor strewn with hay. Across the yard, there is a pigpen with four pigs inside. Behind the house, there is a half-acre truck farm. Across the front yard, there lies a wooden supply bin by the road. The road is empty, along which are unplanted fields. Ten-foot heavy steel mesh on top with three-foot barbed wire surrounds all the houses on the wooden ark. Near the edge of the ark, the floor is covered with hard-packed sand. On the edge of the ark is a metal railing circling the ark. The doctor\u2019s house is big. Inside the house, at the end of a central passage and dozens of doors on both sides, a stairway downwards to at least two hundred yards depth, where the end leads to a ramp going upward. The grey plaster walls, black floors, and white lighting set a dull tone. An engine for the ark to move lies in the most central and deepest part of the house.",
        "Summary_4": "Harry and Edna think that they live in Iowa\u2019s countryside. In the morning, they have a small conversation in the bedroom. Then Harry goes to the bathroom to wash, then to the kitchen. After eating, he spends some time in the barn and goes to the truck behind the house. Later, harry picks up a delivery in the front yard. He takes a nap and then eats in the kitchen. In the evening, their guests are seated on the sofa, and Edna is in the blue armchair. Later, Harry rides to the north. He trespasses on Phineas Grotton Farm. Then, he climbs over a high fence, and soon notices sand and later wood flooring beneath his feet. Finally, he sees the ocean. He runs back to his horse and decides to ride in the opposite direction along a residential road. He again reaches the railing and the ocean. The police officer gets him to doctor Hamming. This building is big: they go along the central passageway and see dozens of doors branched off it on both sides, and stairways go down from it in at least three places that Harry can see, and at the far end\u2014a good two hundred yards away\u2014a big ramp led upward. And it was all gray plaster walls, black floors, and cold white lighting, like a hospital, or a modern factory, or maybe a government building. He comes into a windowless room with a medical chair and a set of radios. At the end, after learning that he lives on an ark and immediately forgetting this, Harry comes back home.\n\n\n "

        "Summary_1": "One of the government restrictions that Edna reminds Harry about is the rationing of meat. Due to the crisis in the country, there is a shortage of meat. Instead of actual meat, most people eat multi-pro, which is similar to spam. The government also sets up boundaries for the residents to stay inside of, and they are not allowed to go past these regulations or else the police will come. The government also takes care of supplies, and most residents just have to write down what they want and pay a bill. In terms of money, the government takes care of it as well each week. Each farm receives the same number of animals because government agents paid flat rates. When Harry finds the stock of grain, he notes that the government has enough to keep going for a few years. Television is also restricted to old movies, playing only on one channel from nine to eleven at night. Later, it is revealed that these restrictions are imposed to keep the people alive on the ark long enough until they can begin to expand civilization again. ",
        "Summary_2": "Some of the government regulations included rationing the food. This included not being able to butcher their own meat,  but rather, having multi-pro. There was also a regulation about the type of farming allowed. Despite all the land, the government would pay the farmers for letting the fields remain empty as long as they only farm vegetables, and not wheat or corn. \n\nAdditionally, there are regulations on travel and gas. You were not able to go further than your neighbor's house. There is also an education regulation that says children should be at least 5 years and 9 months old before beginning to learn and read through a kindergarten book. ",
        "Summary_3": "The travel regulation restricts the area that people can travel to, which means their own houses and the closest neighbor's house. Whoever breaks the travel regulation will be sent to see the doctor. People buy their living necessities through delivery weekly by the rationing regulation. The farming regulations prohibit the plantation of wheat and corn, only allowing vegetables to be grown, resulting in many fields fallow. People would get compensated by the government for not planting wheat or corn. The rationing regulation allocates foods and living necessities for each family, regulates the supplies people can get, and prohibits people from butchering their livestock. Everyone has the same amount of livestock. Gas and water are also rationed that each family can only have a sink of water for dishes each day and a tub of bath water twice a week. The television regulation limits the channel to one, restricts the watching time to only nine to eleven at night, and constrains the audience to watch the listed movies only. Emergency Education Regulations claim that children should be at least five years nine months old to learn kindergarten books.",
        "Summary_4": "They cannot cultivate wheat and corn, and these fields are not in use. There are meat rations that significantly limit the amount of meat one household can consume. Harry also thinks about the travel regulations - he can't go further than Walt and Gloria Shanks' place. They live a little more than a mile away from Harry and Edna. There is gas rationing. The livestock is controlled by the government, too -  every household has the same number of chickens, sheep, cows, etc. We learn about the Emergency Education Regulations - every child should be five years nine months old before embarking on a kindergarten book.

YOUNG\n  \n \n  They were lovely and quick\n   \n  to learn\u2014and their only\n   \n  faults were little ones!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old\nbooks had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue.\nNot that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n  \n<doc-sep>A station wagon came up behind them, slowed, and matched its speed\nwith theirs. \"Someone's following us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"Probably Jilka.\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the station wagon turned down a side street and\ndisappeared. \"She's no longer with us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"She's got to pick someone up. She'll meet us later.\"\n  \n \n  \"At your folks'?\"\n  \n \n  \"At the ship.\"\n  \n \n  The city was thinning out around them now, and a few stars were visible\nin the night sky. Quidley watched them thoughtfully for a while. Then:\n\"What ship?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The one we're going to\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  on.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Fieu Dayol?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Persei 17 to you. I said I was going to take you home to meet my\nfolks, didn't I?\"\n  \n \n  \"In other words, you're kidnapping me.\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head vehemently. \"I most certainly am not! Neither\naccording to interstellar law or your own. When you compromised me, you\nmade yourself liable in the eyes of both.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why pick on me? There must be plenty of men on\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  . Why\ndon't you marry one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"For two reasons: one, you're the particular man who compromised\nme. Two, there are\n   \n   not\n   \n  plenty of men on\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  . Our race is\nidentical to yours in everything except population-balance between the\nsexes. At periodic intervals the women on\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  so greatly\noutnumber the men that those of us who are temperamentally and\nemotionally unfitted to become spinsters have to look for\n   \n   wotnids\n   \n  \u2014or\nmates\u2014on other worlds. It's quite legal and quite respectable. As a\nmatter of fact, we even have schools specializing in alien cultures\nto expedite our activities. Our biggest problem is the Interstellar\nstatute forbidding us the use of local communications services and\nforbidding us to appear in public places. It was devised to facilitate\nthe prosecution of interstellar black marketeers, but we're subject to\nit, too, and have to contrive communications systems of our own.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why were all the messages addressed to you?\"\n  \n \n  \"They weren't messages. They were requisitions. I'm the ship's stock\ngirl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend\nturned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of\nher own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading\ntable, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine,\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  , Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard route\nto the shelf where Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  reposed, take the volume down,\nsurreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages\nand return it to the shelf.\n  \n \n  After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second\nmessage. It was as unintelligible as the first:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Habe\nwotnid ig ist ending ifedererer te.

He knew, at least, who Cai\nwas, and he knew\u2014from the reappearance of the words\n   \n   wotnid\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Fieu\nDayol\n   \n  and\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  \u2014that the two communications were in the\nsame code. And certainly it was reasonable to assume that the last\nword\u2014\n   \n   Yoolna\n   \n  \u2014was the name of the girl he had just seen, and that\nshe was a different person from the\n   \n   Klio\n   \n  whose name had appended the\nfirst message.\n  \n \n  He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book\nto the shelf and went back to the reading table and\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Kay didn't show up till almost closing time, and he was beginning\nto think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup till\ntomorrow when she finally walked in the door. She employed the same\ntactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by\nchance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same\nundetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n  \n \n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "Herbert Quidley finds a yellow paper with unintelligible words folded in the book called History of English Literature by Hippolyte Adolphe Taine. After he continues to work, he sees a girl come in, browse randomly, and take Taine\u2019s book. The girl quickly riffles through the book, puts it back on the shelf, and leaves the library. After the girl leaves, Quidley checks the book, noticing the disappearance of the yellow paper. He learns the girl\u2019s name, Kay Smith, from the librarian and goes home. On his way home, he guesses that the paper is a kind of message transmitted through an esoteric book. He guesses the identity of the person who might do this message job with Kay, none of which pleases him as he has a liking for the girl, so he decides to observe this messaging action for a while.\n\nThe following day, when Quidley waits at the library, a girl different from Kay comes to the library, puts another paper in Taine\u2019s book, and leaves. Quidley sees the paper and finds another batch of unintelligible words, from which he finds two common words, Fieu Dayol and snoll doper. He puts back the letter and goes back to his seat. When the library is about to close, Kay comes to take the paper and leaves. Quidley follows behind her into a coffee bar. He intentionally spills the sugar on her, which allows him to start talking to her. Throughout the conversation, Quidley reveals his identity as a profiliste and accepts Kay\u2019s request to make her a profile. They set up a time to meet next time. After they separate, Quidley goes home and writes a letter to his father for the allowance.\n\nTwo days later, Quidley goes to the library again and sits at his reading-table post with his favorite magazine. He sees the third woman come in and do the same thing as the previous girls. He reads the new message and returns to his apartment waiting for Kay. He thinks about the meaning of snoll doper. When Kay comes, they do something sexually. The following day, puzzled by the secret of the snoll doper, Quidley decides to read the message before the exchange happens. Kay finds out that Quidley is reading the message. She tells him to come with her to deliver the snoll doper to Jilka and meet her folks. When Quidley waits in the car, he realizes the possible true identity of Kay and what may happen next. Quidley learns from the conversation with Kay that they are heading to the ship to Fieu Dayol. He also learns that Kay is the ship\u2019s stock girl, and all the messages are actually requisitions for the snoll dopers. He realizes that he is kidnapped to another planet, Fieu Dayol, where women outnumber men. He sees a man with Jilka ascend the ship and disappear.

One day, he was in the public library when he saw a weird message scribbled on a bookmark in a random book. He then saw a very beautiful lady enter the library, and go to the book which had weird writing. Herbert learnt that her name was Kay. Herbert thought this was weird, but he thought it was even weirder when the next day another girl came and left another bookmark in the same book. Herbert understood that the girls were using the book as a means of communication, but he didn\u2019t understand the messages. After the original girl came back, Herbert decided to follow her to a bar in order to meet her. Herbert uses a trick in order to first approach her, and they end up getting to know each other. They agree to meet in a few days at Herbert\u2019s house. Herbert was very surprised to learn that there was a third woman communicating with the other two girls. After Herbert and Kay get to know each other more on their date, Herbert decides to confront Kay about her book in their next outing. When he confronts Kay, Kay tells him that she was in fact from an alien species, and that she used the books to communicate with her crew. Kay tells Herbert that he wants to take her to her home planet and mate with him, but when Herbert tries to refuse Kay takes out a shotgun and forces him onto their ship. ",
        "Summary_3": "Herbert Quidley\u2019s penchant for old books has never been much of a problem for him. He finds a sheet of yellow paper in one of his Taine tomes and unfolds it, making him wonder what high school students read. He notices a girl walk through the door, noting that she deposits a book at the librarian\u2019s desk and heads towards the literature section. Although Quidley lowers his eyes, he finds that she also has picked up the book that he had earlier. When he goes to see the book again later, he notes that the makeshift bookmark is now gone. He thinks back to the message again and wonders who could have left it for her. Quidley later finds out that the girl\u2019s friend is another girl, and he tries to figure out what the second message means. Kay shows up again to leave another message, and Quidley follows her out to an all-night coffee shop to get her attention by spilling sugar. He introduces himself to her, and she responds that her name is Kay Smith. He feels intimidated by the girl for a moment, before she asks if he is really willing to word-paint her profile. She asks if they can meet at his place, and he agrees. A date is set up, and Quidley goes home. Although Kay is not in town for the next two days, he notices that there is now a third woman involved. The message is impossible to understand again, and he wonders if they are part of some secret society. When Kay comes, she is wearing a beautiful dress. Later, as Quidley is coming up with a new novel idea, he finds the fourth message again. As he thinks about her, Kay suddenly appears and tells him to put the book back. He is curious as to why she can\u2019t just give Jilka a snoll doper, but Kay says it is because of regulations. Soon, she tells him that she is planning to take him back to Fieu Dayol because he had compromised her and because there are not enough men back on the planet. Kay also reveals that all of the messages were requisitions because she is the ship\u2019s stock girl. The two arrive at the ship, and Quidley watches as Jilka and another man board the ship. Quidley tries to protest against boarding the ship himself, but Kay points a snoll doper at him. He notices that the object looks strikingly like a shotgun. ",
        "Summary_4": "Herbert Quidley is at a library. He opens Taine's History of English Literature and finds a sheet of paper with unintelligible text. He picks up another book. While reading it, he sees a beautiful young girl enter the library, take the sheet of paper from Taine's book, get another random book from the shelf, and leave. The next day, he notices another girl who slips a piece of paper between the book\u2019s pages. When she leaves, he looks at the sheet of paper - it also has some unintelligible message. Later, the first girl - he calls her Kay - shows up and takes the message from the book. He follows her into a coffee bar. Quidley spills sugar on her lap, which helps him start a conversation with her. He tells her she can send him the cleaners\u2019 bill and gives her his business card with his name, address, and profession - profiliste. He explains that he paints profiles with words. She introduces herself and asks if we can paint her profile. They decide to meet two days later at his place. Before meeting with her, he spends some time in the library and sees another girl who leaves the third coded message. He is confused and doesn\u2019t understand why these girls are using this medium of communication. Quidley comes back home and waits for Kay. She arrives in a pretty white dress - he is mesmerized. They drink some bourbon and soon kiss. She tells him to postpone the dinner. The following evening Quidley goes to the library. He fantasizes about his future novel and finds a new message. Kay finds him reading the message. She look at the paper and then tells him to follow her. They get in her convertible, and Kay says that she has to deliver a snoll doper to Jilka, and then she will take Quidley to meet her folks. He admits to reading all their messages. She stops the car near a brick apartment building and leaves for several minutes. Quidley thinks of running away, but Kay comes back quickly. They drive to some ship which is supposed to take them to Fieu Dayol or Persei 17. She explains that she can and has to marry him now because he compromised her and because there are very few men on Fieu Dayol. She also tells him that those papers were requisitions, not messages - Kay is the ship\u2019s stock girl. They pull up to a ship, parked somewhere among country fields. Jilka arrives with some man who slowly walks to the ship. When Quidley refuses to go with them, Kay tells him that the Interstellar law allows them to take only the ones who do not conform to the sexual mores of their society. She presses a snoll doper - a term he saw in the messages and later asked about - against his back. He realizes it\u2019s something similar to a shotgun and starts marching up the plank. "

YOUNG\n  \n \n  They were lovely and quick\n   \n  to learn\u2014and their only\n   \n  faults were little ones!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old\nbooks had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue.\nNot that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n  \n<doc-sep>A station wagon came up behind them, slowed, and matched its speed\nwith theirs. \"Someone's following us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"Probably Jilka.\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the station wagon turned down a side street and\ndisappeared. \"She's no longer with us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"She's got to pick someone up.

He is a dreamer and can indulge in fantasizing about his future novel and the success it could bring. He is a romantic and loves conventionally beautiful things. He doesn\u2019t enjoy commitment - we understand that when he thinks about marriage as the most terrifying thing ever and almost runs away from Kay when he thinks that she\u2019s taking him to meet her parents. He loves mysteries, like the coded messages he finds in the library. As Kay says, he doesn\u2019t conform to the sexual mores of society - he likes relationships with no obligations. He also considers it normal to follow a woman without talking to her first and peer at her messages. "

        "Article": "In telling him that she would be in town two nights hence, Kay had\nunwittingly apprised him that there would be no exchange of messages\nuntil that time, so the next evening he skipped his vigil at the\nlibrary. The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  once again.\n  \n \n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n  \n \n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n  \n \n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n  \n \n \n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli!

Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the\nbook back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.\n  \n \n  He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what\na\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur\nsecret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged.\nIt virtually had to be an amateur secret society.

By the time the door chimes sounded he was his\nnormal self again.\n  \n \n  He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his\nshirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and\nlooked around the room to see if everything was in place.

She employed the same\ntactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by\nchance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same\nundetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n  \n \n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it.

        "Summary_1": "Snoll doper appears in every letter that is hidden in History of English Literature by Hippolyte Adolphe Taine, a book favored by Hebert Quidley, from which he finds these letters and starts his observation. Quidley finds these words several times when he secretly reads the letters in the book whenever a girl comes to put a new letter in the book. He is fascinated by the first girl called Kay Smith who takes the first letter after he notices it. From then on, he has been guessing the meaning of snoll doper. At first, Quidley thinks that snoll doper means a person who has close relationships with Kay, like a boyfriend or a husband. He is annoyed by this possibility after having sexual behaviors with Kay, which causes him to secretly read the fourth letter before Kay comes to pick it up. When Kay finds out that Quidley has been reading her letter, she tells him to come with her to deliver the snoll doper to Jilka, where Quidley is relieved because he realizes that snoll doper is the name of an object, not an identity. On their way to Jilka\u2019s place, Quidley keeps asking Kay what the meaning of snoll doper is, but Kay doesn\u2019t tell him. At the end of the story, snoll doper turns out to be the name of a shotgun, which is what the letters are for, a requisition for the shotgun. Those letters are sent toward Kay because she is the ship\u2019s stock girl who delivers the guns. In conclusion, snoll doper is a word that puzzles Quidley throughout the whole story and causes him to be caught by Kay, the purpose of those secret letters transmitted between Kay and other girls through the book, and an object that forces Quidley to go into the ship.",
        "Summary_2": "The snoll doper is an important part of the story because it was a part of all of the messages. When Herbert read all of the different messages scribbled in bookmarks, he saw that the names of the girls repeated in every message, as well as the words: snoll doper. He was very curious to understand what they meant, so he decided to meet Kay. After Kay tells Herbet who she is, Herbert asks her whan snoll dopers are. She responds by taking out a shotgun-like weapon and forcing him onto their ship. ",
        "Summary_3": "The snoll doper is mentioned in the very first message that Quidley reads. It is also this message that motivates him to investigate further into who Kay is and what exactly is a snoll doper. Most of the story revolves around him trying to crack the meaning behind snoll doper, and he wonders if he could just ask Kay directly about it when she comes to his apartment. The snoll dopper is also largely relevant in helping him figure out what the next The snoll doper is still relevant either, after he finds out Kay\u2019s identity and has to go back to her planet with her. ",
        "Summary_4": "Snoll doper is one of the phrases that Quidley finds in the unintelligible messages from the library. It intrigues him because he doesn\u2019t understand what it means. It makes him think about its potential meaning. Eventually, it leads to his mini-relationship with Kay. When he asks her about this term, she says she will share its meaning later. Thus, she brings him to the ship without any trouble and knows she can use her snoll doper in case Quidley refuses to go. When he does, she presses a snoll doper - a tool similar to a shotgun - against his back and orders him to enter the ship. "

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "This story follows the Martian Maid\u2019s journey and features its crew members: a captain nicknamed \u2018Captain Midas\u2019, Mister Spinelli the Third Officer, and various other shipmates. It is revealed that many of the crew members have a lust for making money, and an apt opportunity to do so is discovered when Mister Spinelli spots a derelict ship amongst the asteroids that could be claimed by them. After a first exploration, Midas ends up with a mystery metal collected from the starship. In his further investigation, he finds that this mystery metal transforms into a heavier metal with a yellow tinge - gold. At the same time, he finds that holding the metal evokes fatigue in him, particularly in his arms. This initial investigation was interrupted by Spinelli barging into Midas\u2019 quarters and spotting the gold. Fearful of the other shipmates knowing and hence collecting it for themselves, Midas threatens Spinelli\u2019s silence. \n\nMidas continues the acquisition of this derelict ship by sending a crew, led by Cohn, to further investigate and take control of the ship. With Midas and Spinelli left behind, they watch their shipmates enter the alien ship. While waiting to hear back from the crew, Midas notices that Spinelli has arranged the Maid\u2019s gun to point at the derelict ship and their crew mates. Initially enraged, Midas soon calms down as he begins to suspect that the rest of the crew knows about the gold and may be hatching an alternate plan. Two days past the check-in time, the pair receives a garbled message from the crew. Midas orders them to disembark and depart, but the starship begins to divert its course. In arguing between something being wrong and Spinelli telling the crew about the gold, Spinelli begins to inch towards the firing panel for the gun and a tussle emerges between the two with Midas killing him. \n\nAfter re-catching the derelict ship, Midas boards the ship to look for the rest of his crew mates. He finds the walls to turn into yellow metal and the decks to have a yellowish cast as well. Inside the ship, he sees skeletal and rusty versions of his crew, and comes to the horrifying realization that the transformation of the metal into gold comes at the expense of him and his crew member\u2019s youth and strength. Running from the ship, Midas reboards the Maid and quickly throws the alien ship back into space. Back on Callisto, the Foundation relieves him of his command as the illness spreads to the rest of his body. \n",
        "Summary_2": "This story is about the last spatial flight of Captain Midas. He lives in a time when humans have explored and deemed safe the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle. At the beginning, he talks about greedy human nature and what it can cause. Years ago, he was a skipper of the Martian Maid spaceship flying to Callisto. His crew - Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski - people with love for money, not noble pioneers. They detected a derelict in the supra-solar void between the EMV Triangle and the outer systems. First, they thought it was The Holcomb Foundation ship, but this one was the largest craft they had ever seen. It was on a near-collision course and probably came in from the direction of Coma Berenices - the stars. He gathered the crew and informed them that they were entitled to claim this derelict as salvage. Everyone got excited and started thinking about the money they could get for this craft. The skipper was supposed to report their finding to the EMV base. But Midas decided to do that after receiving the money for its parts. When they got near the craft, Midas noticed that the metal of its flanks was grained with glittering whorls. They realized it was a starship, and it probably had been roaming through space for millennia. It was gashed deeply by something. Cohn and three other men came back disappointed, saying there was nothing valuable inside. He brought two samples of the ship\u2019s metal. Midas examined the chunks at his work-table, and soon the metal grew yellower. He spent some time testing the sample, and it became stable, drawing the necessary energy from somewhere, and turned into gold. Spinelli unexpectedly came into his office and noticed the piece of gold. He volunteers to go onboard the derelict, but Midas refuses. He also orders Spinelli not to say anything about the precious stone. Captain then saw Spinelli murmuring something to Zaleski and also felt inexplicably tired. He assigned  Marvin and Chelly to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk in case of mutiny. With time, the number of messages from Cohn started decreasing, and they came through garbled. They sent a strange message that stated that they had lost control. Spinelli got infuriated and almost fired at the big ship from the supersonic rifle. Midas aggressively ordered him to stop, and Spinelli attacked him. After a short fight, Midas killed the officer and immediately noticed that his hands were sickly purple. He put on a pressure suit and decided to go onboard the derelict. Inside he saw his crewmates, their skeletal bodies, and old faces. The walls around them were gold. Midas realized that the ship\u2019s metal was taking the energy required to make it stable from people who touched it. He ran and threw all the gold away. Midas landed on Callisto and was relieved of his command. The illness slowly spread from his hands to other body parts. Now he\u2019s in a hospital and looks eighty though he\u2019s thirty two. \n\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Midas lives on the spacemen\u2019s pension from Holcomb Foundation. He starts a story about his experience of once having a tremendous amount of treasure. The story begins with him and the crew members on the spaceship Martian Maid when they find a massive derelict in the outer system of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle in space. Mister Spinelli is the first one to find the derelict. After he reports to the captain, and the captain measures the course of the derelict, they decide to search over the hulk based on the Space Regulation that any derelict belongs to the discoverer. They sense the chance of treasure in the derelict, searching over it without reporting to the nearest EMV base. At first, they do not find anything valuable inside the ship, so they decide to bring the whole derelict. Mister Cohn brings two pieces of the metal constituting the derelict to the captain.  When the captain examines the metal, he finds his hand grows bony and old while the metal becomes gold. He realizes that the metal can somehow transmute the energy to the property of metal, stabilizing itself to become gold. Mister Spinelli witnesses this discovery when the captain is trying in his room. When Mister Spinelli asks the captain whether he can help take the derelict abroad, the captain denies his request and orders him not to leak the information about the metal. Mister Spinelli tells Zaleski, who will take care of the derelict, about the metal. The captain orders the rest of the members to help Zaleski, ensuring that he cannot take the derelict himself. The captain sets the radar finder to watch the derelict. While Spinelli and the captain watch over the derelict with a turret pointing toward it, the message from Mister Cohn, who takes charge of the crew on the derelict, starts to decrease. When they find the derelict begins to get out of sight, Spinelli suspects them of betraying and attacks the captain, while the captain senses the danger of the decreasing message and fights back. The captain kills Mister Spinelli. As the captain examines his hand\u2019s condition, he realizes something goes wrong. The captain controls the Maid to catch up with the derelict, attempting to shoot it but fails. He wears the pressure suit and goes to the derelict, finding the prize crew aged and caress the metal. He realizes that the energy the metal draws comes from organic life, which in this situation is humans. He runs to the Maid, throws away any alien metals, and flees. And now, he lives on the spacemen\u2019s pension, old and weary when he should be young and strong.",
        "Summary_4": "The captain of the Martian Maid starts off describing gold and the greatness of the treasure. He begins to mention how old he is, and he is also poor because he would not be here otherwise. The man goes further on to describe how people of his generation did not let anything go because they were entitled to keep whatever they found. He begins talking about how he is the skipper of the Martian Maid, and the rest of the crew ride a golden ship that they paid for with their lives. He begins to talk about the experience not too long ago, how none of the crew would have known that this was their last flight. He thinks about the sweet payload they would pick up in Callisto from delivering all of the cargo. The captain also mentions how dangerous the asteroid belt was for astrogation at the time. The story then cuts to Spinelli reporting a derelict to the rest of the crew. Once they are near the collision, an abandoned spacer is found. However, even though they have claim over the ship, the captain\u2019s calculations show that it came from beyond the stars. Everybody becomes excited at the prospect of money; the derelict is much bigger than anything the Foundation Yards have ever built. It is also damaged too, as there is a gash from the stem to the stern with a jagged rip in its bare mangled innards. Some of the men are sent to go explore the ship, but they come back disappointed that there is nothing worthy left inside. The ship itself was never built to carry humans, but the crew still decides to take her along. When the captain puts the metal through the metallurgical testing kit, however, he discovers that it is gold. Spinelli tells him that the derelict is ready, but the captain makes him stay on the Maid with him. A few other members of the crew seem to be planning something, and the captain wonders if there is a chance that they will take off with the treasure ship. Spinelli reveals later that he did tell Zaleski about the gold, but they receive a message about losing control on the ship. Spinelli leaps at the captain, and the two of them fight. When the captain realizes that Spinelli is dead, he suddenly looks at his arms and sees how old he has become. He goes to the gold ship and sees the rest of the crew as almost skeletal beings. Realizing that the gold draws energy from them, he discards all of it and speeds away in the Maid. He is relieved of his duty on Callisto, and the Foundation refuses him another ship. The captain is thirty-two, but he looks eighty and is stuck on a hospital cot. The bitterest part is people laugh and call him Captain Midas when he tells this story. "

        "Summary_1": "Captain Midas is the captain of the spaceship Martian Maid, who unknowingly takes the spaceship on its last flight in this story. He is described to be relatively young at 32 years old, but after interacting with the metal and at the end of the story, has the physical appearance of an eighty year old man with wrinkles and veiny hands. \n\nHe is a greedy man. In the beginning of the story, he honestly admits that he would do quite a few things for a few solar dollars, which we see throughout the story. In addition to his greed, he is a selfish man, as in discovering the gold he threatens Spinelli to secrecy in order to keep the highest gains for himself. It is also this greed that allows Spinelli to get away with initially aiming the gun at the derelict ship and their fellow shipmates on board in case those shipmates try to escape with the gold.  \n\nThere are brief moments where he is shown to be an honorable man. For one, he fights Spinelli over blasting their fellow shipmates, and ends up killing Spinelli instead by accident.

        "Summary_2": "Captain Midas is a spaceman, a skipper of the Martian Maid spaceship. He is confident, experienced, and a natural leader - he can feel how the mood of his crew changes and what they are able to do. He knows how Spinelli and Zaleski can act if they find out about the gold and tries to be cautious. He is greedy - Midas gets blinded by the prospect of getting lots of money for the metal parts of the derelict and initially doesn\u2019t notice the metal\u2019s unique feature. Still, he values his team and finds it disgusting that Spinelli would be ready to kill his own colleagues for some gold. Midas also attempts to learn what happened to them when Spinelli gets out of control and thinks that the other members of the team betrayed him and stole his gold. He doesn\u2019t feel normal after killing Spinelli - Midas doesn\u2019t enjoy violence. ",
        "Summary_3": "Captain Midas is the captain of the spaceship Martian Maid. He looks bony, wrinkled, and weary. He looks eighty when he is thirty-two. He is greedy for money as he and the whole crew search every possibility in space to find treasure or things that can be traded for money. His greed also makes him not report to the interplanetary base when the crew finds the derelict. He prioritizes his lust for treasure over his duty as a captain, suspecting everyone on the ship to steal the derelict, but he also maintains his reason in the situation where the lust for treasure may surpass his duty as a captain. This can be shown when Mister Spinelli and the captain find it hard to read the message from the crewmembers on the derelict; he senses the danger while Mister Spinelli only thinks about his treasure. He is rational that all his actions have a reason, such as letting Mister Spinelli set the weapon pointing toward the derelict to ensure the rest of the crew members do not steal the treasure and flee. He has the moral that he feels guilty when he kills Mister Spinelli.",

He works alongside the rest of the crew, consisting of Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, and Zaleski. The captain is only thirty-two, but he looks eighty by the end of the story. Physically, he is described as having gray hair, flesh hanging off of his bone like a yellow cloth, and face a mask. He is a hard-working man, willing to go to any means to earn his share of money. He is also poor, which is why he was so driven to keep the treasure ship when he found it. Captain Midas, however, is a lot more level-headed than the rest of the crew. He is aware of the dangers of being gold-hungry, which is why he keeps this finding to himself. The captain is also observant, figuring out the ship had come from beyond the stars based on his charts. However, even though he is a lot more level-headed, the captain is also susceptible to the idea of becoming insanely rich off of the golden ship. He is not against taking the ship with them and even sleeps with the gold chunk underneath his bed. Midas is also not afraid to use brute force, considering how he killed Spinelli when the other man attacked. "

A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n",
        "Summary_1": "This story takes place in the Holcomb Foundation aboard Martian Maid. The Martian Maid is a grand ship that took off from Solis Lacus on its last flight; the ship spanned 200 feet in its length and despite its sleek exterior, was an armed ship as well. The Maid was on an orbit in a region strewn with asteroids between the outer systems and the EMV triangle. \n\nAboard the spaceship, interactions between the characters in the story largely took place in the Control room. It also takes place in Captain Midas\u2019 quarters, where he investigates the mystery metal. The setting also changes to include the derelict ship the crewmates had found, which presented itself as a shell of a vessel with torn interiors and yellow-tinged walls. \n",
        "Summary_2": "After the character\u2019s inner monologue finishes, Midas starts talking about the day his team took off on the Martian Maid spaceship. He watched the lights of Canalopolis: gin mills and houses reflected on the ancient canal\u2019s water, the bright moons cast their shadows across the banks. They were leaving the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle and moving towards the outer systems, specifically the planet called Callisto. Midas spent most of his time in the Control room. He gathered the crew there to tell them about the derelict. At his quarters, Midas examined the metal samples sitting at his work-table. Days later, in the control room with a control panel, a radar finder, and a firing console, Midas killed Spinelli, who had attacked him. He then decided to find his team. He entered the living quarters of the prize crew. The walls were gleaming. Then, Midas swiftly reached the Maid and flew to Callisto. Now he\u2019s in a hospital cot.\n\n",
        "Summary_3": "The story happens on two spaceships. One is Martian Maid, which is a two hundred feet long spaceship. It is sleek, chemical-fueled, and spherical. It is equipped with weapons, such as turrets. There is a telescope, radar, and a book rack above the desk in the captain\u2019s room. The other is the derelict. It is tremendously gigantic. It has a sleek torpedo shape with unknown alienness. Its flanks are constituted with glittering whorls. It is torn apart severely. There are a few storage compartments inside.",
        "Summary_4": "The story is primarily set in space. When the Martian Maid first takes off, it leaves from Solis Lacus after being taken out of the Foundation Yards. The ship is headed towards Callisto, where everybody will be receiving a fat paycheck. There is a Earth-Mars-Venus triangle that provides relative security for space travel. However, the outer systems are much more dangerous. The Captain also watches Canalopolis from a distance before he has to leave. The Maid has a scope position and living quarters for the crew. There is also an area called Control, where everybody is called to meet. The golden ship they find is made fully out of gold. The treasure ship has yellowish decks and an airlock compartment set aside for the crew. The entire ship gleams, but it is made out of devil metal. After the captain escapes to Callisto, he is subjected to a hospital cot for the rest of his life. "

        "Query": "What is the dynamic between Captain Midas and Mister Spinelli in the story of CAPTAIN MIDAS?",
        "Article": "A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the\ndoorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black\neyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table.\nHe needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me\nthat his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was\nthe meaning of the expression on his heavy face.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Spinelli!\" I snapped, \"In the future knock before entering my\nquarters!\"\n  \n \n  Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. \"From the\nderelict, Captain?\" There was an imperceptible pause between the last\ntwo words.\n  \n \n  I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand on\nthe rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Speak your piece, Mister,\" I ordered sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prize\ncrew ... sir,\" he said slowly. \"I'd like to volunteer for that detail.\"\n  \n \n  I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was a\nfirst class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk would\nneed good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned me\nto beware. I shook my head. \"You will stay on board the Maid with me,\nSpinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.\"\n  \n \n  Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turning\nslowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat\nhim of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.\n  \n \n  \"We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister\nSpinelli,\" I said deliberately, \"Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is\nthat clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye, sir,\" murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face\nand there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he\nturned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like\nhim to let it go at that.\n  \n \n  Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't\nfunctioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I\nrubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering\nabout Spinelli.\n  \n \n  Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, and\nafter that there was tension in the air. Distrust.\n  \n \n  For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat\nto clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first\nplace I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the\nsecond place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.\n  \n \n  I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and\nI was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that\nthere was no double-cross.\n  \n \n  I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the\nrest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk.\nThat way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the\ntreasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they\nwere to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.\n  \n \n  I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with\nthat starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. Finally\nI had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I had\nset the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly.

        "Summary_1": "Mister Spinelli is Third Officer under the command of Captain Midas and was the first to report the derelict ship and observe its potential to be claimed by the Maid. Spinelli is the first and only crew member to identify the metal from the abandoned ship as gold when he saw Captain Midas with it. The tension between Midas and Spinelli escalates and their relationship becomes antagonistic as both of them desire to benefit the most from this valuable gold and with Midas constantly pulling his authority over Spinelli. After Midas barrs him from being a part of the investigative crew, suspicion arises between the two as Spinelli suspects Midas wishes to keep the pot of gold for himself and Midas thinks that Spinelli may be telling others. This tension further escalates as Midas sees Spinelli nearly hit the trigger of the gun and in rage, the two end up fighting each other before Midas aimed a kick at his temple and killed him. \n",
        "Summary_2": "Captain Midas knows about Mister Spinelli\u2019s hunger for money and gold. When the officer noticed the chunk of gold on Midas\u2019 table, the captain started analyzing what the crewman could do. He refused to allow Spinelli to go aboard the derelict, and from this point, their relationship became tense. The crewman suspected the captain of an intention to take all the gold. Midas saw that Spinelli told Zaleski about gold and sent several other crew members to the derelict with Zaleski and Cohn to avoid double-crossing or mutiny. When they left, he realized that Spinelli aimed the Maid\u2019s firing projector at the derelict and the crew members there in case they decided to betray Spinelli. Midas got angry but decided to leave this way. When their colleagues sent a message about the lost control and then stopped answering, Spinelli became mad. Midas attempted to keep Spinelli in control, but the man was already approaching the firing panel. Spinelli got an order to leave the control room, but he exploded and attacked his superior. In an aggressive fight, Midas killed his team member. ",
        "Summary_3": "The relationship between Captain Midas and Mister Spinelli changes from supportive to hostile throughout the story. When Mister Spinelli finds the massive derelict in the space, he reports back to Captain Midas. He actively suggests searching over the hulk, where his relationship with Captain Midas is superior-subordinate and obeying. However, when Captain Midas finds out that the mysterious metal sought from the derelict can somehow turn into gold, which Mister Spinelli witnesses, their greed sprouts the tension and suspicion between them as they start to suspect each other of trying to have the gold by themselves. The first tension arises when Captain Midas does not allow Mister Spinelli to move the hulk. In addition, Mister Spinelli disobeys Captain Midas\u2019s order not to tell other crew members about the metal. The second tension arises when Mister Spinelli uses the weapon on the spaceship pointing toward the derelict to ensure no one can steal his share of the metal. Captain Midas is raged about his action at first, but he accepts that. The last tension arises when they lose the signal from other crew members, causing them to suspect the betrayal of other members. From then on, Mister Spinelli attacks Captain Midas, and they fight until Captain Midas kills Mister Spinelli. Until this point, their relationship is hostile and competitive in the sense of the ownership of the metal.",
        "Summary_4": "Captain Midas and Mister Spinelli initially get along fine. Spinelli listens to all of his orders, and the Captain considers him to be a reliable member of the crew. There is no sense of hostility between them, and he even agrees with Spinelli\u2019s proposal to look the ship over. However, this relationship later sours once Spinelli finds out that the discovered ship is made out of gold. The captain is wary because Spinelli is big and dangerous, preferring to keep an eye on him in case anything goes wrong. Spinelli, on the other hand, is suspicious of the captain and goes off to tell Zaleski even though the captain said to not mention the gold to any of the rest of the crew. The captain threatens to clap Spinelli to irons, but this threat does not work because the Third Officer chooses to disobey his orders anyways. Later, Spinelli and the captain get into conflict again, with Spinelli accusing the captain that he was planning to keep all of the treasure for himself. Spinelli assumes that everybody is faking it to keep the ship, but the captain knocks him away. The two of them fight brutally, and Captain Midas has to end up killing Spinelli. "

        "Summary_1": "The mystery metal is significant because it initially attracted the crew\u2019s interest due to their greed - they had hoped to tear about the derelict starship and sell its pieces for millions. When the Captain tested out the mysterious metal and saw that it turned out to be gold, his greed increased so much that he became suspicious of his crew members that were sent out to investigate the ship. \n\nAlthough the Captain and his crew thought they could take advantage of this metal and benefit from it, it turns out that the opposite is true. Instead, it is this mystery metal that gains its yellow-tint and subsequent gold composition through drawing its energy from them and draining the crew of their youth and strength. The latter named \u2018devil-metal\u2019 demonstrates the hastiness of the greed of man, and how it led them to be so enraptured in greed that it blinded them of the wariness of strange objects in space, and hence led to their ultimate demise. \n",
        "Summary_2": "All the spacemen in this story are greedy and materialistic. When the Maid\u2019s crew finds the derelict, they think of selling its parts. This thought cheers them up. Then Midas finds out the starship\u2019s metal can turn into gold, and Spinelli learns that, too. Eventually, this chunk of gold makes Midas\u2019 hands slowly decay while he sleeps with it every night. Spinelli becomes more and more suspicious and suspects everyone to be a traitor. Eventually, Midas realizes the starship\u2019s metal has some evil in it. When he finds his team almost dead and still trying to climb the golden walls of the room, he understands that the metal takes the energy required for its stability from humans. This gold quite literally kills. Greed ends the lives of almost all crewmates of the Maid and leaves Midas to slowly die in a hospital cot, regretting his lethal hunger for money.",
        "Summary_3": "The mystery metal from the derelict can draw energy from life and turn itself into gold through the transmutation of the energy. In the story, the crews on Maid, a spaceship, find a large derelict constituted of this mysterious metal and bring it with them. Soon after they find out its property of becoming gold, they start to fight with each other and caress the metal unstoppably, but they do not know where the energy that makes the metal change comes from. After the captain kills one crewmember, finding the lost signals and weirdness of his hand and the metal, he realizes the metal draws the needed energy from humans. The mysterious metal plays a significant role in that it triggers the greed of the crewmembers to cause them to fight, symbolizing the cursed treasure. It is also the leading cause that most crew members die or mutate, except for the captain, showing that any treasure comes with a cost, in which case, the mysterious metal is the treasure, and the life is the cost.",
        "Summary_4": "The mystery metal, later revealed to be \u2018gold\u2019, is significant because it is what drives the crew to want to become rich and leads to their downfall. When the captain first discovers it is gold, he thinks about how wealthy the entire crew will become once they reach Callisto and sell it off. The mystery metal is worth a lot of money, and it is what makes them decide to take the entire ship with them. However, this metal is also deadly because it sucks the energy from the crew. Out of their greed, they fail to realize that the gold drains their lifespan away to continue functioning. The crew has to pay the ultimate price with their lives, and only Captain Midas survives the incident. Even as they are old and skeletal, the rest of the crew do not want to give up the possibility of gold. When the captain goes to Callisto, everybody scorns him and laughs at him despite how terrible his story is about the gold. "
